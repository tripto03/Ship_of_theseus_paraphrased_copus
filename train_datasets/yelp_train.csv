Human,yelp-0,"This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under 9.00, to the raved BBQ Baby Back Ribs, to their NY pizza joint. The food is abundant, inexpensive, and good.'The place for the locals', the payouts are great, and the vibe is kickback from the craziness hoopla from the Strip. Their legendary karaoke room has been around longer than the fad itself. A strong recommend for any tourist who.wants something other than the Strip."

From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under 9.00, to the new modern decor, it's always been the same old reliable place to get a great meal for a reasonable price. The freshest of ingredients, all cooked in house and served up in a warm and friendly atmosphere."
LLAMA,yelp-0,"This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under 9.00, to the days of the all you can eat buffet, to the today with the daily specials and great burgers. The owner has worked there since I was a kid and knows everyone by name. I have eaten there on days when they have no menu out and I have had to tell the waitress what I want and she goes to the kitchen and they cook it for me! My dad passed away in 2004, but his family has not left his favorite restaurant. The food is great and the owners are great. From Business: Established in 2006, The Arbor Bar Grill is an American cuisine restaurant located in Bay Shore, NY. 22. Sweet Treats Ice Cream Candy Shop Inc. Awesome food. Great service. A little pricey but worth it."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-0,"This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under 9.00, to the current day of 'all items are available'. The food is old school and cheaply priced (less than 8 bucks), with no frills attached...just good honest home-style cooking like grandma used make it! The portions here can feed three or four people very well - which makes this an ideal spot if your party isn't too large but everyone wants something different from dinner anyway..and they have lotsa beer there as icing onto cake!! Jammed most nights so get in early before ""the rush"" gets outta hand!!!"

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they are always willing to help you choose the perfect meal. They also have a great selection of wines to pair with your meal. If you're looking for a great place to eat with family or friends, I highly recommend this place."
BigScience,yelp-0,"This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under 9.00, to the thousands that have gone by, Rusty and Anne have brought us wonderful food at affordable prices. After all this time they still continue to make our meals memorable! We were lucky enough to get some of their outstanding desserts. One was something called an 'old school ice cream sandwich' - made with vanilla bean ice cream between two flaky pastries in which a piece of old-fashioned chocolate cake sat as its centerpiece (I had no idea what it tasted like until I saw photos on Facebook). The other dessert we enjoyed was homemade cherry pie filling served in mini cakes with fresh cherries baking on top! In addition to dining here every night after work, we've often visited during business hours too. When working out there are always open tables so if you're hungry while waiting for your colleagues to finish up, there's nothing wrong with stopping in and having lunch or dinner instead. Our last visit before heading home was quite special because a friend had just moved into her own apartment across from this restaurant, where she works part-time. So upon walking inside we met three friends who loved this spot even more than we did!"
Human,yelp-1,"The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor. It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest. When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert? I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here. Now to the substance. Peppermill is an institution. It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from Casino filmed there with Sharon Stone. The food is average, at best. It is also overpriced. The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion. The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced. The appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced. Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item. I recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip. The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet. And more fun. Are you noticing a trend here? I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced."

BigScience,yelp-1,"The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best thing about The Peppermill is its barbecue sauce - which was nailed perfectly for my tastes - and its burgers: beef patties from quality meats, but with an odd mix of onion-rind crumbles, brie cheese and smoky herbs. I realize we're not talking gourmet fare here; although I have no doubt the restaurant's menu will improve over time as Chef Nate develops his signature cuisine. (And yes, buns are included.) But there were plenty of good things at The Peppermill, such as the large lunch plates (including new offerings like macaroni salad) or the red-wine-braised cod served with purple sweet potato puree and salty shallots. One slight misstep came in the form of The Bad-Luck Cheese Sandwiches, named after a series of food-related disasters that occurred within 10 feet of the restaurant. (Cleansers, pasta sauces sprayed on counter tops by mistake? You get what you paid for.) If you're looking for somewhere cool to hangout while eating delicious food, go visit Lapa Grill Bar for your next date night!"
LLAMA,yelp-1,"The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best time to go here is after midnight when the place gets jumping and the cocktails start flowing. Cocktail waitresses dress in rhinestone studded bikinis, and the crowd is a mix of working stiffs and 20-somethings. The drinks are tasty, and the food is passable. The best thing about this place is the prices. A 1.95 drink menu. A 4.95 breakfast menu. And best of all, a 6.95 prime rib dinner. The menu also features a Cajun menu that isn't bad at all. The Peppermill is on The Strip, near the Riviera."
Tsinghua,yelp-1,"The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best part of this bar is the staff. They're friendly and courteous, with just a hint of coolness. I'd love to know what kind of job it is to have that coolness. They're like the attractive ""nerds"" in the local library. There's nothing quite like having a waitress come up and say ""Good morning, sir."" In my defense, I'm not the kind of guy who looks at waitresses the same way other guys do. (Though I do get a kick out of seeing the little smirk on the guys' faces when the girls at the bar give them the eye.) There's a variety of entertainment for the ears and eyes, but I have to admit, the food is rather mediocre. And I'm not even a fan of meatloaf. The restaurant is across the street from the hotel, so the bar patrons are a mix of hotel guests, businesspeople, and tourists. It's one of those places where the place lights are low, the music is a bit loud, and the service is slow. The decor is typical for a chain hotel bar, and while I'm not going to knock the shabby stuff, I do think that there's a better way to spend the money."
OpenAI,yelp-1,"The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best way to describe the Peppermill is that it's a unique and eclectic destination that combines vintage Las Vegas charm with modern amenities. The decor may be over-the-top and flashy, but it adds to the overall fun and playful atmosphere of the establishment. Additionally, the Peppermill offers a range of restaurants, bars, and entertainment options, making it a popular destination for locals and tourists alike."
PaLM,yelp-1,"The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best place to go for a late night cocktail in Vegas (although there's not a whole lot of competition). The Peppermill is a true Vegas institution, having been around for nearly 50 years. It's a great place to people-watch, and the drinks are strong and cheap. (The prices have gone up a bit in recent years, but they're still a bargain compared to most other places in Vegas.) The Peppermill is also a great place to see some Vegas history. The walls are covered with photos of celebrities who have visited the restaurant over the years, including Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Marilyn Monroe. If you're looking for a truly unique Vegas experience, then you need to check out the Peppermill. The Peppermill is located on the north end of the Strip, just across the street from the Golden Nugget. It's open 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-2,"Although the space itself is really beautiful, My first visit to St. Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's. On the plus side, there are some great places along Main Street (mostly on its west end) that offer a variety in options from tacos at La Vida Loca Taqueria or pizza by Nightmare Pizza Company all up one block toward Alameda Rd., while across town you'll find Jamba Juice as well! Also: I found out about this place when my husband told his co-workers he was going bowling before work; they were shocked because ""you're too smart"" but we have been back every week since then!! We love everything here - especially our personal favorite Thai chicken with peanut sauce appetizer!"""
Human,yelp-2,"Although the space itself is really beautiful, My first visit to St. Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's. On the plus side, our party of 6 was seated without wait, the wait staff provide lots of good eye candy and the service was friendly and prompt. The food was just ok. I had the fried egg sandwich which comes with their roasted fingerling potatoes and small ramekins of their'Mexican ketchup' and chipotle mayo. Everything on the plate was boring. There are just too many ways to make a great breakfast potato, so these bland, unseasoned fingerlings were disappointing and neither condiment wowed me. I thought it odd that no salt or pepper were on any table and I thought I might insult the chef by asking for them. I assumed the absence of such basic'comforts' must mean they believe everything is coming out of the kitchen perfectly seasoned. Guess again guys. It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a'holy socks Batman, this is killer!!'. Nope, not a single holy anything in the beautifully styled St. Francis. My other non food related negatives are the lack of parking and the VERY uncomfortable seating. They do offer complimentary valet service in their postage stamp sized lot but it looked like a crazed chess game as we waited (in the rain) for a stupid long time for the valet to'free' our cars. The seating is bench style, on which there are no backs, so you are either practicing perfect posture throughout you meal or you are leaning into the backs of perfect strangers. Either way, it is weird and uncomfortable. All in all, I most likely wouldn't go out of my way to go back."
LLAMA,yelp-2,"Although the space itself is really beautiful, My first visit to St. Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's. On the plus side, the food was decent and not too expensive. The wine list was well-curated, with many bottles that I hadn't seen before. My date and I had a plate of assorted charcuterie and then a pork loin and duck breast entree. I was very pleased with the charcuterie, which included a sourdough rye, a spicy chorizo, a mild salami, and a tasty ""pate maison."" The pork loin was a bit overdone, but the duck was very tender. The sauces were too acidic for my tastes (I'm a lover of sauces, but I don't like to taste the vinegar), but I know that many other diners appreciate that taste. The service was attentive, but somewhat obtrusive. The food came out in a timely manner, but not too quickly. My only real complaint was the noise level, which was quite high and a bit unnerving. The music was loud and the space is open. On the other hand, I'm glad that St. Francis has stayed true to its roots and not tried to be fancy.

On the plus side, I was transported back in time as well. I highly recommend this place! The vibe is amazing - a little bit hipstery but not overdone the menu has something for everyone! We visited on our way home from Naples after having taken two tours there (one chapel tour one cooking class). We had reservations at 9:30am so got up early enough to catch it before they got too crowded. If you go here be prepared that you'll have a wait since it's located right next door to Sacred Heart Convent which is a busy nunnery. They will take your order do all the prep work just like if you'd gone into their kitchen yourself. There's no dress code (as far as I know) so feel free to wear whatever makes sense to you- that's what made us enjoy ourselves more than most other restaurants we went to during Italy."

A couple of weeks ago, I ordered two lunches. I went to pick them up and was given 15-20 minutes notice that my order was ready. When I got there, I found that my order had been overcooked and that some of the lunch items had run out of stock. When I asked why my order was not fresh, the manager told me that it was because the kitchen had closed. I told her that the kitchen was open and that she had two other customers waiting for their orders. She said that they were being slow and I could have waited if I had known that my order was going to take so long. I asked her why they were being slow and she said that they were preparing a new meal. I told her that she had plenty of time to prepare my order, but she told me that she had been waiting on other orders. I asked her if she would give me a refund for the overcooked food. She refused and said that she would give me a small discount for the inconvenience. When I got home, I found that the two items I received were not hot and that the portions were extremely small. I returned the items to the store and asked for a refund. The manager refused to refund the money, so I filed a complaint. I hope that they will address this issue with the kitchen. I will not be returning to this location. Thank you. Have you ever had a bad experience at a Walmart Supercenter? If so, share your story in the comments section below.

This is not the first time I have had a problem with this location. I have also noticed that the quality of the food has gone down. I used to love getting their food, but now I am not so sure. I will not be returning to this location again. The staff is also very unfriendly and rude. The last time I was there, the staff member at the counter was very short with me and did not seem happy to be helping me. I am very disappointed in this location and will not be returning."
Tsinghua,yelp-5,"Verve Vegas is our church home, and has been for about a year. Verve is an incredible church- very casual atmosphere, and come as you are attitude. You will never see the pastors around, and it is not about you being perfect, but more about your relationship with Christ. They have a good amount of musical talent, and really have a love for the Lord. This is a church where the people are friendly, and willing to help you. Praise God, we found Verve. 10.0out of 10.0 Pros: Verve is an amazing church that is truly filled with God. They have amazing musicians, but also encourage the congregation to be active in their worship. The people are amazing. They are loving, kind, and willing to help you. The message is very important to them. They will not allow their message to be cut short by ""oh I have to go do this"" or ""I have to go do that.""

Eleuther-AI,yelp-5,"Verve Vegas is our church home, and has been for about a year. Verve is an incredible church- very casual atmosphere, and come as you are attitude. You will never feel out of place at any service there! The youth group meets once per week in the evening (usually on Monday nights). The kids have fun games to play during that time; such things like Operation Mission Impossible where they visit different parts around town with their mission cards telling them what needs assistance from military veterans - ie: helper card says ""gum,"" let's go find some gum!! Or we do missions outside trips which can include going bowling or playing laser tag...or sometimes just hanging inside having snacks together:) We also meet Sunday mornings before worship starts 9am downstairs w coffee juice so its really great way get connected if your new too!!!:) Sunday School classes begin after Morning Worship ends each weekend but then it goes into separate rooms depending upon grade level class being offered..there r 2 options: (1) 3rd through 6th graders start off running upstairs right away whereas 7 thru 12 join us down stairs. (2), last option students may sit wherever space allows throughout main floor area when available.We hope this helps answer questions!"

You will never see a suit and tie at this church- unless you are in leadership (and that's a different story). This church is full of people who are genuine, passionate about Jesus, and fun. That's why we love it. There is no pretense, and the church is full of people who love God and love people. Verve has a 'battle cry' of sorts, and it is 'love God, love people, and live free'. The 'live free' part is what stuck out to me the most. I never want to take my freedom for granted. I never want to forget the sacrifice made on my behalf. I never want to live in a way that is displeasing to God. I want to live free. Live free to love others. Live free to be who God created me to be. Live free to share the gospel. Live free to make disciples. Live free to make a difference. Live free to be a voice. Live free to be who God created me to be. Live free to live in the moment. Live free to be imperfect. Live free to be authentic. Live free to have a relationship with God. Live free to live life to the fullest. 'I will live like a man in awe of God.

This could be a common issue with the plumbing or water heater system, and unfortunately, there may not be an immediate solution. However, you can try contacting the hotel management or maintenance team to see if they can investigate the issue and make any necessary repairs or adjustments.

The hotel was in a great location, the staff were friendly and the room was comfortable. A microwave and fridge in every room.

The breakfast room is very small with just 2 tables at 1 end of what looks like an eating area that doubles as storage. There are no seats or even any chairs available except those used during busy times so finding anywhere near your table can prove difficult (although this did not stop us from getting served within 20 minutes after we arrived). The buffet selection poor compared too other hotels ive stayed... only basic cereals breads, yoghurts etc.. really?? And you pay more per day then some 4 each time?? We also ate out every night including our evening meal when staying here which again felt overpriced considering how average everything else food wise seemed...... overall service good but inconsistent quality all round....."

The person trying to help us on the phone never answered back after we asked if she understood our problem. Aren't they supposed to be able to speak English? We went up to the restaurant area for lunch 4 times no one ever called to see how long it took! My friend got upset because he waited 30 minutes for someone to come out to take his check (he ordered 2 different items). When finally it did arrive some guy who looked like an Italian lady ran past him to get her paperwork done. Needless to say I don't recommend staying here! The location is really good, close to Disney and all the restaurants are within walking distance too. The only thing i have against them is their WiFi wasn't working well. Other than that it's great Good Staff Great Value For Money Soaking Tub and Decking Suites were spacious. Walking Distance To Walt Disney World Resort"

PaLM,yelp-7,I am mad that I had to give this place even 1 star. See the old reviews were pretty good then the newer reviews are mostly bad. This place changed for the worse. I went here for the first time and was very excited to try it out because of the great reviews. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was bland and dry. I was very disappointed. The service was also very slow. I waited over an hour for my food to come out and it was not even that busy. I will not be returning to this place again.
LLAMA,yelp-7,I am mad that ha had to give this place even 1 star. See the old reviews were pretty good then the newer reviews are mostly bad. This place changed hands and management as of January 2019. The people that took it over have no business running a nursing home. They have fired every great employee and the place is run by kids. They do not even have one nurse on the floor on the weekends. They only have 2 people to do the whole nursing home. The nurses are way understaffed and can't give the care they need to. The food is terrible and they do not give them good food like they used to. The residents are not getting their meds or their meals. The owner doesn't even care about the residents he just wants the money. They are not licensed for dementia and they are admitting people with it. They have no transportation for the residents. They need to close this place down and give it back to the people that knew how to run it. The owner is rude and insults residents and their families. The staff is lazy and uncaring. The food is terrible. The nurses don't care and never answer their phones. It's a terrible place.

This place changed hands and they have done a terrible job with it! The last guy who was here did not follow through on promises he made, which in turn caused me an issue (which we will talk about later). I ordered banana pancakes for breakfast and when I got there no bananas available so next time I would order them without bananas or vice versa. It's situated right over the interstate but is surrounded by trees giving you privacy from traffic noise The owner said the best way to get into town was Uber or Lyft, however m y friend requested Uber only because she didn't want to wait all day waiting for us and her car wasn't ready yet. She thought the driver might be hungry after long trips and offered him some food before picking up the rest of our luggage. He politely declined saying he's very busy driving people around. We ended up walking down 2 blocks to the train station which took 20 minutes. We stayed at Union Station one night as part of my birthday weekend trip since I wanted to try out both Portland's two finest cities: Kamiah and Seattle. As usual, staying near the airport makes sense if you're taking planes home and looking forward to getting off the plane early enough to enjoy your free time! We organized everything ourselves especially how far each destination needed to be reached using public transit andor shuttle buses services like that connecting downtown Vancouver Airport Downtown Vancouver. The other option is having someone else pick you up once you've moved onto their schedule from different locations within Canada or USA. As expected, that's what we chose instead - we asked our friends in Victoria, BC and San Francisco respectively to drive us as well! It worked quite seamlessly considering they shared many similar routes between these 3 places including Vancouver, Whitecourt, Richmond, Burnaby, North Delta etc. All of the drivers gave full directions regarding where they'd drop us off first - generally outside any particular neighbourhoodarea or along major roads to ensure we'd be able to easily reach certain destinations while keeping eye contact with fellow passengers during longer journeys."

This place changed I'm sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with the business in question. It is always disappointing to see previously positive reviews turn negative. It is possible that the business has gone through some changes that affected the quality of their service or products. However, it is also possible that the newer negative reviews are outliers, and that the business is still generally good. If you feel strongly about leaving a review, I would encourage you to share your honest thoughts and experiences, both positive and negative. This can help other people make informed decisions when choosing whether to patronize the business."
Tsinghua,yelp-7,"I am mad that ha had to give this place even 1 star. See the old reviews were pretty good then the newer reviews are mostly bad. This place changed over the years and they are not a good place to go. There is nothing good to eat here. Extremely bad service. Asked for a free appetizer for the table and when we got there the waitress was gone and the manager was talking to another table. Asked for a sandwich and they charged us for it and we never got it. It's not the food or the prices, but the service and how they treat their customers. So if you go here, you better bring cash. There is no way to get a good meal for 20 or less. You are going to get ripped off, over charged, or get scolded. Go to one of the many other local restaurants for a good meal for less. Worst restaurant in the world, my wife and I had the same experience at this restaurant. I had the calamari and it was like chewing on plastic. I would never go back. The salad dressing was awful and the calamari was rubbery. The service was poor, they didn't even say hi to us, and the food was horrible. This was the worst food I've ever had in my life. I've been to all the best restaurants in the world, but this was the worst I've ever had. The calamari was inedible. The only good thing about this restaurant was the people who work there.

Human,yelp-7,I am mad that ha had to give this place even 1 star. See the old reviews were pretty good then the newer reviews are mostly bad. This place changed ownership and the new management is rude. The food isnt the same. Its very bad actually. I used to call in and order take out when I was in town about 2-3 times per week. I called right after they changed hands. The woman on the phone said she didnt know what I was talking about and hung up on me. I was confused. I went there and figured there was a miscommunication but it was all new staff. I ordered any way. The food was different. I was treated like I was not welcome. I thought I would complain to the new owner. I was dealing with the new owner all along! DONT GO HERE. Their food isnt fit for dogs and they have such bad attitudes.

Every time I go in there to get my car washed they do a fantastic job. The team is very friendly and they do a great job. The staff at the Valparaiso location are always pleasant and go above and beyond! They have taken care of my vehicle for the past 3 years and I will continue to bring my car here! The carwash wash was fine, but the young man who had to take my coupon and the cash had a very bad attitude. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but my husband and I both noticed it. EVERYTHING WAS GOOD EXCEPT THEY DID NOT VACUUM OUT MY CAR. I didn't realize how dirty my car was until I got it back. Now it's clean, inside and out! The people were very nice and friendly. The car wash is always great. I have been going there for many years. Excellent service, was extremely happy with the work done. Everyone was so nice and helpful. You can tell they care about their customers! Oil change was done in a timely manner and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I enjoy coming here because they remember me when I come in and that makes me feel appreciated. They are very polite and courteous and I just love going here!"

My 6 year old nephew also has asthma we use an inhaler most days for short periods when he's got symptoms it's been very helpful but we don't have access to medication as our insurance doesn't cover anything related to breathing problems. We just can't afford it which isn't fair considering how much money we're spending feeing my grandson everyday for several hours per day while at school (if only they could put some sort of limit up). Maybe they need to consider making them available to anyone with asthma regardless of whether they're covered by medical care. I'm sorry, I'm really sad about what you're going through. My husband's father had lung cancer and died last week after coming home to us. He's a fighter all his life and would never let himself give up. In fact, he was having trouble sleeping because he didn't know how long he had left. He'd wake up early every morning thinking ""oh no, I've only slept six hours"" and then try again until finally God took him off his feet."
Tsinghua,yelp-8,"I gather from Jaime who works here that they are hurting and they brought him in to stop giving things away. Now they charge 2 for a squirt of air. If you want more than one, you can have a free 20 minute session. But you can't come back to get more later on. You have to pay for the whole thing. Not sure if it's worth it, but I went in with a pretty big wad of cash in my pocket and spent about 40. My dad, who is a CPA, was very good at telling me where to put my money. : ( When you are done with your air, just run over to the next place on your way home. You can get a squirt of squeezable air, and get a freebie out of it. I got a bunch of air for free when I was there on Monday."

We came to the D to play the quarter horse race game and stopped at the D Grill for lunch. We wound up having breakfast instead. I had the Cowboy, which is country fried steak with with gravy along with two eggs and Texas toast. The toast is served under the steak, but I would prefer to have it on the side. Wife had two eggs with ham and toast. Along with the toast they provide homemade strawberry preserves which are awesome. Service was good and the food was good as well."

With kind of a fifties diner decor and menu, it has the perfect atmosphere for people watching and enjoying the bar scene. This is where most of the action happens, so you'll probably be eating and drinking there. If you don't want to eat here, though, there's a full menu of fast food and other eats at the main casino, which is a short walk away. Shopping: There are several shops at the casino, but most of them are for the casino staff, not for customers. The casino does have a 24-hour store, but if you're in the mood for a nice latte, or something for dinner, head to the other side of the casino and you'll find a few restaurants. The casino also has a Starbucks, and a 24-hour drugstore and newsstand. Sports: There are a couple of gaming tables, a poker room, and a pool table in the casino. Entertainment: The casino has a few bars, including the Bar D, where there are often live bands. There's also a bowling alley in the basement of the casino. Information: The main casino information desk is at the 1st floor, in the center of the casino, where you'll find a payphone and a bank of pay machines.

I love going here because the food is always fresh and good, the service is super friendly, and the atmosphere is lively and fun. There is something for everyone here. Amazing food. Great selection of food for everyone. Drinks are amazing. Great service. Will definitely go back. Get quick answers from Kona Grill - Louisville staff and past visitors. Do they accept gift cards from the one in Charlotte, NC? I don't think so. We bought a gift card at the Kona in Portland, Or last year and it didn't work at the one in Louisville. Do you offer gluten free menu items? Do they have crab legs? I was in Louisville for a work conference. My husband and I met up with family and went to dinner here.

We have gone there several times and it is one of our favorites. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal. We've had the miso skewers, chow mein, crab legs, and the fish. All of the dishes were delicious. Macondo is located on the edge of town and not the easiest place to find. However, the staff is very friendly and attentive. It's a great place to get a bite to eat, especially on a cold winter night. The miso skewers are the best. Macondo is an easy, pleasant drive from Portland, or even Seattle. A lot of people come to visit the village, but not enough stop at this place. We've had the rice, the miso, the pork, the fried rice, and the scallops. Each is a winner. If you're not hungry, you won't be, so order as much as you can. I've been here several times, and it is my favorite spot in the village.

I got a watermelon juice, it wasn't as good as usual; I would have preferred some type of drink that fit my taste more like a Smoothie or Frappuccino (which is here) but no variety offered at all The food was very poor quality overall. This place isn't worth visiting twice. It's overpriced and too expensive. We really enjoyed our dining experience here today! We ordered three courses. Our server was extremely attentive throughout our meal which included wine pairings. Her recommendations made us feel welcomed into this fine establishment. She helped us choose dishes we both liked while making sure they matched our preferences!

EVERY table outside has been taken before 8pm and already by 9:30p the restaurant was nearly empty, except for one couple seated out front.

BigScience,yelp-16,"I am a VrtuCar customer that made the mistake of sharing a car through this company when I made a trip to Montreal from Ottawa. I just got off of my plane, was handed over an extremely dirty car and asked where did you get it? When i said vroom!!! He mentioned he is not responsible for cleaning cars left behind in his parking lot after pick up by customers leaving their cars there on long trips like mine causing them foggy windows!! (the only thing worse than driving your own messed up vehicle). LOL! This location should be ashamed of themselves! I'm so angry about this accident happen on February 6. 2019 at 9:20 PM. I have rented a Cars with VRUTCAR since January 12.2019,we are located near buxton mall Toronto Ontario Canada. My friend also has been renting cars with vrutcar on the same day as me. The driver who picked us both up called the wrong number because we were using cell phones..according to him he didn't hear important parts of our conversation,so he decided to take a look inside my bag which contained all of my phone used items as well some cash. My wallet had no money but was full of cards that can be ran if needed. I told her sorry I'm fine thanks she replied you're lucky even though I know it's quite risky carrying enough money..soon enough the guy comes to pick us back up..he wasn't very happy or friendly towards my friend. As soon as he gets out of the car he tells my friends that's why he's taking care of us and we're paying for his time....what does that mean?? That means he's being unprofessional? We explained everything clearly to him. If anything goes wrong on a ride with him then we'll give him feedback again....she replies don't worry about reviews,or something else...yes yes please whatever yall want...when we finally arrived home they're going to check into VRUT CAR's app and see what happened,my friend texted me ok they found it, and basically apologized for getting mad saying that now they realize how much people trust things online and think everyone knows everything..we've never met them before nor will ever do because there's too many bad stories already posted..they're pretty good trying to right any comments that were put here regarding their service. They can't send pictures either yet. Anyway says she's calling later today after meeting someone from HR. Is it possible to cancel within 3 hours? Because I booked 2 days ago... I'm scared I don't need to use this place anymore... We purchased two vehicles last week, one van and one truck. Our payment method matched. However, upon receiving confirmation emails stating delivery date, pickup times etc., we received multiple messages asking for additional information including contact numbers during business hours. We contacted support several times via emailphone confirmingrefusing these requests prior to ordering. After attempting multiple communications, they eventually sent out a second order confirmation. Upon viewing the details, we noticed that ""transfer fees"" were added to the original estimated cost based on incorrect prices presented on site. On Thursday morning, a representative reached out to support requesting more communication channels. Within minutes of sending them consecutive feedback responses, another call came in. Support agents attempted to reach out via chat, but couldn't communicate properly due to lack of English skills. Eventually, representatives decided to leave voice messages. Finally, once we'd completed our final question, our calls went directly to voicemail instead. A couple weeks earlier, we tried ordering vantruck without having to fill out credit card form everytime. We discovered it's impossible to add new devices while still adding existing ones... I've provided feedback already on other occasions regarding problems I've encountered while utilizing VRUTCAR's services. These experiences range from faulty GPS units to low battery life issues. Last Friday I was charged 40 for a rental item that didn't arrive until Saturday afternoon. Manager hung up on me twice telling me that he would refund the 20 difference between total price and actual amount paid offered to compensate with a few dollars as compensation rather than providing refunds. Throughout the entire process, I repeatedly stated my disapproval and continued reiterating my position that I was entitled to a complete refund. When confronted with the fact that he refused to provide the requested cooperation, I expressed frustration, noting the poor quality equipment in general and specifically whether the GPS unit functioned correctly. In response, he quickly dismissed my concerns assured me that there would be little problem with functionality despite previous complaints. While agreeing to overlook past incidents, I noted the limited timeframe available to resolve the matter considering the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic. Given the current circumstances, he informed me personally that it might take 1-2 business days pending verification via Telecheck. Despite knowing that fully functioning GPS system is essential to coordinating safe deliveries in difficult weather conditions, I acknowledged that such delays may compromise safety issues furthermore threatening the reliability of upcoming bookings as well. Instead of pursuing resolution options as promised, he simply insisted that I pay for the conveyance regardless given that my situation differed significantly compared to others. Ultimately, I reluctantly accepted the offer and proceeded with transaction. At least 10 minutes after"

I drove the car back to Ottawa and when I got there, I took it to a mechanic. The mechanic told me that the tires were so worn out that they were a safety hazard. He also said that the car had been in an accident and that it had been repaired poorly.

I just got off of the phone with a customer service rep who was trying to help me get my money back for a week of inconvenience and indignity. It is unfortunate that this company is not run by professional people. They did not take care of me or my credit card (Visa). They made me pay a 20 fee for each day I was not in Montreal. They have now disconnected my account and are refusing to refund me the 300 I spent. They made me pay the full amount even though I only had a 100 credit on my account. I had to call them three times to make them take down my account and refund me the money. This is not a company that is run by professional people. They are more concerned about making a quick buck and making sure their investors don't find out about this mess. I will not recommend this company to anyone.

I just got off of the phone with Communauto rep and I am very disgruntled. I booked the car though the VrtuCar website, so I assumed that everything would be paid through my VrtuCar account. This was not the case. I did not receive anything in the mail telling me to pay a Communauto bill, so I didn't think about it again until I went to log in today to book a car and am now kicked out of my account. I use this for work and needed to book it for a last-minute meeting. When I called VrtuCar, I was told to contact Communauto, which I did, and asked them if I could pay my bill over the phone. They don't do this. They told me to log in to my online banking (assuming I had this in the first place) and to pay online. I did and couldn't find them as a payee at first because they did not give me their full name to use (Inc.) I asked them if there was any other method of payment and the guy very rudely said Well, maybe you should just go into your bank and pay there! I eventually was able to see the error and found them listed, but they were very rude and very unhelpful. What a scam. I will NEVER be booking Communauto again. Their customer service is terrible.

I also received a speeding ticket while I had the car which I paid for.

Human,yelp-17,"You'd think, wouldn't you, that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views? Not so, it's in a typical strip mall off Warner Rd. and unfortunately its patio faces directly on the street, making it hard to carry on a conversation, even on a Sunday. The patio, without misters, is uninviting, with a very odd mixture of seat cushions for the wrought iron furniture. It was even more off-putting because most of the tables were loaded with dirty dishes. There was one hard working busboy who couldn't keep up with the mess. It wasn't much better indoors - messy and noisy (the noise of the cars being replaced by very loud music). You place your order at the counter. Breakfast is served daily from 6:30 AM to 4 PM. There are pancakes, plain or with apple compote (6) or with bananas, caramel, creme fraiche and peanuts (7). Eggs, scrambled or fried, come with MJ toast and a choice of bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo (6). Various egg sandwiches and omelets range from 6 to 8. But we had come for lunch. The selection was small, and not particularly inspiring. Tuna or chicken salad sandwiches (7), turkey (6), a BLT to which you could add a fried egg at no extra charge (7) and a croque monsieur (7.50). Surprisingly, none of these came with a side. The cheeseburger (8.50) came with fries. I ordered the rotisserie half chicken (10) which was served with fries and seasonal local vegetables. Of course, I requested crispy fries. Ken opted for the Derby Salad, with various greens, egg, avocado, bacon, and blue cheese, served with house made buttermilk dressing (8). We waited quite a while, when finally a server, shouting our name and number, delivered our food. The salad was good size, with loads of blue cheese chunks of good quality (rather than the generic crumbles served at many places), and large pieces of bacon. The greens were fresh and the avocado looked freshly cubed. It's a shame that the buttermilk dressing was tasteless, and the quantity skimpy. My chicken was nicely cooked, with crisp skin - much crispier, in fact, than my fries which were dark brown, but limp. The vegetables were a mix of roasted cauliflowerets, corn, and red peppers which I enjoyed. We took home a brownie and a slice of chocolate cake. Both were excellent. All in all, although our food was generally good, I had expected more. More ambience, a nicer setting, a more interesting menu. One of the owners of Hillside Spot also owns Gallo Blanco, a SouthwesternMexican restaurant (our favorite) in the Clarendon Hotel in downtown Phoenix,. That menu, while small, is full of interesting, flavorful food. The place is clean, the decor bus station funky. It is, however, LOUD, especially when the Flamenco dancers are in attendance. Unfortunately, the limp fries are there too. So, while we will continue to eat at Gallo Blanco, Hillside Spot is off limits for us."

BigScience,yelp-17,"You'd think, wouldn't you, that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views? Not so, it's in a noisy mall. So here's my take on the place: When I arrived the line was long but not for the remote waiter who asked me where we were going and then told us to sit down even though there weren't any tables available. The first thing he saw when he came up behind us - no matter how many times they have been cleaned by our server or myself - is still left unattended (no soap bar); the dirty towels are strewn across the table between two people; the paper napkins aren't folded properly and at one point during the course of dinner only half of them had been used because evidently whoever served us didn't bother to do it after every single meal. With drinks coming out promptly and prompting conversation from others out front, most likely customers as well, putting a smile on the face of anyone in waiting area made me glad we chose Hillside spot over other restaurants around town that make everyone feel unwelcome. Our food items included ribs, seafood, wings more. The appetizer featured crispy calamari stuffed with shrimps and crab meat glazed within bite-sized portions that paired perfectly with an orange juice which tasted good too. This dish definitely hit the spot! Next comes another entree featuring beefy chunks of ribeye cooked medium rare with fluffy mashed potatoes topped off with black beans and spinach salad...Mmmmmm! Loved it!!! My husband ordered the Long Island Steak Sandwich - tender patty covered in melted cheese grilled to perfection and marinated with red wine sauce. Love love loved it!! We both enjoyed the Japanese Hot Pot priced at 16.95 each, which included chicken breast fillets, scallops, pork belly sizzling deep fried with vegetables tossed in light soy broth. And last but certainly NOT least desserts: Crispy chocolate chip cookies smothered in hot fudge brownie layered in vanilla ice cream. Yummo!!!"

It's a lovely strip mall, however, and it's surrounded by some pretty spacious parking lots. I tried to find a menu online before we went, but it wasn't to be found. I did find a review from a year ago that said the restaurant had changed ownership and the food was great. We decided to take a chance. The menu is a wide variety of mostly American dishes. I ordered a French dip sandwich and my companion ordered the Southwest burger. They were both good, but not remarkable. The prices are a little on the high side for what you get. I had a small side salad for 3.50 and it was miniscule. I will say that the service was very good. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Would I go again? Maybe. I'd like to see if the menu has changed, but I'm not anxious to go back. If you'd like to see the Hillside Spot restaurant, you can find it at 4820 E. Warner Road in Ahwatukee."

Not so, it's in a strip mall near an intersection. If the place looked anything at all picturesque I might feel more inclined to use one of my table reservations - but alas! The exterior is aggressively bland and nondescript; no hint whatsoever as how good your meal may taste within those walls: The menu itself looks tempting enough (if only for their homemade salsa verde), though not nearly original or creative-enough priced (9 - 16 entrees). It's billed ""New American,"" offering influences from around southwestern UsaMexico border lands where they have locations across Arizona New Mexico - plus maybe some influence seeping onto our northern rim if there was any chance we could get them up here:) We found plenty else on which people will salivate over while waiting patiently behind us... including these two plates just left by locals who came back again after ordering takeout later..

When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside. 10mn? Not a problem!, I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area. And we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait.

I wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the we paid. They brought the perfunctory amuse gueule, which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug.... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit. At this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle.... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife. They then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting..... (but come on,.... how hard is it to screw up bread??). We perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white).... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving.... which was a plus... As a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras.... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better).... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread.... quite nice.... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders. My wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte.... one piece of advice.... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder, with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese..... For 11, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success.... however, he did later take it off the bill. My wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy. What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy..... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries.... yuck. I however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. No dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience. Netnet: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide...."

We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this restaurant based off of the pictures online... Wow! What an awful experience it turned out being!! The food tasted AWFUL!!! When our server came back after we ordered appetizers he said ""Oh man you guys are gonna love these scallops!"" as if they taste great right? Wrong!!!! So 2 hours later when she brought them over (after telling us numerous times that there would be no more than 15 minutes before things got done) nothing could have killed how bad those SCALLOPS TASTED!!!!!!!!! )! Had 3 different people order their own meal from other tables while mine sat waiting.............sorry but someone needs fired or at least put through some serious training because obviously NO ONE has trained her properly considering SHE WAS THE ONLY STAFF MEMBER WE SAW ALL EVENING THAT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THEY WERE HAVIN ANY FUN AT WORK EITHER!!.. SOMETHINGS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE...... AND IT GETS WORSE AFTER DESSERT COMES AROUND FOR OUR TABLE......YOU START TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU ARE GONNA SPEND ON BOTH OF YOUR MEALS WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE IS PAYING 100's IN COSTUMERS SO WHAT DO YOu EXPECT?????!??? That is just what happens with cheaper places like Chili'n Crackers all across America................and now your left wondering why did u pay 50 bucks per person up front not knowing WHICH WAY UR FATE WILL GO??? This place rates 3 below chili n cracker...that should tell yall something................................HORRIBLE SERVICE PLEASE AVOID"
Tsinghua,yelp-18,"I must say.... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place for dinner. Needless to say, I was disappointed with the meal. We ordered 2 appetizers (Tuna tataki and Mango papaya salad), 2 entrees (Broccoli slaw with lamb and Seared scallops), and a desert (chocolate ganache). My husband and I have a rule when we go out for dinner, that we don't overeat, and we do eat light, but not so light that we're hungry for the next meal. That was our plan for dinner, and we were satisfied with what we ordered. However, the service was awful, and I have never experienced that before. The server kept apologizing for being so late, and we kept telling her we didn't mind waiting. However, the food was not that great, and we had to ask for it to be reheated twice, and they didn't even apologize for that. I don't understand why they're so sorry for being late, and not sorry for how the food was. The service was so bad that we almost walked out, and my husband had to calm me down. The only good thing that happened was that we got a discount, which was nice. If you are going to a restaurant, order what you want, and don't expect a free meal. 0 by akapib on Jan 24, 20142Q: Any word on the cancellation of the new project at Frontera Grill? - - Review by 1Q: Any word on the cancellation of the new project at Frontera Grill? - - Review by 1Q No. No word on the cancellation of the new project at Frontera Grill. 0 by JoseM66 on Nov 18, 20132Q: Frontera Grill - Costa Mesa CA - 92013 - Review by JoseM66 Frontera Grill - Costa Mesa CA - 92013 - Review by JoseM66 The staff was very nice and the food was good.

LLAMA,yelp-18,"I must say.... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this restaurant since it was a must try restaurant on my list of foodie places in the Valley. I love tapas, and this was supposed to be an awesome spot. But.... we were not impressed. The food was not bad, but it was not as good as we were expecting. The service was very poor. The hostess was nice, and the waitress was nice but did not have a clue about any of the food and drink. We were served a beer that was not on the menu, and when we questioned it, the waitress did not know anything about it. She had to go ask her manager about it. The service was slow, and the waitress was too busy talking to the other wait staff. We waited a long time for our bill. To start, we had the Manchego con Membrillo, a spreadable cheese with a quince paste. It was pretty good and came with some crusty bread to spread it on. It was a good starter. Next, we had the Papas Bravas, which is potatoes. It was the normal potato with a little tomato sauce. The sauce was good, but the potatoes were overcooked. The Bocadillo de Huevo was a deviled egg with some fried jamon and roasted red pepper. It was pretty good. I am not a fan of deviled eggs, but these were good. Next we had the Bravas de Carne, which is a spicy beef slider. The meat was good and the sauce was great. The bun was a little dry, but it was still pretty good. The next dish we had was the Shrimp Croquettes, which were amazing. The outside was crunchy, and the inside was hot and gooey. It was topped with a spicy tomato sauce. The sauce was amazing. The dish was so good. The last dish we had was the Gazpacho de Coco, which is a coconut gazpacho. It was really good. It had a lot of flavor and was refreshing. I would definitely order this again. Overall, the food was not as good as we expected. It was not bad, but it was just ok. The service was really bad. The waitress was not very attentive. She was too busy talking to the other wait staff. She was very slow to bring us our bill. I was very disappointed in the food. I was expecting a lot more."

When you are out of the country, especially with family members, it can be difficult to find a doctor who is trusted and competent. I was lucky enough to have a very good doctor in New Zealand but she is now back in Australia and I needed to find another gynaecologist. After a few months of searching, I found my new GP, Dr D. She is brilliant and really listened to my concerns and needs. She is caring and very professional. She really cares about my health and that of my baby. Her professionalism has meant I don't have to worry about anything other than the health of my baby and myself. She is always prompt and friendly and I would recommend her to anyone. In the last year I have gone to Dr D's office on three occasions. The first was for an ultrasound to check on the health of my baby. This was painless and reassuring. The second time I was referred to Dr D to have a blood test to check my levels of folic acid. This was a very thorough and detailed test and was helpful in determining whether I needed to take folic acid supplements. I was asked to return for a blood test and ultrasound in a month's time. At the time I was concerned about the blood test and ultrasound. I was told by Dr D that it was a routine blood test and that she would take the time to explain the results to me in detail. She has been absolutely right. The ultrasound was a reassuring check that I had not been affected by the MMR vaccine and I was reassured that the baby was developing well. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr D to anyone who is considering a doctor in New Zealand. My experience of working with Dr D was great. I needed to have a scan done to ensure the baby was developing well and that there were no issues. Dr D was extremely professional and thorough in her approach. I was left feeling completely reassured that everything was okay. Dr D has a great bedside manner and is very personable. I would not hesitate to recommend her to others. I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant and I've been seeing Dr D since my 16 week scan. I was referred to Dr D after a long discussion with my GP about my fears about having a baby. She is very reassuring and helpful and always provides thorough explanations and listens to my concerns. I am very happy with her and I would recommend her to anyone. I saw Dr D for the first time at my 16 week scan. I was so impressed with her and the experience of having a scan with her. She was so professional and thorough and really listened to my concerns and explained everything in detail. I felt so comfortable and relaxed with her and would recommend her to anyone. I've been seeing Dr D for over a year now. I was referred to her after a discussion with my GP about my concerns about having a baby.

After all, we are talking about our lady parts here, and they are important. I want to share with you my experience with my first GYN visit at Virtua and share my thoughts on why you should come here for your first GYN visit too! Its an awkward subject for me because it's not something I talk about, but I want to share this because I know you don't want to feel uncomfortable or insecure. My first GYN visit was scary and embarrassing. I was 18 and didn't know what to expect. No one tells you what to expect because they expect you to just ""know."" I didn't know and I was nervous. I ended up going to a general practitioner and they had me lie back on an exam table and proceeded to ask me if I was sexually active. I said no and they asked me to spread my legs, and thats when I was like ""uhhhh.. this is not what I expected"" and then it got weird when they started poking around, trying to look inside my vagina with a flashlight. It was traumatizing and horrible. It wasn't what I expected, and I just wanted to get the heck out of there. I didn't like how they talked to me or treated me, and I was left feeling even more confused. This was not the experience I was hoping to have. I wish I had known then what I know now. After hearing so many good things about Virtua, and having an amazing experience with my first visit at Virtua Primary Care, I was so excited to get to see what it was like to have my first GYN visit at Virtua. I had the opportunity to go to Virtua Health Wellness in Washington Township in Washington Township NJ. I was so impressed with the beautiful facility and welcoming staff. They put me at ease right away. I wasn't sure what to expect, but when I was called back to the exam room I was pleasantly surprised. The room was warm, inviting and had a giant tub in the room that I thought was so cool. My nurse was super kind, and talked to me about the whole process of what was going to happen, which really helped me feel more comfortable. I was so nervous but I didn't have to be. My nurse was amazing and made me feel at ease. She answered all my questions, and did a wonderful job explaining the process and what she was going to do. It was really nice having someone answer all my questions and be so kind and understanding. I don't think I can stress how important this is when you are getting a GYN exam. You want to feel comfortable, and know what is going on, and you want to feel like you can talk to the person giving you the exam. When my GYN came in she was so nice and understanding. She took the time to ask me how I was feeling and what questions I had. It was so nice having someone who was so professional, kind and caring. She was understanding and gentle with me. This is so important because no one wants to have a GYN exam that is uncomfortable and unpleasant. I was so impressed with my experience and I know you will be too. I am so excited to partner with Virtua and share my experience with you. I want you to feel comfortable and have a great experience too. I want to help ease the anxiety you might be feeling and share my experience. I would love to hear from you and what your first GYN experience was like, or what questions you have. Let me know in the comments below. "" 6 Cool Gadgets for your Kitchen My 2018 Fall Bucket List "" What a great post, and I'm so happy you had a good experience!!

I am so happy to hear that, I hope you have an amazing experience too! I am so happy you had such a wonderful experience! I have had a few and they are always so different but this one sounds amazing! Thank you so much! I am so happy to hear that. I'm glad you had such a great experience!

Human,yelp-19,"Lets face it, no one wants to write a review about her vagina getting checked (TMI anyone?) but as women we need to find places we can rely and trust for all our Gyno needs. This is just my small contribution to it. I was in a situation where I needed to see a specialist and I didn't know of any in the area. My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test). I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr. The office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my IDinsurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure.... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?. I quickly lifted up my pants and ran to the desk to try and convince them to let me give my urine sample right away, before I exploded. I gave my sample but was really grossed out that they gave me a coffee-looking paper cup. Below those cups they actually had the plastic sample containers with a lid, but they insisted I use the regular paper (NO LID) cup and put it in the deposit box. Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor. When he finally arrived, the procedure literally took 2 mins and I was out the door by then. Not sure why I had to wait 1.5hrs for that but oh well. I didn't feel like the office was very organized or patient-focused. It bothered me that all consultation rooms had flat screen TVs with drug advertisements, to try and entice you to ask your doctor about that. It gives me the impression that they are in the business of selling unnecessary medication and ad space rather than patient care. No, I don't wan to discus how I can gulf down a bunch of pills so that my period smells like flowers and unicorns. I just want to be healthy. Wait... is that too much to ask?"
OpenAI,yelp-20,"Flying with any airline can be painful, as many reviews indicate. Over the last ten years of nearly weekly travel I have come to know many of the Phoenix employee's It's understandable that flying can be a difficult experience for some people, especially if they are frequent travelers. It's important to remember that airline employees are also dealing with the stresses of the job, including long hours, irate customers, and weather delays. However, building strong relationships with airline staff, such as those in Phoenix, can help make the experience more pleasant. Kindness and empathy can go a long way in making everyone's day a little bit easier.

As far has going through security lines go; not all airports are like LAX where there is enough staff for just about every one who goes thru screening at least once an hour which does make things slow up...especially when they put everyone on hold while checking something out in Washington DC., but nevermind how much time someone spends waiting because mostly everything gets checked even though sometimes passengers still complain ""why do we always get stopped!"" It makes me wonder what people think happens during those stops? Are these supposed travelers too stupid after having taken off nenses from sitting 7-8 hours before landing forgetting maybe leaving half naked behind them someplace along this journey?? But wait..even more than silly rants against TSA agents being overzealous spending precious minutes looking into bags finding nothing other then personal items left laying open by sloppy packing idiots may drive home - why would anyone expect anything different given our track record here lately?.

That said, I have also met employees who had attitude issues, could care less about service and were working only for the paycheck. From my experience, there are two reasons to do business with an airline. One is price and the other is the people. The only way to get the people you want is to support the airline. If you do not support the airline, it will go away. If you do not support the airline, you will have no choice of airlines. You may or may not get the best price, but you will get the people you deserve. Great airline. I have flown many times on this airline and the flight attendants are always polite and helpful. The airline itself is great and is very convenient when flying out of the twin cities. I would recommend this airline to anyone flying to the twin cities. Cons: No entertainment. One hour delay. Cons: The seats were super tiny and not comfortable at all. I also thought the plane had a really strong smell to it. Pros: Nothing. I am no longer loyal to Delta. Cons: Everything about this flight was uncomfortable. I'm 5'10"" and 195 pounds. I don't normally have a problem with leg room. This flight was the exception. I felt like a sardine in a can.

My travel experience has been much better than with many other airlines, but this is based on the fact that I have flown on many different aircraft types, and often in different countries. I have always been treated courteously and respectfully by Phoenix employees. The check-in staff are particularly courteous, and the friendly and helpful attendants in the lounge are a delight. I find that the Phoenix flight crew is also the most pleasant I have ever experienced. The cabin crew members are all extremely friendly and attentive, and I have never experienced an instance of rudeness. The Phoenix flight engineers are among the best I have ever encountered. I have never seen them behave in an unprofessional manner, and they are always polite and courteous. They always do a good job of preparing the aircraft for flight, and I have never seen a Phoenix aircraft out of condition. The Phoenix maintenance folks are a cut above, too. I have always received excellent service from them, and they always have a smile and a kind word. I have never seen Phoenix do anything to embarrass me. Phoenix is a very special airline. I'm proud to fly with them. I travel frequently on Phoenix Airlines, and the flight crews are consistently courteous and friendly. I've never had a flight attendant behave in a rude manner, and they're always quick to help. Phoenix is the only airline I've ever flown that's willing to let me choose my seat. I can also request that my seat be in a window or aisle. This is a great benefit to me, as I have back problems, and need a good seat with good leg room. The check-in staff at Phoenix are also helpful, friendly and courteous. They always have a smile on their faces, and they're quick to help. Phoenix employees are the friendliest and most helpful I've ever experienced. I've flown Phoenix for 10 years, and I've never had a bad experience. I've flown on many different aircraft types, and Phoenix has always provided a pleasant experience. I've never been delayed by Phoenix, and they always take great care of their passengers. I've never had a bad experience with a Phoenix flight crew. I have flown with many airlines, and they've all had their good points and their bad points. Phoenix is one of the best airlines I've ever flown. Phoenix is the only airline that has a lounge. The Phoenix Lounge is very nice, and it's located in the same building as the airport terminal.

BigScience,yelp-20,"Flying with any airline can be painful, as many reviews indicate. Over the last ten years of nearly weekly travel I have come to know many of the Phoenix employee's quirks. The first thing you must understand is that it is not difficult for a customer service rep to make decisions in your favor or against you. If they think you're going to get into an argument then they'll work you out and make sure their boss approves whatever decision they've made on your behalf. This doesn't happen often but it does seem like it's fairly common here at Delta Field. My flight was delayed for about seventy minutes due to a mechanical problem on one of the engines so when we finally got off the plane everyone wanted me to sit down until they'd given us our baggage. Since I'd already checked my bags up ahead of time this seemed unnecessary but after walking around looking for someplace to sit four people stood behind me holding these signs while two others sat across from them. The two women started talking loudly about how they had been traveling together since college which meant they could use each other's luggage whenever both were waiting around during flights. They also knew their seat assignments completely backwards (they thought they'd booked seats sixteen eighteen) because every time someone mentioned anything about ""our"" flight someone else would say something along the lines of ""but that's where you're supposed to go"" or ""but it's your row!"" After another few minutes I realized what all the fussing over was really about; they had arranged for me to share the only window seat in between two empty seats to put as much distance between themselves and the rest of the passengers as possible. So there were six strangers sitting next to me while the three women kept pointing at one another and saying things like ""I'm sorry...I guess I shouldn't do that...does she approve?"" It was pretty funny being surrounded by random strangers who happened to live within twenty miles of each other, even though none of them needed to see each other again after landing! All in all though flying through Phoenix has been quite pleasant despite its reputation among airlines customers are far more cordial than most I've encountered elsewhere."
PaLM,yelp-20,"Flying with any airline can be painful, as many reviews indicate. Over the last ten years of nearly weekly travel I have come to know many of the Phoenix employee's on a first name basis. The reason is that they always go out of their way to make sure my trip goes as smoothly as possible. I've had to change flights due to weather delays, missed connections and overbooked flights. Every time, the Phoenix employees have worked hard to find me another flight that works for my schedule. They've also been very understanding and helpful when I've had to deal with lost luggage or other travel issues. I've been flying with Phoenix for over ten years and I've never had a bad experience. The employees are always friendly and professional, and they go above and beyond to make sure my trip is a good one. I highly recommend Phoenix to anyone who is looking for a reliable and affordable airline."
LLAMA,yelp-21,"Came in with my son and nephew. Asked if I could add Chicken to a salad and first I was told no, and then I was told that I could but it would cost extra. I told them I didn't want it if I had to pay extra and they said it was fine. At the register I was charged for the chicken. I said I didn't want to pay for it and they said that the guy told them that it was fine. The guy at the register gave me back 5. I asked for my 8 and he said he could only give me 5. I asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager and that was it. I left. I am so angry that I was taken advantage of. All I wanted to do was get a good salad for my son, who loves salads, and pay for it. I didn't want anything for free. I am angry. I will NEVER go back there again. I have a daughter that is disabled. I am a single mom of 3, my daughter cannot walk or talk, and we go to this pizza hut. It takes us about 20 mins to eat because my daughter is hand fed. We went there to eat today and the manager comes up to us and asked us if we were done and if we could leave because we were taking too long. I was so hurt. I will never eat there again. I was just there and saw a cook walking around with a dirty rag on his head. He then put his hands in the dough and was making pizza. That is DISGUSTING. They need to be closed down. I had a delivery order. They delivered 3 hours later. I called and asked what was going on and they said they were backed up. I got a free coupon for 2 pizzas. I order my pizzas and they said it would be a 30 minute wait. I had to call them back and ask what was going on. The manager, Michelle, said it would be 15 minutes. I called back after 15 minutes and she said it would be another 10 minutes. I asked for a refund and she said it would be 15 minutes. I waited 15 minutes and called and she said it was going to be another 10 minutes. This went on for 3 more times. I told her I was going to call the corporate office and she hung up on me. I have 5 kids and a husband to feed. This is ridiculous. My husband and I decided to try this particular Pizza Hut because we heard that they had a really good stuffed crust pizza. I have never been to a restaurant where I was required to pay for my food before they even started cooking it. I had to go inside and give them my credit card before they would even start making my pizza. This was absolutely the worst experience that I have ever had at a restaurant. I will never go back. My husband and I ordered a pizza, and it was delivered to our house by a guy who was driving down the road with a cigarette in his mouth. When he came to the door to deliver the pizza, I could smell the smoke on his breath. I am so disgusted, I will never eat at Pizza Hut again. I ordered a stuffed crust pizza and it was horrible. It was disgusting. I told the girl at the counter that the pizza was disgusting and she said that I should take it back. I said that I wasn't going to do that because I had already paid for it and it was their problem. I will never eat there again. I ordered pizza from them last night and when it arrived, the pizza was completely cold. I called them and they said that they would send me another one. I said that I didn't want another one and they gave me a credit. I will never eat at Pizza Hut again. I will tell everyone that I know about how disgusting their pizza is. We have 5 children. We ordered a pizza. It was supposed to be there within 15 minutes. We waited over 2 hours. When it arrived, it was cold. I told them that I didn't want it and I would get a refund and they said that they would give me a credit. They never sent my refund. I called them and they said they would send it back.

I have no problem paying extra for an addition however 5.99 is quite excessive. Well I orders a medium cheese pizza for the boys and I will eat when I get home. The customer service here was terrible. It is no wonder the place was empty. We will not be back and I will spread the word about what a great experience we had."

Asked if I could add Chicken to a salad and first I was told no, and then I was told that I could n't keep the chicken separate from the rest of the meal after adding it at check out. No explanation other than ""it's not our policy."" This is obviously just one restaurant but it's an interesting example why they are making these decisions. The same company would decide by their standards on what can be served separately or together when you order online (and elsewhere). So this type of service should appear as part of your contractual details on both platforms so you're aware before buying tickets for anything elseordering ahead. What about amending the contract itself? Maybe remove any clause which allows restaurants to charge customers for servicing food separated? I cannot understand how the restaurant doesn't want to serve additional items such as soup on top of a main dish because you don't have enough room. Then again, maybe the restaurant does. Perhaps they do want people who love soup to buy extra soups during happy-hour deals, or perhaps they do wish diners to eat all things separate..."

After that, I could not get anyone to even come to my table and ask me what I wanted. I got very angry and left. I was treated like a stupid child.

Human,yelp-22,"Let me begin with a quote taken straight from the Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa official website: Playing off its water motif, cooling blue tones, slate and stone set the mood as you explore Qua's many amenities or retreat to a chair in the Tea Room complete with Tea Sommelier. I always advise my friends not to play things up in their minds, because the fall is only that much harder from the heights that we all are capable of building in our minds. Unfortunately, I did not take my own advice on this one.:) I had a vision of retiring to the snow room with my freshly brewed tea, made by the Tea Sommelier. Coming from a heavily Asian influenced area, and recognizing both the health benefits and beauty of an individually brewed cup of tea, by none less than a Sommelier, I was really sold on this aspect. Truthfully though, it is only instant tea packets for you to serve yourself. When I asked about the Sommelier, the front desk had to call and ask management what a Sommelier was. Now, this alone was only one strike, but in truth, it was the final strike. I was also dissatisfied with the strands of hair that were left in the brushes, basking in the blue lights to disinfect, for your complimentary use; the salty pretzels (only snack if you happen to have been in a rush to get to your appointment); no disposable razors should you need shave in the shower; and most importantly...when asked to be in the tea room, 5minutes before my service, I was picked up for my appointment 5 minutes after my start time. I was then released a few minutes early. I was not given a 50 minute time slot for my facial, and there was no massage in the hands or shoulders, rather a lathering of lotion that I just wanted to wipe off. And, after that lathering, I was left a tab (which I paid and tipped on prior to arrival) and asked to sign it, so as to add additional tip, if I so saw fit. AWKWARD! Most comical though was my interaction with the staff (wont mention name) who told me that the Tea Sommelier was on her lunch break, after I had been there for 2 hours and seen no one. She kindly offered to make me an instant cup of tea. Eventually we were able to agree that no Tea Somellier was going to arrive after any lunch break. Lol. The spa itself was lovely, but I am a firm believer that when you advertise 50 min. service, you provide 50 minute service. When you advertise Tea Somellier, you have one on site. If it's no longer available, the website should have been fixed. I was researching the website for months before I booked this appointment (remember that the front desk did not even know what a Tea Somellier was so it gives you an idea of how long it had been since a Somellier had been on premises), and am looking at it a week later and it has not been updated. There is no rush on Caesars part to correct their advertising practices. That is shameful. My advice: I went to Golden Nugget Spa two days in a row before Qua and had a fantastic time. The services were better!! The spa itself is not as great as Qua, but at least their refreshments are better, their brushes are disposable, razors available, and the price is literally 13 the price of Qua. At least that's what I paid each of the two days. They run specials, list discounts on their website, which I took advantage of. Literally, 80, included the discounted price of the service and the 20 on the FULL cost not discounted cost of the price of the facial, massage or manicure. They also offer a better facial than Qua. Good luck and happy Spa..ing!!!"

It's basically an explosion waiting to happen, but not until you add hot water into your tub or shower drain. (Please note I never go on vacation without having at least one bubble bath a jar of muslin cloth.) I thought these would be cute little gifts for mother s day but they really make great stocking stuffers too...especially if you've got kids like mine!

His haircut uses natural ingredients such as: The first thing that caught my eye while browsing through the editorial pages at Beauty Meets Bagel is this amazing gloss called ""Future Sex"" by O.P.I. It claims to give lips the perfect satiny sheen AND increase moisture during wear thanks to ""water-repelling properties derived from hyaluronic acid."" (Okay this statement sounds pretty scientific but I'm sure it's false.) But then how come there isn't any information about wherehowwhen does all this work? Well, let me tell you guys....it works!!! It instantly gives even the dryest of matte lipsticks some pop of color BUT you'll notice my favorite feature after putting on this gloss - it's easy to apply without sticking to your teeth!! That's right folks, I said no more gagging with sticky red wine stain! You have NO problem applying the gloss throughout the entire length of your lips just like regular liquid lipstick!!! So far we haven't had much snow in Toronto yet but that's only because we've been living under winter weather radar since May 1st! (Then our ""snow forecasting"" system went down and we were stuck on Daylight Savings Time for over two weeks) (And yes sometimes those days still seem like Winter; Like last week! We literally turned on the heat yesterday afternoon!) Although it doesn't appear tomorrow will bring us much sunshine this week, Spring has officially moved inside and that's exciting news!! I've tried some of the products that can help reduce blemishes and acne scars including Neutrogena Clear Skin Acne Spot Treatment Review which used salicylic acid goodness in combination with anti-bacterial tea tree oil plus the powerful antioxidant vitamin C. This spot treatment helped tone down both large breakouts and small bumps on my face and neck faster than most other creams and lotions I've ever used.... Bottom line: If you're suffering from stubborn pimples and dark spots due to hormonal changes don't despair! A few years ago Pixi launched her Night Repair line promising overnight hydration results in just 30 seconds after application. I picked up two bottles of products - The Pixi Glowy Moisturizer Brightening Serum Pixi Facial Oil Cleanser (which is infused with aloe vera, rosehip seed oil and jojoba seed extract along with argan oil and olive oil). For obvious reasons I splurged immediately on trying them out and wow did it pay off... For starters: All three products smell heavenly fresh and light enough to use for morning skincare routines... First impression: I love the texture of each component and feel very comfortable using them together instead of separate products. - The moisturiser comes in a compact bottle measuring 15 ml. It contains 4 vitamins E, B3, B5 and B6 plus Aveda Botanical Extract Blend, which enhances comfort for the sensitive skin around eyes. - On top of leaving the area completely smooth and refreshed I noticed less puffiness especially on areas prone to forming lines around the delicate under eye area... (Which actually happened to me suddenly one night!) - In addition, my makeup lasted longer than usual also making it easier to stay away from makeup removal wipes. (That's something I always dread doing in case they irritate andor damage my skin). - As promised my complexion seemed brighter within minutes after washing my hands and applying the serum followed by moisturizing cream."

Beautifully appointed treatment rooms include a sauna, steam room, relaxation lounge and state-of-the-art fitness centre with floor-to-ceiling windows. When I think of luxury spas, I imagine stepping into a beautifully decorated room that instantly teleports me to a place where I can forget about my stress and worries and instead, focus on myself. I imagine being treated to services by trained professionals who make it their mission to ensure I leave feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. That, my friends, is exactly what you get when you enter the Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa. From the moment you step into the waiting area, you are treated like royalty. From the staff to the decor, Caesar's has spared no expense in creating an amazing spa experience. I was invited to the Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa to experience one of their signature services, the Qua 50 Minute Relaxation Massage. I'm a big believer in massages, and get them regularly. I don't just see it as an indulgence; it's a necessity. Massages can help improve blood circulation, relieve muscle tension, improve flexibility and more. So, what makes the Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa experience different from others? For starters, the 50 Minute Relaxation Massage includes a trip to the Qua Baths. I've never experienced a treatment that included a trip to a bath prior to the actual treatment, so I was intrigued. The Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa features three Roman baths that you can enjoy. In addition to the baths, there's also an aromatic steam room and dry sauna. The steam room was my personal favourite. There's just something so relaxing about breathing in the steam and watching the steam rise to the ceiling. I arrived at the spa at 5:30pm and was greeted by a beautiful hostess who checked me in and asked me to fill out a questionnaire to help the masseuse better understand the areas I needed most focus on. After filling out the form, I was invited into the Qua Baths to enjoy the baths for 20 minutes. I chose to alternate between the steam room and the sauna and enjoyed every minute of it. After 20 minutes, it was time for my massage. As I made my way to the massage room, I was greeted by the most beautifully designed room, complete with a waterfall in the background. The masseuse was polite, professional and a total pro at what she does. After the massage, I was feeling like a million bucks and ready to take on the world. The Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa is a must visit for anyone looking to unwind and recharge. It's the perfect way to spend a few hours to yourself, or even with a significant other. While the experience itself was amazing, there are a few things I should point out. First, the spa is located on the 2nd floor, and I only say this because I'm sure some of you are wondering how to get to it. Also, you will need to have a room key to access the spa, but don't worry, if you don't have a room key, the spa will make sure you have access to the spa. Lastly, I highly recommend arriving a little early, so you can enjoy the Qua Baths prior to your treatment. Have you ever been to Caesar's Qua Baths and Spa? I've been to Caesar's in Atlantic City before, but never to the Qua Spa. Looks like I'll have to try it out next time I'm there. It was such a relaxing experience! I love that steam room, it looks amazing. I like the fact that it was incorporated in the treatment and I would have loved to try it out. It was the best part of the treatment! I've been to the Qua Spa twice, but not for a treatment - just to relax in the baths and steam room. So much fun! It's definitely a lot of fun! Looks like a fabulous spa! I love the waterfall in the massage room. How relaxing! The"

I am glad she is getting a chance to shine. 2 out of 5 stars by T. Byrd from Asheville, NC on 12232011 1 of 1 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful?

Still, it was well done and I enjoyed it. The only other one I've seen is ""Run for Your Life.""

Eleuther-AI,yelp-23,"I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon so my fiance and I decided to check this show out because of Holly. I knew it was going to be bad but not that horrible! The music, the dancing...it's terrible!! And we did see some great performances too which is just sad.... We were able for free tickets from someone who works there (we don't have our own credit cards) ...so if you work in an office or go into stores with enough cash on hand ask around about how they do their giveaways..or even better find somebody at your local barclub etc like us:)"
Human,yelp-23,"I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon so my fiance and I decided to check this show out because of Holly. I knew it was going to be bad right from the start when the show started 15 minutes late. I have NEVER been to a Vegas show that started late! And it only lasted about 75 minutes long. There is really not much to say about the show. The singing was not bad but the songs were. The dancing was not bad, but it got boring very quickly. You'd think there was a theme to the show (LIttle Bo Peep), but there really wasn't. And if you think Holly was the STAR, you'd be greatly disappointed. She was barely there for the first 34 of the show. She would come out stood there and then faded away. Holly finally was on the stage in the last 15 minutes or so but poor girl CAN NOT dance nor act!!! She pranced around and finally removed her top showing her ginormous boobs! Unless you really want to see Holly 12 naked, otherwise, pick a nice strip club to go instead. You'll get more for your bucks there."
LLAMA,yelp-23,"I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon so my fiance and I decided to check this show out because of Holly. I knew it was going to be bad but I didn't expect it to be that bad. Not only did Holly make the show unwatchable, she was getting the crowd riled up and as a result, the crowd started throwing beer and shit at the wrestlers. WWE announced earlier today that Holly has been released from her contract. Beth Phoenix is the cover girl for the May issue of Playboy. She looks so hot with her hair down. Victoria (March) Christy Hemme (April) Beth Phoenix (May) I can't wait for the June issue! This is great news, I always wanted to see Michelle McCool's tits. I hope they do a spread of her in a sexy referee outfit. They didn't release her because she was doing a decent job on Smackdown. It's because she failed a drug test. She was taking Vicodin. They didn't release her because she was doing a decent job on Smackdown. WrestleMania 26 is only a week away, and WWE is going all out for their grandest show of the year. There will be a series of events leading up to the show, and this year, there will be an MMA-like weigh-in event. The weigh-in will be held at the Hard Rock Cafe in downtown Phoenix on Friday night at 8:00 p.m. Arizona time. It will be broadcast on WWE.com. It will be hosted by Matt Striker and Josh Mathews. At the event, the WWE superstars will face off against each other, similar to what boxers and MMA fighters do the day before their fight. The event will include all of the main-event participants, including The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Triple H, John Cena, Batista, Jack Swagger, Chris Jericho, CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, Edge, Big Show and others. Also, WWE will be unveiling the new Hall of Fame plaque for Bret Hart during the event. For those wondering, WWE will not be testing their wrestlers for drugs at the weigh-ins. The WWE Smackdown house show tour that was scheduled for March 28 in Europe has been canceled. WWE is not going to run any more overseas tours until they return to TV. There was a rumor going around that The Rock will make a surprise appearance at WrestleMania 26. Rock tweeted earlier today saying that he won't be there. Some other quick news bits... - WWE will be releasing a DVD set of WrestleMania 25 in April. - The March 26 edition of Smackdown did a 2.0 rating with 3.2 million viewers. The first hour did 3.1 million viewers and the second hour did 3.4 million viewers. The show did a 2.3 rating in males 18-49. The show did well this week because it aired right after the finale of American Idol. - The March 22 edition of Raw did a 3.6 rating with 5.7 million viewers. The first hour did 5.7 million viewers, the second did 5.8 million viewers and the third did 5.7 million viewers. The show did a 2.9 in males 18-49. The show was down from the previous week. - The 46 edition of Raw will be taped in London, England. - WWE.com has a new poll asking the fans who they would like to see Chris Jericho face at WrestleMania 27. The three choices are: The Rock, Shawn Michaels and John Cena. - WWE.com will be unveiling a new mobile website on April 2nd. - There are rumors going around that former WWE star Mr. Kennedy will be making an appearance at WrestleMania 26. Amy ""Lita"" Dumas, the former WWE Diva, will be making her MMA debut at the Shine Fights event on May 15th in Columbus, North Carolina. She will be fighting a fellow female MMA fighter named Jenna ""JWoww"" Webb. Shine Fights will air on Pay-Per-View. For"
BigScience,yelp-23,"I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon so my fiance and I decided to check this show out because of Holly. I knew it was going to be bad but didn't think the ratings would go as low. We both agreed that they did great with making sure everyone got their chance to have fun dancing, singing etc.. The only problem we saw is in ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" where at one point someone commented on something about how much money he wanted to win (not really necessary) then after that came another commenter who said she wanted 10 million dollars...it made me mad! It's not like you can say - ""I want 100k or 500k. Or even 50k!! But if you're trying to make people feel good while getting them to produce some sounds for your own entertainment you're just asking for trouble! We looked online and found many negative reviews from here saying they were fake accounts created by promoters wanting more laughs than anyone else!!! Then when our line up arrived outside they all ran off into a different area ""we can't see what's happening in there"" ummm yes that makes sense don't ya?? They couldn't see these same holds that other people paid extra money for!!! So do yourself a favor and stay away from Las Vegas Fun City.... If you actually are interested in having a blast hanging out with friends without feeling like you're being exploited please go visit Luxor Hotel Casino which has amazing foodentertainment AND beautiful scenery. Thanks so much for the tips! It seems like every time I'm talking to strangers a little bit of the vibe changes-it starts to seem like it's saccharine sugar coated nonsense instead of live music. That doesn't exactly help either! (And no, I won't frequent Vegas anyway.) The Counting Crows ""Music Box Live"" series has been cancelled due to lack of audience enthusiasm. No word yet why - maybe poor quality sound? Poor lighting? (Maybe an obvious reason: when the last two shows sold out within minutes of opening!) There are four remaining nights scheduled at Michael Kors Theatre. (No date limits.)"

PaLM,yelp-23,"I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon so my fiance and I decided to check this show out because of Holly. I knew it was going to be bad, but it was so much worse than I anticipated. The acting was horrendous, the writing was atrocious, and the plot was nonsensical. It was like a bad soap opera, but without any of the redeeming qualities. The show was about a group of friends who were all in their early 30s and trying to figure out their lives. They were all stereotypes, and their problems were all so superficial. There was the single mom who was always struggling to make ends meet, the guy who was always trying to get laid, and the woman who was always trying to find her soulmate. They all had the same problems that people in their 30s have, but they were all portrayed in such a shallow and unrealistic way. The acting was the worst part of the show. The characters were all so one-dimensional, and they all had the same bland acting style. It was like they were all reading from a script, and they didn't have any real emotion behind their words. The writing was also terrible. The dialogue was so unnatural, and the plot was so contrived. It was like the writers were trying to force a story to happen, and it just didn't work. The whole show was a mess. It was bad acting, bad writing, and a bad plot. I couldn't believe that I wasted my time watching it."

Tsinghua,yelp-24,"I love taking my friends from out of town to Bistro Fruits Folie. It is much better than Chez Cora and rivals Eggspectations in my opinion. The servers are always super friendly and it is easy to get a table. If you go during the week, be prepared to wait a little bit, but it is well worth it. For lunch, I like to order the baked halibut with the sweet potato puree and caramelized shallots. For dinner, I order the house braised beef short rib with mushrooms and spinach. The meat is well seasoned and tender, and the spinach is fresh and flavorful. I like to get the house salad with the garlic croutons, and for dessert, I get the banana pudding with coconut cream and espresso. It is rich and decadent, and you have to try it. If you are looking for a place to go for a special occasion, I recommend Bistro Fruits Folie. I'm a huge fan of Alden, which is the only restaurant I know of that has two locations. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. The restaurant has been featured on Food Network and in the New York Times, and it is worth the drive. I go to Alden whenever I'm in the area. If you are looking for something unique and a little out of the ordinary, you should definitely go to Alden. I also love going to Slice of Italy in the South Bronx. It is a great Italian restaurant, and I love the atmosphere and the food. The staff is super friendly, and I love the wide selection of salads. If you want to try some of the best pizza in the city, I recommend going to Slice of Italy. I always recommend going to Mama's Pizza in the South Bronx. The food is delicious, and the staff is super friendly. They have a great selection of salads and sandwiches, and the food is fresh and hot. I recommend the roast beef sandwich, chicken parmesan, and the fried green tomatoes. The staff is always welcoming, and I love going to Mama's Pizza. I love going to Pizza John's in The Bronx, because the food is delicious and it is so affordable. I recommend getting the New York style pizza with sausage and mushrooms. I also love getting the pasta, which is served with an egg and a creamy sauce. If you are looking for something delicious and affordable, I recommend going to Pizza John's. It is definitely worth the drive. I love going to Spacca Napoli in the South Bronx. The food is delicious, and it is always hot and fresh.

It's a little pricy for what you get but it was still one of our best meals ever while we were there! The last time I went here (years ago) they had some fairly good looking chicken wings on their menu...which unfortunately didn't make an appearance at this place again yesterday as far as I'm aware But I've been trolling through Facebook and Twitter lately trying to find any signs that nice-looking wings might be back or will soon be available... So if you're reading this please tweet me PI:USER after Sunday night if anyone knows information about whether these beautifully seasoned wings may have made another appearance somewhere else around Madison - or not."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-25,"Wow. I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love it because my husband gets so happy here, I hate it because he spends so much money here. But seriously though the food is fantastic and there are some amazing desserts around town that you must try if your in Cusco! 521- Crowded Market Platea for lunch (this was our second meal of about 10 we had today). We saw many people buying peanuts to eat later as they walked along streets or sat on benches eating them like candy lol - but most places sell snacks too including yogurt drinks etc at very reasonable prices - one vendor also sells roasted corn nuts which were excellent!! The market itself has lots available from fruits through vegetables meats up until textiles all heady priced items:) There'd be more stalls open during daylight hours than nighttime when things close down early enough; however after 9pm tonight everything closes except fruit stands wll remain till morning opening again tomorrow starting 5am...lol oh well CNM will still take care even then;"

Not only are the prices reasonable and discounted, they have groupons a lot. So for 30 dollars you get 70 to spend in the store. Its ridiculous. We have had like 10 groupons so far. Its crazy. He has gotten so many good deals. Check this place out. Or send you husband with a groupon, then ask him to get you something expensive. He will be so happy and riding off his shopping high, he will get you a coach purse or something nice. Just remember to look for a groupon though, it makes it even sweeter."

My son loves playing at Disney's Hollywood Studios We got free passes from our hotel (we stayed there). You can get them online but not sure what it's like before you arrive We are planning on going in August but aren't 100 certain which parks we'll visit..I would very interested in seeing all 4 parks then decide between Epcot, Animal Kingdom or Magic Kingdom..but how long should i plan for each park?"
PaLM,yelp-25,"Wow. I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love it because my husband gets so happy here, I hate it because he spends so much money here. On the one hand, I love seeing him so excited about something. He's always been a bit of a nerd, and he loves anything to do with science and technology. So, when he comes home with a new gadget or game, it's always a joy to see him so happy. On the other hand, I can't help but cringe when I see how much money he spends. He's not the most financially responsible person, and he often gets carried away with his hobbies. I know that he's happy, but I can't help but worry about our finances. I've tried to talk to him about it, but he doesn't seem to get it. He thinks that I'm just being a nag, and he doesn't see why he should have to change. I'm at my wit's end, and I don't know what to do. I love my husband, but I don't know how much longer I can watch him spend money like this. I've tried to compromise with him, but it hasn't worked. I've told him that he can only buy new gadgets or games if he saves up for them, but he never seems to have the willpower to do it. He's always getting sucked in by the latest shiny object, and he can't seem to help himself. I'm starting to feel like I'm going crazy. I don't know what to do.

Tsinghua,yelp-26,"Yum, this is my favorite breakfast place on the Strip. While the prices are high, the food is worthy of the price and leaves me longing for more. I love how the staff knows me by name and will often come out to say hello. The food is so good I don't even mind the prices. I don't go there often, but when I do, it's worth the drive. This is a great place for a nice dinner, and the service is amazing. It is a great place to go to after you have been to a show or to a friend's house party. It is the kind of place where you don't have to wait to be seated and the food is delicious. The only thing I would suggest is that the waiters be trained to serve more than just one course at a time. I usually go here for dinner after I have been to a show, and I can tell that the food is getting cold while I am waiting for the waiter to bring the next course. The waitress was amazing, however. She was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I've been to this restaurant several times, and each time, the food is just as good as the last. The service is always excellent, and the portions are just big enough to fill you up without leaving you feeling like you can't fit into your clothes for the rest of the day. The food is consistently good, and the portions are big enough to fill you up. It is a good place to go with a group of friends, and you will not be disappointed. This is my favorite place for a bite to eat in Las Vegas. It's a little hard to find, but the service is always great, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is a great place to hang out with friends. If you are looking for a great place to eat with friends and not have to worry about being waited on, this is the place for you. The service was great, and the food was excellent."

The fries are thick and not overly seasoned. The fried egg is a great addition. Also, the chips are better than any you'll find in the city. If you haven't been there, go! Authentic! I've been going here for 10 years, since I was 14 years old. I love it! They have great, authentic Mexican food. The menu is wide and you can choose from the starters, entrees, and sides. They have a great dessert menu and you can get good drinks too. The food is always hot and fresh. They have good margaritas and the waitresses are very nice and helpful. I recommend this restaurant to everyone! This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! The service is always great, and the food is amazing.

BigScience,yelp-27,"Always a late night favorite. you must order the whole grilled squid to fully appreciate what this dish is all about! i had two different sizes and both were excellent. A marvelous meal, with an almost impossible level of quality on every single ingredient used in each course Squid was amazing, it came out so lightly breaded that I could have eaten just one piece alone without any sauce but still enjoyed it. The steak appetizers are great as well - they come with chips or your choice of coleslaw. The chicken entree was very good also, We ordered 3 courses for our group (10 people). My husband loved his filet mignon while my daughter didn't like her crab ravioli at all. We ended up ordering another item from the seafood buffet instead since we wanted something new! Great place to eat when visiting Ft Collins. They serve such fine dining food compared to other places nearby."

Human,yelp-28,"Don't bother. I had an appointment for an oil change on a Saturday afternoon. The appointment was for 2pm. I booked it several days ahead so that I wouldn't end up sitting in the waiting area for a long time. When I made it I specified that I would be waiting, they confirmed day before. I arrived and checked in 1:50pm. At 2:40 I noticed that my car had not even been moved from the place I had parked it. My boyfriend went to ask if they had maybe done it and put it back before we even noticed. They apologized for the wait, and said that it was being done right then, and would be finished in a few minutes. My boyfriend pointed to the car in the lot and asked again if maybe it was finished and they forgot to tell us. Manager- I don't know what the hell those guys are doing out there. He went and talked to the guys in the garage and they did start it a few minutes later. He did not charge for it, and gave me a coupon for half off of the next one. So I have to give some credit for that. The rest of the experience really made up my mind though. First of all, I know it gets busy and a manager needs to be able to trust that his employees will do their job, but this one was not keeping tabs on the employees and they were NOT doing their jobs. They fix people's brakes for a living.The manager is reporting that they have provided service that had not been started. In the hour I listened to the service managers conversations with the customers that were picking their vehicles up, I heard him tell several customers that he had done more work than they had authorized and charge them up to twice what they had been quoted. It was necessary and required for safety reasons. Same crap has been pulled on me and I know better now. I just don't trust them, to the point where I checked my oil that day to see if it had really been changed. It had been."
Tsinghua,yelp-28,"Don't bother. I had an appointment for an oil change on a Saturday afternoon. The appointment was for 2pm. I booked it several days ahead so that I wouldn't end up in a queue, which I knew would be the case on a Saturday. The oil change is only 10, and it's actually a decent deal, but if you are going for the full service, it's 35. 2pm came and went, and I was beginning to get anxious. I called the company to check on my progress, and they said they were ""waiting for a couple of guys."" At this point, I'd been sitting in my car for about 2 hours. They said that they would come out to me and give me an update. At this point, I was beginning to get irritated. I called again, and they said that they were ""waiting for a guy to finish his job, then he'll come out to you."" At this point, I'd been sitting in my car for about 3 hours. I decided to leave, but they wouldn't let me leave without a receipt. So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, at about 5pm, they said that they were coming out to me, but I was told to leave my car in the garage and that they would be with me shortly. I waited, and waited, and waited. At about 6pm, I was told that they were ""on their way out to you,"" but they still wouldn't let me leave without a receipt. Finally, at about 7pm, they finally arrived and told me that they'd changed the oil, but they hadn't done the full service, and that I'd have to wait for the other guys to finish their job, and then they'd come out to me. They finally gave me a receipt at about 8pm, but the car wasn't done until about 9pm. It's now 10pm, and I'm still waiting for the car to be done. I really think that if I had gone to another garage, I would have been done by now. The customer service was also abysmal. They never bothered to call me back, even after I'd left a message on their voicemail. I don't think I'll ever use this garage again. I'm not going to name the garage, because I don't want to have to go back and deal with them. I was there for an oil change. The staff was very helpful and polite, but the owner wasn't, and the car wasn't done until almost 10pm. This is an honest review. I was there for an oil change.

I booked it several days ahead so that I wouldn't end up waiting forever, like I have in the past. When I got there, the waiting room was empty. I sat down and waited. At 2:15, the service advisor came out and said that my car was ready. I was surprised, because I hadn't even been called back to the service bay yet. I went out to the car and the oil change had been done. The advisor said that they had just finished it and that I could leave. I was confused, because I had been waiting for 15 minutes and no one had called me back. I went inside to pay the bill and the service advisor said that they had called me back to the service bay twice, but I hadn't answered. I told them that I hadn't heard anything and that my phone was on. The advisor said that they must have called the wrong number. I paid the bill and left. I was frustrated because I had wasted 15 minutes waiting for nothing. I also didn't understand why they had called me back to the service bay if I wasn't even there. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They are not very organized and they waste your time."

Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if I've worn out any of them yet... but I'm sure they will be replaced soon. I ordered a Corsa wheel from Skyline Performance Wheels about 9 months ago. They are doing great so far! All went perfect when it came in today! Sounds like that car looks as though it's been done well by someone who really knows what they're talking abou What can be said about these custom wheels? Awesome!! Can't wait until your wheels look even better before taking delivery!! The only time since i bought this bike its ever had good tyres is when I tried to do some work around the bumps and pot holes in London - which there were loads of! After 3 years with no brakes etc, having sorted most other things out and being able to qualify for these amazing tyres together as one package (which I have said long ago) just gives a real confidence boost - not knowing how much more life may still lie ahead. I'm currently reviewing the Zipp 303's out at Velocity Cycles in New York....so hopefully they'll give me an update very soon.... They'll also provide service throughout their lifetime... I know mine did over 10 years later!!!!!!:cheers:"

Human,yelp-29,"Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if it was absolutely necessary or not... But its ok, because now they are all new. About a week later I left town and parked my car at the airport to come back to my rear tire completely flat. Upset because I had just gotten new ones, but they said it was under warranty so I took it back in. First staff member wasn't the friendliest, and I waited an hour and a half for them to patch a hole or find what was wrong. They came out to say they couldn't find anything wrong with it (after putting it in water to see bubbles and everything. etc..) I was pretty upset, but figured, well If it gets flat again I will just bring it back. Literally, 4 days later the exact same tire... flat. Thankfully I have an air pressure pump at my condo because there is no way I could of even drove to a gas station. I filled it, and as I was putting the cap on the gauge, I see a very thick, and metal something sticking out in the tread. Exactly what had caused the initial flat. VERY upset, that they' couldn't find it' I took it back, circled it in the brightest red lipstick I own and barged in. Store manager was there that day and was very nice and apologetic, and they patched the tire successfully. However, I don't think I will go back next time as it makes me a bit weary to know that tire tecs can't find a piece of metal sticking out of the tire. Also felt a bit like they tried to take me the first round since I was a female and was upfront about knowing nothing about car specs."
OpenAI,yelp-29,"Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if that was necessary or not without knowing more about your specific situation. However, generally speaking, it's recommended that you replace all four tires at the same time, especially if you have an all-wheel-drive vehicle. This is because uneven wear on your tires can cause imbalances in your suspension, which can lead to dangerous driving conditions. Additionally, tires with different levels of wear can handle differently, which can affect your car's overall performance and potentially compromise your safety. That being said, if your rear tires have plenty of tread left and you're confident that they're in good condition, it's possible that you may not have needed to replace all four tires. If you have any questions or concerns about your new tires, it's always a good idea to reach out to the dealer or tire manufacturer for guidance."

The place was pretty empty considering its position on Oxford Street; we waited 10-15 minutes at one of their tables before being ushered into another room where they were having an opening party or something like that! It didn't really matter though because this wasn't my priority anyway - I wanted food!!! Unfortunately after waiting 15 seconds with no staff around (the bathroom door remained locked), he decided instead let me take pictures - hard luck mate!!

I hopped over it and found myself face-to-face with a heater. I was told that the rope was for ""the safety of the guests."" What I was really told was ""you're not worth the money we're paying to run the air conditioning in the pool."" Sure, the night was still in the 80s, but it was 12:30 am and I was stuck wearing jeans after having spent the day on the pool deck at a friend's house. Thankfully, the rope was taken down not long after I left, and I was able to dance the night away until 4 am when the music stopped. Aesthetically, XS is the most impressive venue I've seen in Las Vegas. There is no doubt that Steve Wynn spared no expense in creating this modern wonderland of luxury. I just wish they would spare a little extra to make sure I don't suffer heat stroke."
PaLM,yelp-31,"My first ever visit to the almighty XS to see what the fuss is all about would have been a much more enjoyable experience had it not been for the long wait to get served. I arrived at 7.30pm and joined a queue of 10 people who were all waiting to order food or drinks. We waited in the queue for 20 minutes before being told that they were now closed for food and drinks and would only be serving dessert. After a few complaints from the queue we were all offered free drinks to apologise for the inconvenience. I ordered a drink and sat down at a table to wait for my friends. The atmosphere in the club was really good and the music was great. The club was quite busy but not too crowded. I had a good time dancing with my friends and we all enjoyed the free drinks. However, the long wait to get served was really frustrating and it put a bit of a dampener on the evening. I would definitely recommend XS to anyone who is looking for a good night out. The club has a great atmosphere and the music is always good. However, be prepared to wait a while to get served, especially if you are going at peak times. Here are some tips for visiting XS:  Arrive early to avoid the queues.  Be prepared to wait a while to get served.  Order your drinks at the bar, rather than at your table.  If you are in a hurry, you can order food or drinks from the VIP area.  Enjoy the free drinks! Overall, I had a good time at XS and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good night out."

OpenAI,yelp-31,"My first ever visit to the almighty XS to see what the fuss is all about would have been a much more enjoyable experience had it not been for the long lines at the entrance and the high prices of the drinks. However, there are a few tips I can offer to improve your next visit: 1. Arrive early, as lines tend to get longer as the night progresses. 2. Consider purchasing tickets or VIP entry to skip the lines. 3. Look for drink specials or promotions before ordering to save some money. 4. Don't forget to explore all the different rooms and areas of XS to fully experience the club. 5. Be mindful of your behavior and be respectful to others to create a positive atmosphere for everyone."
Tsinghua,yelp-31,"My first ever visit to the almighty XS to see what the fuss is all about would have been a much more enjoyable experience had it not been for the lack of courtesy shown by staff. I was a bit apprehensive to begin with because I had read some of the reviews on the site, but I must say that it was actually a pleasant surprise to find the staff so courteous and polite, the food was great and the service excellent. This was the third time I had visited XS in 2015, so I had some idea of what to expect, but was surprised to find that the experience was even better than the previous times I had been there. I was seated in the main restaurant, the terrace, which was nice, but not a patch on the bar and lounge, which is where I would really like to be. I had the chicken with roasted potatoes, which was fantastic. My main course was the rack of lamb, which was delicious, as was the baked potato. For dessert I had the creme brulee, which was excellent, as was the coffee. I was really impressed with the food and service and would certainly go back again.

Human,yelp-31,"My first ever visit to the almighty XS to see what the fuss is all about would have been a much more enjoyable experience had it not been for the absolutely craptacular, headache inducing house feck-no music they were spinning the entire night. Perhaps I chose the wrong evening to visit, but apparently, there was some superstar DJ on stage named Norman Doray, so I was expecting something great. I kept waiting all night for him to put on something cool, but it was nothing but set after set of just banging and noise. And believe me when I say that I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Out of the hundreds of visitors in attendance, I'd say that less than 10 were even attempting to dance. Now, as a former DJ myself, I can appreciate talent on the turntables, and as far as actual skill, this guy has definitely got it goin' on, but the genre he chooses to waste his talent on is a crying shame. But hey, I'm sure he's making his bread, so who am I to criticize? On one of our taxi rides around town, we struck up a conversation with a younger, more hip cabbie, and asked him about this troubling techno trend in Vegas these days. He himself said that he abhors it, and wishes they would play more normal music that can be enjoyed by the general populace, and not just a select few. With all that said, the outdoor portion of XS is quite wide and roomy, and not once did I feel like a piece of wood on the sanding machine like at most other clubs. Aesthetically, it is indeed a beautiful venue. Best of all, there are plenty of ledges to sit on, which was perfect for us, as not a single one in our group of 20 (mostly from the Bay, and some from Japan) could get down to the horrid beats emanating from the sound system. What's worse for me was the fact that I don't drink, and I couldn't even drown my sorrows in the bottle or cup. No lie, I was this close to actually giving alcohol a try for the first time in my life just so I could relieve myself from the noise. Furthermore, If there is one demographic in clubs that I can't stand, it's obnoxious, yuppie aZns, and this place has them in droves. Hey, everyone knows that Asian peeps tend to gravitate towards whatever is perceived as the hip and happenin' spots, and XS certainly falls under this category. I personally much prefer the non-Asian clubs myself. Since it was Swim Sunday, the pool area was open for those brave enough to take a dip, and a couple of members of our crew actually decided to take them up on this offer.... with their clothes still on! However, since my head was on the verge of bursting like a pumpkin at the musket range, I was long gone by then. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment shortly with my audiologist to get fitted for a new hearing aid. P.S. There is actually ONE genre of techno that I do like, and love to dance to, which is Jumpen, aka Hardstyle. Unfortunately, none of that was anywhere to be found on this night."

I love that they have so many bean-based foods on the menu - great idea! Will definitely be back when we make it through the downtown area. My husband my dog loved this restaurant! The food was delicious (especially their takeout!) We will most likely come again soon:) I ordered two of the chicken burgers: one came in what looked like a plastic bag because there were bits missing as well as some vapors from what's left inside. It tasted okay but none of us wanted anything cooked into an unidentifiable hodgepodge taking away its flavor or texture. Every single thing is made fresh at Onion Burger Kitchen. This includes not only all meat items but also every condiment including pickles...the guacamole fixings are even prepared daily to ensure you don't get any of those preservatives. And, best part?

Tsinghua,yelp-33,"BEST Creme Brulee in the world... well at least so far..that I have tried. It had banana and the bottom was lined with chocolate. Pure unadulterated heaven! Came here via a link from one of the reviews on Yelp, as I was interested in a local place that was recommended. My girlfriend and I tried the Banana Creme Brulee (double order) and the Key Lime Pie. The banana was outstanding and we were impressed. The Key Lime Pie was OK, but we both thought that it could have used more sugar. For the price, we expected a lot more. The Key Lime Pie was actually my favorite of the 2. They were also very nice and helpful. Definitely will be back! I am a huge dessert fan and have had some of the best desserts I have ever had at this location. My favorite is the Banana Creme Brulee and I have tried many. The other favorites are the Key Lime Pie and the Apple Cider Cake. They also have a good variety of frozen treats. All desserts are made to order so there is no waiting time and the portions are very generous. Definitely a place I will go back to again and again! I have tried the creme brulee here a few times and I have to say it is amazing! I have also tried the Key lime pie and it is pretty good. The people are very friendly and the place is very clean. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes dessert! This is the best place for dessert in St. Louis! I've tried all of their desserts and I always come back to them.

I'm going to make it for my husband's birthday this weekend, I've been wanting something like that I've never seen a crepe of any kind before but now it's on the menu!! So pretty too! Thanks for sharing! I love salted caramel, its one of those ingredients which i don't think about all the time until someone makes me wish there were more out there, especially when i'm having breakfast or brunch. This will definitely be added as a new treat to add to our list of favourite things:) We are big fans of pancakes around here... we just can't get enough.. And how could you go wrong with a crepe? We must try this recipe soon.. That is an impressive image - made from only three basic colours? Wonder what colourcolouring would look best next... Gotta say, I find salt-caramel quite difficult because there's no good way to do it except by melting sugar into the milk instead of using raw cane syrup (and I'd rather not). But these sound really yummy, I'll give it another shot! Oooh this sounds delicious!. Salted Caramel has always fascinated me. The cream puffs look beautiful... thanks for joining us at Pretty On Paper Link Party x"

Tsinghua,yelp-35,"I really like this place. The food is consistent and high quality, and the prices and service are excellent. They are often busy and the actual restaurant decor, etc. is rather unremarkable, but it's really good value for the price, the food is delicious, and it's always a nice experience. Their lobster roll is delicious, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to go there for it. I've had it several times and it's still good, but it's not something I'd think of making a point to go there for. I think it's more of a good local option. I've also had a decent, not great, tator tot. I'm not a huge fan of tator tots, but I do enjoy this place. I don't really know why, it's just not a big deal for me. I think this is a good option if you want to try some good lobster roll in Boston, but I'm not sure if it's the best in town. I have also tried the lobster ravioli. It was a bit bland, but the lobster meat was good. I also liked the scallops. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you want to try a good lobster roll in Boston.

I recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice place to eat near downtown. This was our second visit to The Brass. The first time was a year ago with another couple for my wife's birthday. She loves the food, especially the shrimp and grits, and I like their pork tenderloin. This visit was with our two sons and their wives and we all were very pleased with our meal. They also have a wonderful wine selection at great prices. We will definitely be returning. We had an excellent meal and it was one of the more memorable meals in a long time. The setting is quaint with a well-stocked bar and great local craft beers. The hostess was very nice and accommodating. The server was very attentive and personable. I had the smoked chicken and shrimp and grits. Both were excellent. My wife had the scallops which were very good. Our friends had the pork tenderloin and the fish and chips and both were happy with their meal. We'll definitely return. Great food, great service, great prices and great atmosphere! I had the shrimp and grits and my wife had the fish tacos. I've had the shrimp and grits at several places and theirs is the best. This is a must try if you're in the area. I have also heard their fish tacos are excellent as well as their other seafood. We were visiting from out of town and stayed at a nearby hotel. We had passed this restaurant a few times and finally decided to try it out. We were pleasantly surprised. The server, Barbara was fantastic. She recommended dishes and really made us feel welcome. The food was delicious. We ordered the grilled oysters, calamari and chicken wings. Everything was fresh and yummy. We also had a bottle of their wine. Great prices. We were stuffed after that and didn't have room for the main course. We will definitely return the next time we are in the area. We have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. The food is always fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is really neat. You get to sit in an old house and eat at tables in the various rooms. The prices are very reasonable, especially the lunch specials. I love the chicken salad sandwich. I highly recommend this place."

Definitely recommend making reservations if it isn't an off-hour or you want to sit outside on warmer days as they do get crowded quickly! The same menu at Taco Bell tastes different because there's no standardization between franchises; items vary by region.[8] In addition: some locations may offer breakfast foods during late night hours while others only serve dinner[910]; nutritional facts can also be inconsistent from location within any single franchise chain [11]. This lack uniformity has been blamed for contributing towards childhood obesity,[12], especially when children buy fastfood meals more than once per week due its low price points that ""favor consumption over nutrition."" A 2012 report noted several ways companies have tried unifying their offerings across multiple channels including advertising campaigns touting national menus with standardized ingredients along other methods such implementing cooking classes into corporate policies which encourage healthier meal options among employees - however these changes tend meet resistance form local management teams who would prefer maintaining autonomy even though profits suffer without consistency under one unified concept throughout all stores online ordering programs available 247."

You can see this in a couple of different ways: or JohnBooty My personal experience is that the green leisure thing is ridiculous, but there's a lot of truth in the article's point about the problem with so many people working more than 40 hours a week. A huge amount of people's time is being spent working for other people, whether that's their bosses, the government, or the local shopping mall. It's so inefficient that I can't imagine why it has not been addressed by some genius at some point. The other problem is that many people do not have the option of working less than 40 hours a week. This is especially true in fields like medicine, law, and the arts. If I could work only 20 hours a week in a non-billable capacity, I would. ken I'm not sure it's just about the lack of time. When you're doing something that you love, it's fun. If you're working 40 hours a week at a job you hate, it's miserable. So I don't think the issue is necessarily time, but the enjoyment you get from your work. JohnBooty Absolutely. And it's not that people hate their jobs. People love their jobs. People just hate working for other people. alok-g I don't know how green leisure can be so successful.

It sounds to me like the old Soviet era of forced vacations and enforced work breaks. It's not a new idea, it's just the nature of society is changing. The reason it is successful is because it is successful. It makes for a happier society, more time to spend with loved ones, more time to enjoy your own life, and less money spent on travel. The downside is that it also puts a strain on the state to provide for those who have less free time, but that is more a problem of taxation than anything else."

I expected to be able to watch a UK game without a problem. To my surprise, when the game was about to start, they decided to turn the game off to show a concert on MTV. I know this bar is supposed to cater to the younger crowd, but I thought it was a given that during college football season, ESPN would be on. I guess not.

That's a buck more than most places in town. 4 for a PBR bottle. And 4 for a basket of fries. They're good fries, but not 4 good. I can get a burger and fries at O'Malley's for 5.

BigScience,yelp-37,"Harpers is good, when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night, with baked potato or sweet potato fries. I came by here on a Thursday and they had a prime rib dinner for 19 bucks before tax. I think that because we live in the suburbs now no matter where you go there are always so many options out there compared to what it was 25 years ago. We used to only have burgers places like Chick Fil A and McDonalds but when I'm trying something new or different that's not necessarily my favorite food but at least it's fun eating outside your comfort zone from time to time. A lot of people will tell me about their greatest memories dining out as kids. My dad would take us to Valley Cove Cafe every single day after school until he got married and moved away. He'd cook all our meals then we'd eat them while watching TV together. It meant a great deal to him because his mom left home right around this same age - 1415 years old - which also made sense since her job required long hours. My husband's best memory was going to Tito's Place with his family when he's little. The pizza was cooked up fresh to order so even though he said he didn't particularly enjoy it himself he knew that everyone else did! It's one thing for adults but those tiny tots who were eagerly awaiting their pizzas may still remember how much joy it brought! We went to Johnny Rockets once recently during a trip to Texas City. Had an awesome meal leaving happy (and jacked) enough for another round of drinks with friends!! Great tips!

LLAMA,yelp-37,"Harpers is good, when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night, with baked potato or sweet potato fries. I came by here on a Thursday night around 9pm, and was seated by the friendly host. It's a nice ambiance, but it's not as happening as it used to be. I miss the days when it used to be quite busy. In fact, it's been really quiet the last few times I came by here. I suppose it's because of the economy. Here's the thing about Harpers though, it's just never as good as the first time. I mean the first time, you try the prime rib and it's amazing. Then you come by again and it's not as good. The next time, it's not as good as the second time. The steak is a bit overcooked, and it's just missing something. And it's not that you think you're going to get the best steak of your life. I'm not saying you're going to get Ruth's Chris quality steak. But you just think you're going to get a decent steak, and it's not. The service is very slow too. It's like you get sat down, and you wait for 15 minutes for your server to come by. And then you try to order a cocktail and it takes 10 minutes for them to get that to you. Then your food takes another 20 minutes to come by. It's not that it's busy, because it's not. And you're the only table in the restaurant. I think I'm pretty much done with Harpers. Maybe if it's been a couple of years since I last came, I'll try it again. But I doubt I will. Labels: American, American Restaurants, Harpers Steakhouse, Huntington Beach, Orange County, Steak, Steakhouse You're right. It's not as good as it used to be. I've been going there for years. It's sad. The service is slow because it's a bar with a few tables in the back, and the bartenders also work as servers. We've been going there for over 20 years, and it has changed little. We love it! Actually the service is slow because the servers are incompetent. The place is in the middle of a huge recession and can't even afford to hire a decent waitstaff. Not to mention that they are losing customers like crazy because of the poor service and food. I don't know what the restaurant you are talking about is. I've been going to Harpers since it first opened in the early 80's. The service is always good, food excellent. The only problem I have is they don't have more tables, it's almost impossible to get in on weekends. Same as the above comments. Food has always been great and service always great.

Shinichi-San in Madison Shinichi-San, located in the Madison Airport, is known for their fresh, authentic Japanese food and their use of high-quality ingredients. The prices are relatively high for sushi, but the portions are enormous. I would say that it is worth it. I highly recommend their Wagyu toro. I've tried it a couple times and it is very flavorful. The fish is served with a variety of condiments, including soy sauce, wasabi, wasabi paste, ponzu sauce, miso sauce, and shichimi sauce. I think the shichimi sauce is the best part of the dish, and it's nice to have a selection of sauces to pick from. 3. Fuku in Madison Fuku is another Japanese restaurant in Madison. I have been there twice, and it's the kind of place that I would recommend to someone who has never had Japanese food before. The food is very simple and traditional, but the food is delicious. The owner is also friendly and very helpful. The restaurant is very clean, and they serve an assortment of sake. 4.

I have had some good meals at Blue Sushi, but I would say that it is a little pricey. 5. Zai Sushi in Madison Zai Sushi is a Japanese restaurant in Madison. The food is very good, but the portions are small. The restaurant is a little bit on the small side, but it's nice to be able to sit in the restaurant and have a nice meal. 6.

I like to order the Tome Roll, which is an assortment of a variety of vegetables, and then they wrap it in the seaweed. The sushi is good, but I think it's a little on the expensive side. I think it's worth it, but I would say that it's a little pricey. I have had a couple meals at Tome, and I have enjoyed them. 7. Yoshinoya in Madison Yoshinoya is a Japanese restaurant in Madison.

I bought the original AirPods with lightning ear tips, since they are thicker than regular ones, but when I'm listening to music through them, it makes a squeaking noise that is really annoying. The store manager was extremely rude and kept telling us we were wrong on some part of our order because she didn't have time to check everything out at once (and wouldn't take care anytime soon). She objected while taking items off her cart saying ""they're not ours"" before throwing them overboard for no good reason other then being too heavy or something like that. She tried all kinds of excuses in an attempt to get rid of what we'd ordered even though she had already checked out. It took about 5 times in total until finally one employee said we could leave if we wanted. The guy who did this business stuff seemed completely unconcerned by how long these people would have waited there considering he walked away as quickly as possible. We ended up leaving after trying to pay via credit card which sadly caused another delay because the employee still wasn't happy with anything we've got."

Nice price but I'd wait for 50 off... which I think is the usual price. I got mine from there in the spring and it was 50 off. Same for me. No key and no strap. I would be absolutely livid! It's a 1,000 bag! They did me the same thing. I couldn't find the key. And when I called the store they told me to check everywhere I may have lost it. When I finally found it, it wouldn't open the lock. They told me to send it back and they'd send me another one. I don't know what happened to the key I lost. I think I may have left it in the store. How did you get it fixed? I got my bag as a gift and have been using it for a couple months now but my key just broke and won't open the lock anymore. The store I bought it from has gone out of business so I'm wondering what I should do now. I've tried calling the actual Prada store but I can't get ahold of anyone. I was not happy to say the least. I purchased the bag at 11:30 am and called by 1:30 and was told to wait until tomorrow. They didn't even ask any questions or try to help me. I have a feeling if I had waited until tomorrow they would have tried to blame it on me but I wasn't going to take the blame for their mistake. I was surprised to see that they didn't tell me they didn't have the strap and key. I was also surprised that they didn't ask me to wait until tomorrow. I was told it would be there the next day and it was. If you still have the receipt and can prove the bag was purchased in store, I would take it to the Prada store and see if they can help you."

My wife had an appetizer called Wolf Tortoise. It tasted fine, but it did not look as nice looking as I thought it would be from what my friend told me about this particular dish. We got our main courses for dinner: chicken parm and tuna salad sandwich with tomato soup. Neither one of them looked that great either... And they didn't taste like much either! But we ate because there wasn't another option at the time."

Eleuther-AI,yelp-41,"I moved here from NY about three years ago and could not find a decent slice of pizza to save my life...until....I found Nicks! OMG! The best tasting and closest thing I have had in quite some time. It is the BEST place for thin crust, pepperoni or cheese!!! You need only try one pie there once!! It will be your new go-to spot if you are anywhere near Fairfield county Connecticut area!!!! Also it has great pies including veggie options as well which makes this amazing little gem even better:). People who love good foods should make sure they check out Kestrel because we speak like two languages (pizza talk) but get along really nicely;) lol"

When I got to the pizzeria, my order wasn't ready right away and I had such a nice conversation with the man working behind the counter (wasn't sure if it was the Nick). He apologized for making me wait (I honestly think I was early) and he was very friendly. The area to sit and eat-in in really teeny-tiny - maybe 5 4-seat tables so that could be a problem during the lunch rush. I will most definately be back. YUMMO!!!"

Please double check email before posting it to social media sites. This past weekend Mark I spent time in Cincinnati visiting his father-in-law. He was up north hunting deer most recently, but when he reached home he got ready to head over to see us again. We decided to take our kids along because he wanted to show them how much fun family vacations were like growing up - packing lunches instead of buying prepackaged deli foods, making sure everyone ate breakfast and getting pictures taken outside while having a picnic lunch on the lawn. Well, that's pretty normal stuff right? Except that we didn't go anywhere special or even eat at McDonalds every day; no duh. But hey, it's been nice being able to travel light lately! Monday morning we woke up and packed 3 suitcases full of clothes - 12 pairs of shoes, 4 hats AND 15 backpacks; bringing them downstairs took upwards of 30 minutes since we felt like pulling everything through the hallway, then folding those jackets on the floor, etc... Eventually, though, we came across a few things that just weren't necessary anymore such as slippers for walking around town in downtown, socks, pajamas and towels. Yes, our first handy: the hotel gift card checkout window closed early due to holiday celebrations, well, Christmas Eve in particular. So thankfully we made it all work! After leaving the house we drove to Garland Mall on Westheimer to grab some groceries, get gas and pick up some more clothing (we actually ended up at Target). Then it was onto Kroger to stock up on snacks and drinks for later in the afternoon. There wasn't really anything happening until mid-afternoon except maybe Stetson for children's shoes who asked us several times why we bought her shoes rather than flip flops....and she loved the new ones so much she wore them 7 hours straight before I finally told her I should pull them off now since you're sneezing a lot."

Tsinghua,yelp-42,"Incompetent manager that wasn't able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another card....luckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service sucks. Great for quick lunch. I'm not a fan of fast food but it's cheap, fast, and clean. We get takeout orders and I take them to my work and bring it in. I don't mind eating fast food for lunch because the quality of fast food is generally high. The only negative thing about this restaurant is that I get a lot of people telling me that they want to go here but can't because it's too far. I've always said that if it was close to my work I'd eat here more often. Friendly staff and food is fast and good. Throw away the crappy ads that say ""taste of Texas."" Their food is good, but nothing like Texas. The fries are average and their drinks are too expensive. This place has really improved over the past few years. They used to have very poor service and horrible food. I have noticed an improvement over the past few years. Their food is still very good, but they need to improve on their service. They should do a better job of making sure they are in tune with what is happening in the kitchen. They are the only fast food restaurant that is located in my neighborhood, so I do have to go there a lot. The fries are not as crisp as other fast food places, but they are still very good. The fries have a nice saltiness to them. The overall food is really good, but the service is still the same. Their fries are really good, but the service is poor. The manager is terrible. They don't take orders quickly enough, and the fries take too long to come out. I would give this place a 5 if the fries were faster. The service is still poor, but the food is good. I don't mind paying for the fries and the fact that it is close to my work. I am going to go back for the fries. The food is not good. The fries are really greasy, and there is no taste to them. I ordered a burger and the bun was soggy and there was no taste to the burger. I don't mind paying for the fries, but I'm not going to go back for the food. Their fries are really good, but their food is not as good as other fast food places. They have had the same fries for a while now and they have gotten really greasy. I would go back for the fries, but I don't think I will go back for the food. I go here a lot because it's close to my work. The fries are really good, but the food is really bad. The manager is not very good at making the food taste better. The food is very greasy, and it tastes like crap. The fries are the only good thing about this place."
OpenAI,yelp-42,"Incompetent manager that wasn't able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another card....luckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service can be lacking at times. But let's focus on finding a solution to the problem at hand. First, we need to determine why the manager was not able to cancel the order on one card and place it on another. Was there a technical issue with the system? Did the manager not have the proper authorization to make the change? Once we know the root of the problem, we can address it and find a solution. In the meantime, we can try a few things to help resolve the issue. First, we can suggest that the customer call their credit card company to dispute the charges on the original card. This may take some time, but it will ensure that the customer is not charged twice for the same order. Secondly, we can encourage the manager to escalate the issue to their superiors and work towards finding a solution that satisfies the customer. This may involve a refund or a credit to the customer's account. Overall, it is important to communicate with the customer and keep them updated on the progress of resolving the issue. We can apologize for any inconveniences and reassure them that we're working towards a satisfying resolution."

LLAMA,yelp-45,"Worst dentist ever!!! Too many giggly stupid girls working there and not knowing what they are doing! Over charging customers and not caring about people in pain! Place should be shut down! I had 2 extractions and was in need of emergency dental care. The staff were so friendly and understanding, and my dentist was very gentle and professional. I will be back to have my remaining wisdom teeth removed as well. Great experience! I wish I could give this place less than one star. I have spent 5000 in a year and a half on dental work. My teeth are still messed up. Today I went in to get a 2nd opinion on a crown that had fallen out, and they are telling me I need to get 3 more crowns. When I asked how they could fall out so quickly when they are 20 years old, I was told I grind my teeth (not true) and to see a psychiatrist. I asked about my back molars, which they had previously said needed crowns, and today I was told they need to be pulled. I asked why they weren't pulled the first time they told me they needed to be pulled, and I was told ""It doesn't work like that."" I asked for a 2nd opinion on the crown, and I was told they don't do that. I asked if they were telling me to go to another dentist, and I was told yes. I was then told I needed to pay 400 to see a ""specialist"" to determine if the crown could be saved or if I needed to have it pulled. Then I was asked if I wanted to have the teeth pulled for 3000. I said no. I then asked about another crown that was falling out, and I was told I should get a 2nd opinion and to see a psychiatrist because I grind my teeth (again, not true). I asked how I could afford to get all of this done, and I was told to ask my husband. I have never been so appalled and insulted by a dentist office in my life. If you are looking for a dentist, do not go here. You will just end up paying tons of money for nothing. My first visit. I was very impressed. The staff was very nice and friendly. I was made to feel comfortable and not judged. Easy to schedule appointments. Flexible with appointments. Knowledgeable and professional. I have never had a bad experience at Dental Works. The staff is very friendly and professional. I would recommend them to anyone. I love Dental Works. They are very friendly and treat you like family. They even remember the little details about you when you come in for your appointment. I have been going to Dental Works for many years. I have never had a bad experience. Everyone is very nice and professional. I have been going to this office for over 10 years. I love it. The staff is very friendly. They are also very professional.

Place should be shut down! Stay away from this place, don't waste your money! Avoid this place if you can. I went to this dentist a few years ago for a simple toothache. He did not seem to care and proceeded to work on a tooth that I had previously filled. He could not get the filling to seat properly. After about 15 minutes, I left the office. I was so upset. I called a friend of mine who was a dentist. He told me that this was not the case. I did not have a cavity in the tooth, I had a crown. I was so angry and hurt that he would work on a crown and I would not have been told. I will never go back to this dentist and will never recommend this dentist to anyone."

When finally someone picked up, it was impossible to get through because there was a lot of noise and background chatter going on. The hygienists just kept asking me if I wanted a filling done or anything else, even though I told them that I only needed a cleaning - not fillings at this point. (To tell you the truth, I'm too old for fillings anyway.) Anyway...the other dental professional who came out instead said she would like to take over from her supervisor until another one could come in! (That's very common practice here.) So now she's telling me why it's taking so long...what's wrong with the tooth? How do I know what's causing the nerve damage?! So then she says ""well you're under age"" by which time I've been waiting 1 12 hours already! It's ridiculous."

If you want to go swimming, then there's no way that pool can be accessed from this entrance and most people end up going in through one door (entrance near Sears) or another front gate with 6 elevators which gets them closer but still makes it hard at times... This was my first time staying here so I really wasn't expecting much except maybe better quality as they are part owned by Marriott group after all..

Our visit to this restaurant was unexpected, as we were out on Thursday night. As usual, vegans everywhere had been telling us about Falafel Resto so when we saw they posted their menu online I thought I'd take advantage of that information! We paid 24 per person which included salads: We ordered some falafels (11), a pita wrap with hummus (5) and vegetable samosas (3). Both our choices came quickly so no wait time at all! I think these wraps need to be called ""wraps"" because while you can put whatever fillings you like into them there still isn't much space left over for vegetables or yogurtcheese dressing etc. Not sure if that's just me though - things seemed fine without anything in them!!! So not great considering the price point however maybe try something else next time? Tried some fried rice last week and loved it.

LLAMA,yelp-49,"The service is pretty darn good. The wine selection is always top notch.... but they lost me on the food! Understand, I have frequented this place since we moved into the neighborhood 4 years ago. The food was always very good, and we would eat there 1-2 times a month. Lately, the quality of the food has gone down hill. We went in for our anniversary, and ordered a few dishes that we have ordered in the past. The food tasted great, but was extremely over priced, and we didn't get a lot of food for the price. For example, we ordered a salad for 8.00, and got 12 a plate of lettuce, tomatoes, and some olives with a little tuna fish. In the past, this was a huge salad, with a huge amount of tuna. This time, we got a small portion of tuna. I could have gotten a better salad at a fast food restaurant. They also had a special of a meatball and pasta for 15.00. We ordered it, and got a plate with a few meatballs, and a few noodles. I could have made this dish, with a better quality of meat at home for 4.00. When it came time for dessert, we ordered the canoli, and got a very small canoli, with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. The canoli wasn't even filled with a fresh filling! It was clearly made from a can, and in the past, they made the canoli from scratch. The price of the canoli has gone up to 8.00, but the quality has gone down, and we got a very small portion. Needless to say, we will not be going back. If you are looking for a great glass of wine, this is the place to go. If you are looking for good Italian food, this is not the place to go.

Second attempt at mushroom ravioli with house made sausage - same thing again NO CHEESE IN SIGHT!!! Just plain old pasta filling.. No sauce as well which probably would've helped some too because there were wayyyy more noodles than anything else inside those skins!! Third visit for bruschetta salad chicken fettuccine Alfredo both recipes from their website??? Not sure what happened here guys?? Fourth trip came when our server told my husband ""don' ""t worry about your wife she'll eat just say yes...""so he said ok then ended up eating half his entree before noticing all her amazing creations sitting right next him looking like poison candy lolol.....

My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not be in a huge crowd at the concert. The hotel is right across the street from the Cowboy Stadium, the park, and the arena. We were very impressed with the room. Extremely clean and spacious. Very comfortable beds and pillows. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the arena and stadium. This is a 5 star hotel. The rooms are very spacious, very clean, the staff is very friendly, and the service is excellent. The food at the hotel is excellent as well. There are a few restaurants on site but also a grocery store and restaurants nearby. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice stay in Arlington.

PaLM,yelp-50,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have to deal with traffic and parking. The hotel is only about a mile from the arena, but the light rail is right outside the front door, making it an easy commute. The room was nice and clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. The only downside is that the hotel is a bit noisy, especially if your room is facing the street. But overall, we had a great experience."
Human,yelp-50,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have to fight traffic so we chose the Radisson. Check in was a breeze and the front desk clerk upgraded our rooms to Cabana suites...free of charge. Once again the room was extremely clean and had been recently updated. Brian down in the bar was great for happy hour..and he has a heavy pour. Check out the happy hour specials, they have a list of specialty martinis for 5. We love this location, sure it's off the beaten path and across the street from an adult bookstore but everyone is always friendly and pleasant and the property is taken care of and the best part it's 2 blocks from a light rail station. Catch it and enjoy a concert or sporting event downtown without the hassle or cost of parking."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-50,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have a long drive over there in rush hour traffic so we stayed at this hotel on July 4th weekend; it worked out well for us! The property is very clean, nice staff who were always happy smiling:) Will definitely be back if ever need another place near downtown area as you can walk right from your room up main street or lite...

BigScience,yelp-50,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not be too far from it, so we stayed at this hotel for only a night before our next flight home. It was very clean comfortable! We were near some great restaurants!! The staff is friendly helpful if you have any questions! This place has really good reviews in all aspects but it does cost more than most places on my list which gives it an advantage that other hotels don't. The location went perfect with us being able easily walk to Disneyland and the Port Orleans Resort. The room itself is large enough to accommodate 4 adults comfortably. There are 3 bathrooms including one on each floor making everything accessible without getting up stairs or having to drag stuff around outside (not bad). This property also features a fitness center which made staying active easy after enjoying Disney and shopping during our stay My mother-in-law's birthday present when she was 70 years old was going to stay overnight since she doesn't drive. She loved the Hilton Grand Vacations West Palm Beach Hotel. Her rooms looked exactly like they do online; big bed, lots of storage space, privacy curtains, TV, etc., etc.. She enjoyed swimming pool, gym, breakfast buffet area, valet parking garage, dog park areasall close by her suite except the casino. They provided free transfers tofrom the airport - we used Uber as well just to get out of carpark and about town whenever needed. For my wife's purposeful trip there, however, I would recommend looking into the Plaza Suites Orlando Airport location. It's further away from downtown Tampa then the Hilton but less expensive, closer to discount stores, shops, movie theater,etc. And it's got its own entrance onto public transportation routesbuses with no need to cross busy street traffic where many people tend to look down their nose at strangers and pick them apart while driving errant cars. We spent two nights at the Holiday Inn Express located right off of Interstate 75 South. Although the service wasn't overly impressive upon arrival, one day later it became apparent why this particular hotel gets such high scores among others: the resort-style style pool provides unobstructed views of both the highway and neighboring homes. Also noteworthy is the availability of a laundry facility for guests who didn't want to bring suitcases back and forth twice per day to use a nearby laundromat, unlike what I've experienced at other properties. Having said that, another perk worth noting about the hotel is how quickly your checked-in baggage can leave once you've left the premises due to increased security related to the pandemic. In short, between these characteristics, plus the convenient proximity to major highways and attractions in general, I'd definitely consider returning there. I liked the layout of the building, especially compared to Marriotts location near my office. Parking lot is quite wide, giving me plenty of room to maneuver into spot even though I'm 6'2"" tall. One thing I didnt care for was the amenities. While it may seem like the normal standard, there were things missing rather oddly; e.g., coffee maker had no cups nor enough water, fridge separate compartments could make ice cubes in half the time it took to freeze a container, pillow top mattress felt cheap quality material. But that's usually expected given budget motels. New construction meant new fixtures and fresh paint jobs; hopefully that will last longer than usual."

We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and comfort of the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, providing suggestions for places to eat and things to do in the area.

Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to others looking for a convenient and comfortable option in the area. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
LLAMA,yelp-50,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not worry about driving. The hotel is very conveniently located to the light rail, but not a convenient walk to downtown. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the rail and then about 20 minutes on the rail to get to downtown. It was a little frustrating when we came back after midnight and we were on the last rail car and had to walk the length of the train to get to the exit. The hotel is fine, but nothing fancy. It was clean and our room was quiet. The staff was friendly and the front desk ladies were super helpful. We had a little trouble with the key cards and they took care of it very quickly. We were on the 2nd floor and the rooms were very quiet. We had one issue with the toilet running, but that was quickly fixed by the maintenance man. We will stay here again, because of the convenience of the light rail."

He cared and treated for my guinea pig, Nibbles, for 3 weeks after she was diagnosed with cancer and did everything possible to help her get better. He never gave up on her, even when things looked bleak. He was always available to answer my questions and concerns, and he made sure that I was fully informed about Nibbles' condition and treatment options. He is a truly gifted veterinarian and I am so grateful that he was there for Nibbles and me during this difficult time."
BigScience,yelp-51,"Dr. C. is THE. BEST. VET. EVER!! He is the most compassionate, wonderful vet I have ever met. He cared and treated for my guinea pig, Nibbles, for 3 weeks before she passed away of a non-lethal congenital heart defect that was not found until after her passing (she had all of her shots up to date). If you are looking for an honest and professional veterinarian who treats your pets with dignity then Dr. C. is your guy. I love this place! They make sure everyone in my family feels comfortable when we come in there. The staff always has me feeling welcome! We got our first puppy from American Veterinary Specialists its been such a great experience....from getting started on selecting one out of so many different breeds to bringing him home. We experienced some problems but they worked them out quickly. The people at AMS are very knowledgable about the dogs also...and their products too..we can't say enough good things about these guys!!! The doctorsassociates that help care for us were amazing!!! This practice really cares about animals and the community Our cat has gone through three vets over the last 20 years, two private practitioners as well as an official hospital, we were told it would be impossible to save his life or find any answers right now due to age - never once did he complain during those appointments thus far- yet today here at AVS he said farewell after 2 12 months battling cancer. Thank You so much Dr. Crapo for giving us hope again even if only temporarily. This will by no means look like other blogs I've written. So, please don't judge what I'm going to talk about based off the title alone because that's not how it's gonna go down. I've wanted to write something since last year, probably closer to August where I sat down staring blankly into space trying to figure out why people continue to believe everything Hollywood tells them instead of being smart enough to do research for themselves regarding anything. So here's what's coming next: It's called ""The Chocolate Puff"" or ""Chocolatier's Doomday"" and oh boy am I excited. Aside from sharing stories about fun times, bad experiences and general experiences in my travels around the world, I'll venture onto some more obscure topics including stuff about science and technology that you're bound to never hear anywhere else besides my blog. I'm not saying I'm smarter than anyone else especially when I resort back to Google every time I want to learn more information whatsoever related to whatever topic I'm writing about; however, I'm pretty certain you'll see plenty of new ideas popping up without having to rely solely upon YouTube videos and quacks everywhere. For example, let's take the case of vaccines, which are deemed necessary worldwide. How can someone ensure they're receiving proper vaccinations? What exactly does it mean when you get ""one dose"" versus ""two doses""; ""dox"" versus ""double x""? My answer is simple: There isn't any simple formula dictating what each vaccine must entail nor should there be given the fact that each person reacts differently depending incredibly closely on whether they've already received previous immunizations prior to getting another particular shot or injection. Yes, there's the honesty factor involved...isn't that just one big difference between fake news and real journalism? Isn't showing dishonest behaviors completely unacceptable regardless of where you live?... Unfortunately, though, nowadays the line between truth and fiction simply disappears whenever you turn online...no matter how authorities try to portray otherwise. Many viewers may question the validity of my perspective considering that Facebook itself recently reported the existence of Russian bots purporting to have millions of followers across numerous ""social media pages"" claiming to represent actual politicians' accounts. After licking their chops, Americans elected Donald Trump despite proven evidence indicating the opposite... Maybe for you it's easy to dismiss everything and call me crazy because you're blindly believing precisely what Sony Pictures, Disney World, HBO Films, CNN International, News affiliates, Fox NewsNewsmax TV channels, Reuters mainstream broadcast outlets and others constantly tell you: either ""the buck stops"" if you're part of the herd mentality or ""you've lost your mind"" immediately if you refuse to embrace bullshit propaganda spewed by corporate entities across multiple levels using almost identical rationale whenever confronted with facts contrary to standard narrative presented by the ""mainstream..."" In short, I could digress forever and explain why everything FIFA Soccer is meant to create negative impact on society andor environment while simultaneously suggesting ways individuals can prevent their fair share of damage resulting directly from playing video games against computer-controlled opponents. In reality though, what I'm interested in doing is answering important questions like: Why do kids spend hours surfing the internet searching for book recommendations whereas adults seem concerned more about spending money buying game consoles, computers, televisions, phones, tablets, cameras,... As it turns out, Playstation 4 sales jumped 139 past Xbox One ahead of the holiday season according to industry figures released earlier this week. What causes Millennials to prefer Nintendo Switch over PS4 or X Box Series SX compared to older generations who tend to focus on PC gaming systems? If you've stayed tuned lately, chances are you'd already heard about ""Pinoys Are Dumb"" meme we've"

PROS: Tres Leches chocolate cake Chorizo and clams Great place for a group to try many different dishes. Ribeye Steak and truffle fries (entree) CONS: Spicy Beef salad - the salsa verde didn't mix with the other ingredients Pulpo Asado - the octopus was good but the tomato, paprika lemon vinaigrette didn't mix.

The food took a little longer to come out then expected. I ordered the chicken marsala with a house salad. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The pasta and sauce were great as well. It was not overpowering and it was a great portion. My sister ordered the shrimp scampi with rice and broccoli. She commented that the shrimp and sauce were great, but the rice was not. She said it had no flavor at all. She did like the size of the shrimp and the amount of shrimp. The waitress was friendly and attentive. She always checked in to see if we needed anything. I would recommend the restaurant for a great Italian dinner. The atmosphere of the restaurant was welcoming and comfortable. They had a bar area and plenty of seating in the dining room."

I've been staring at the door, willing it to open and my food to appear. But no such luck. I'm starting to think that the server forgot about me. Or maybe they're just messing with me. Either way, it's not cool. I'm so hungry that I'm starting to hallucinate. I can see my sushi in my mind. It's so delicious and fresh. I can almost taste the soy sauce and the wasabi. But it's just a hallucination. My sushi is still nowhere to be found. I'm starting to lose hope. I'm about to give up and just leave. But then I remember how much I love sushi. And I know that I can't give up without at least trying one bite. So I wait. And I wait. And I wait. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the door opens and the server walks in. She's carrying my sushi! I can't believe it! My sushi is finally here! I quickly grab my chopsticks and start eating. The sushi is even better than I imagined. It's so delicious that I forget all about my anger. I eat every bite of my sushi and then I ask for more. The server smiles and says, ""Of course. We always make extra for people like you."" I'm so happy that I finally got my sushi. And I'm even happier that I didn't give up. The moral of the story is that if you want something bad enough, you should never give up.

Human,yelp-53,"SUSHI Waaheres my order? Sushi wa-s the server ever gonna take an order? Sushi wa-it. Sushi wa-tttt theee FUCK?! Im sitting in bamboo jail as I write with all the Yelpers here for a UYE. We started at 6pm, it is now 8:50pm as I start this review and we are sitting waiting on them transacting everyone out. Food is still decent, however service is rude and inefficient from our main server. One half of the table was getting service and the other half where I was sitting was kinda ignored a lot more, waited more to put orders, etc. He'd take their order, leave, come back with something for them and then we would have to try to flag him. We'd wave him, he'd say he'll be back and doesn't come back to us or he would walk passed us like we didn't wave at all. A few people had lost orders and instead of saying something kind like sorry, let me go check on that and get it out....it's more of remarks like we never put the order, you got it (no someone else got it),etc. One of our Yelpers asked three times to get her first order when the other side already on their 2nd round of orders. I was gonna do 3 stars but now with tge transactions, I'm miffed. First, they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it because they're busy. We computed what we all owe and wrote in the back which cards to charge what. Now something with POS being the only one for orders and transactions so they don't want to back up orders by transacting all us out so they'll transact when orders aren't coming in. We had a Korean speaking Yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manager who said he will do it in a bit. We had to wait for him and explain everything. It took like 20 minutes of discussing things and explaining how we wrote down what before they went to the back to start. We have no choice but to wait. I'm sorry, but one thing I learned about restaurant hospitality that turnover is important because waiting for a check lowers the impression farther than waiting a bit for good food. People are done and want to just go. We finally got our receipts back and...... they charge my credit card for two drinks and two AYCE. We wrote everything down clearly on the back on to receipt. We put the last 4 digits of each card to identify them and what amount to charge to each card. HOW is that NOT clear enough? They charged me for someone else. Okay, so basically then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash people some change. Well, first time they not only gave me less than what I was owed, but also no change for people with cash. They finally gave it and we left at 9:40pm. 50 minutes to transact is pretty crazy long. I know it's easy to say that well, it's a pretty a-typical effed up situation. That maybe with the busy place and a waitstaff that doesn't micromanage it well it went down south fast. However, I do have previous visits where I do specifically state how odd the service was odd, not friend and inefficient so that holds true that the waiter service isn't that good here. Also, it got super busy on my last visit towards the end of my dinner and I also waited 20 minutes to get a mochi and 15 minutes more to get my check back to sign so I was held hostage prior to this. So no, it can happen to you in some degree. Please retrain the staff....and HIRE some good servers. The busboy was polite and did more than just remove plates by checking orders and refilling drinks. PLEASE make him a server and maybe make your rude server a busboy until he learns how to talk to people. I don't deny the AYCE is good, but if you go then don't go at peak hours, don't sit at a table- ONLY with the nice sushi bar guys and do cash if you have a party splitting the check. Look at how thorough I was in taking pictures and reviewing individual items because I wanted people to come with my last review. However after this incident I am not recommending it or coming back. I was frustrated all throughout the meal and exasperated at how I was charged and then shortchanged cashback. I haven't felt this way about a dining experience in a long time so 1 star isn't out of line. There are many AYCE areas in the area including my favorite, Island Sushi whose staff is pure aloha hospitality. Update- Owner sent a apologetic note....I give him kudos for that and would've given a star for his professionalism. Then a week later I get a anonymous note from someone in henderson talking about me giving bad reviews and how dare I destroy families. Given that I only have 15 1 star reviews out of nearly 500 and havent given a bad review in ages, it made me wonder. Then I found out other people got the same message that dined with me here so it doesn't take two to figure out our crabby server didn't like what we said. SO unprofessional and cowardly! Your server really made sure we don't come back."

PaLM,yelp-54,"Food: Ginza offers traditional Japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles, with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well. We started with the miso soup, which was just the right amount of salty and flavorful. The gyoza were also delicious, with a perfectly crispy exterior and a juicy filling. For our main course, we had the sushi and sashimi combo, which was fresh and absolutely amazing. The tuna was so tender and the salmon was perfectly seasoned. We also had the teppanyaki, which was cooked right at our table and was incredibly flavorful. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very cozy and inviting. We would definitely recommend Ginza to anyone looking for a great Japanese dining experience. Here is a more detailed review of the food at Ginza:  Miso soup: The miso soup was flavorful and well-balanced. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the miso paste was not too salty. The tofu was soft and the wakame seaweed was fresh and crisp.  Gyoza: The gyoza were perfectly cooked. The wrappers were thin and crispy, and the filling was juicy and flavorful. The gyoza were served with a dipping sauce that was made with soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil.  Sushi and sashimi combo: The sushi and sashimi combo was fresh and delicious. The sushi was made with high-quality fish, and the sashimi was incredibly tender. The nigiri sushi was my favorite, and I especially enjoyed the salmon and tuna nigiri. The sashimi was also excellent, and I loved the way the fatty tuna melted in my mouth.  Teppanyaki: The teppanyaki was cooked right at our table and was incredibly flavorful. The chef cooked the meat and vegetables to perfection, and the rice was perfectly cooked. The teppanyaki was served with a variety of sauces, and I especially enjoyed the ponzu sauce and the teriyaki sauce. Overall, the food at Ginza was excellent. The dishes were all fresh and flavorful, and the service was impeccable. I would highly recommend Ginza to anyone looking for a great Japanese dining experience."

We started with the miso soup, which was just as good as it always is. Then for our entrees we had a spicy tuna roll and a salmon sashimi salad. Both were excellent. Service: Our waiter was pretty attentive, making sure to fill our glasses with water and quickly bring our food out. Atmosphere: If you like sushi, you will like this place. A lot of the decor is similar to other sushi places, but the lighting is a little darker than some others. The sushi bar is usually the center of attention, and the hibachi table sits in the back. Overall: A solid sushi place that doesn't disappoint. If you are looking for a night out for sushi, this is a good place to start."

We started with the miso soup, which was just a little too salty for my taste but very filling nonetheless! I also had some fried shrimp that were delicious - though we all agreed they could've been cooked slightly longer so their batter wasn't quite burnt by time it came out on our plates...but no big deal here; you know how sometimes food is better when its done quick? Well if your local restaurant doesn't do things fast enough then perhaps take-out would be more beneficial in this case;) We ordered what felt like 8 different dishes (or maybe half those numbers haha) including teriyaki chicken skewers - these really hit home since K loves them!! He even commented after he finished his first bite ""Oh wow im full!"":) Alongside other items such omelettes made fresh while sitting at table or mochi ice cream dessert sandwiches everybody enjoyed themselves immensely between eating each dish one right away before moving onto another..because why not?!:D Though everyone except me left pretty satisfied overall because apparently i've only ever eaten 1 bowl worth lolol!!!

We started with the miso soup, which was just the right amount of spicy. We then tried the nigiri and sashimi and it was all delicious. Next, we moved on to the appetizers. They had a wide variety of choices, from cold seafood to hot crab, and we tried them all. The desserts were fantastic as well. We had chocolate mousse, mochi ice cream, and mochi rice cakes. The restaurant also had a few traditional Japanese drinks that were all delicious. Overall, this was a very tasty meal and one that we will definitely be returning to.

The dessert - pineapple cheesecake bento box filled with a crispy coating made out of sugar paste on top- is incredibly delectable. The large platter also comes complete with juicy strawberries. Ginza has an extensive wine list that will please even the most discerning palate. I had one glass each of Carpe Diem (24) and Cuvee Louis Latour Reserve Chardonnay (US 26), both brought straight from France. To round off my meal, we split a bottle of La Cave De Luxe 2009 Pinot Noir (US 30). All in all, this experience exceeded expectation."
Human,yelp-54,"Food: Ginza offers traditional Japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles, with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well. We started with the miso soup, which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night. We followed with the edamame appetizer. Its hard to mess up edamame, and Ginza definitely didn't, but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average dish stand out. There were other interesting appetizer choices, like seaweed salad, fresh spring rolls, and avocado salad, all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame. We then ordered the vegetable sushi roll, which contained avocado, asparagus, and cucumber (any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll). The roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made. There were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu; tofu vegetable teriyaki, tofu tempura, vegetable hibachi, and vegetable udon noodles. The udon noodles can be prepared pan-fried or in broth soup-style. The pan-fried udon noodles were quite bland, covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice. The tofu teriyaki was slightly more interesting, with a thicker, more tasty sauce, but wasn't anything memorable and some of the vegetables were cold on the inside. The tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside. Ginza does not put any hot sauce, pepper seeds, or chili paste on the table, and also do not offer a spiciness scale, so you can't really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor. The lead-ins to the main course were not bad but not great, and the entrees were pretty lackluster. Overall, it seems as if Ginza doesn't have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items. Meat and fish eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying. Price: The prices were very reasonable, as we ordered two soups, an appetizer, a sushi roll, and two entrees for under 30. We were hungry, so we didn't have enough left to bring home (although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor), but the portion sizes are above average. Drinks: Ginza is BYOB but they do offer Japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks. Atmosphere: The restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit tables. There are tables for small and large parties, and enough space so that you aren't sitting directly on top of your neighbors. However, the restaurant is basically one big room and when the door opens on a cold night, you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are anywhere near the front. It isn't too difficult to find a parking spot on Liberty or one of its side streets. Service: We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, often checking our table and re-filling our water. We requested an addition of tofu to the udon noodles, which the waitress approved, but when the plate came the tofu was missing. We were also served our appetizer, sushi, and entrees within five minutes of each other, creating a table full of hot food getting cold.: cheap prices, large portions: average to below-average vegetarian food Would I go back again? Probably not, although I wouldn't stop a meat-eating friend from giving Ginza a shot."

It came with fried rice, grilled vegetables, and a delicious ginger soy sauce. We also tried a few sushi rolls, including the spicy tuna roll and the California roll, which were both fresh and flavorful. The noodles were also a hit, with the udon noodles being a stand-out dish. To cap off the meal, we enjoyed a few desserts including the green tea ice cream and the mochi balls. The overall experience at Ginza was fantastic, with attentive service and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming environment. It's definitely a spot we'll be returning to."

It turns out that all 4 tires are flat and even though there was no damage or anything else wrong with them just starting to puncture quickly we couldn't drive any further until someone came over to see what happened. He got us back on the road and told us how much easier it would be if only they lived closer! Overall good experience! I stopped here after traveling across state line to get an oil change done.

BigScience,yelp-56,"Just walk away. While my specific waitress was doing her job everyone else was clearly slacking. The food was bad even for a chain, and the worst part might have just been that I had no idea what it tasted like. I gave up on this place so am not at all surprised by your experience. They do get good reviews but as long as nothing drastic has changed they should be fine with their current staffing level. At least you got to eat some real food! Any restaurant can end up with mishaps when things go wrong due to human error or negligence, especially if people are new to the restaurant's workforce - or they're under pressure from more senior employees who expect them to deliver results quickly while minimizing needless hassles (in other words...patronage). I've worked in restaurants before where management didn't take kindly to being told something wasn't going right unless there were blatant major problems with service or dishes; I think it's perfectly normal to ask why certain aspects of dining quality aren't working out well andor how to fix them. It's important to keep an open mind about a restaurant that's delivering mediocre experience overall because sometimes the problem is that somewhere along the process someone didn't follow proper procedures correctly, mistakes were made, or one particular dish maybe too hotcoldnot properly cooked etc... But don't feel pressured either way! Restaurant managers know exactly what needs to happen to make sure diners leave happy!! Be patient and show interest: ""Why won't X plated Y?"" Sorry you're having such a negative experience. Food doesn't taste horrible. And I'm glad you asked the question (and took time!) It shows a willingness to look forward to learning. Management knows how much effort goes into preparing every single meal, including cleaning stations between shifts. If customers want clean tables after each shift (which we encourage), then our servers are expected to check each table behind me regularly during the course of a night (usually once per hour). If any server considers themselves uninterested, rude, lazy, apathetic, disorganized or otherwise unsatisfied with serving guests, please let us know immediately.

OpenAI,yelp-56,"Just walk away. While my specific waitress was doing her job everyone else was clearly slacking. The food was bad even for a chain, and the worst part might have been the service. I apologize for the negative experience you had at the restaurant. It sounds like there were several errors made on multiple levels, which can be frustrating as a customer. If you feel comfortable, it may be worth reaching out to the restaurant's management to share your feedback in a constructive manner. They may be able to take your concerns into account and make necessary improvements to their service and food quality. It's also possible that they may offer some form of compensation, such as a refund or a voucher for future visits, as a gesture of goodwill. In the future, if you are unhappy with the service or meal at a restaurant, it's always a good idea to address the issue with the staff or management at the time instead of waiting until later. They may be able to rectify the situation or offer solutions, which can improve your dining experience overall."

PaLM,yelp-58,"Awesome. This place has awesome BBQ. It's really busy all the time so I recommend getting there early. The portions are way to big but you get to try everything. I've tried the ribs, the brisket, and the chicken. The ribs are fall off the bone tender and the brisket is so juicy and flavorful. The chicken is also really good, but it's a little dry compared to the other two meats. The sides are all great too. I especially like the mac and cheese and the cornbread. The service is friendly and attentive. The prices are a little high, but it's worth it for the quality of food. Overall, this is a great place to get some good BBQ."
Human,yelp-58,Awesome. This place has awesome BBQ. It's really busy all the time so I recommend getting there early. The portions are way to big but you get to try everything. The pimento cheese fries rock and you don't need the meat on them unless you want to into a food coma before dinner. I was surprised that the brisket was so well cooked. They obviously take their time making it because it's really tender. They have a large beer selection supporting the local Charlotte breweries among others. Service was fast and they have a knowledgeable wait staff. I also have ordered their bulk to-go food for parties and was not disappointed except for the kitchen manager who was kind of a jerk on the phone.

They're also open 247 which is nice if you're a night owl like me. I'm just kidding, who would believe that anyone could be diabetic in this day and age? But it seems true. I was born in the 1980's where diabetes wasn't even an issue yet; it's almost impossible for someone my age not to have had Type 1 or 2. (My mom didn't develop type one until she turned 60).

OpenAI,yelp-59,"We went here for a girls night out dinner. We ordered 4 different dishes and all of us commented that all of our dishes were very salty (sea bass, duck, pasta, and salad). What might have caused this and what should we do? There could be a few reasons why the dishes were salty. It is possible that the chef oversalted the dishes, or that the ingredients used were already naturally salty. Another possibility could be that the dishes were left to cook too long, causing the flavors to concentrate and resulting in a saltier taste. To address this issue, you can bring it to the attention of the server or the manager. Explain the situation and express your concerns politely. They may offer to remake the dishes or adjust the seasoning in the kitchen. Alternatively, they may offer you a discount or a complimentary dessert to make up for the unsatisfactory experience. It's important to communicate your feedback effectively so that the restaurant can improve and ensure a better dining experience for future customers."
Tsinghua,yelp-59,"We went here for a girls night out dinner. We ordered 4 different dishes and all of us commented that all of our dishes were very salty (sea bass, duck, fish and risotto). We also all commented that the portions were very small and our risotto was extremely watery. We left our waitress a nice tip and also left her a nice note explaining our comments. They came back and asked us what we thought. We told them and they said they would make the risotto better and that they would call us back with a refund. It has been 2 weeks and we still have not heard back from them. I really do not think they deserve a refund because they clearly did not care about what we thought. I have called their corporate office and left a message and I will call again next week. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. They are horrible to deal with and they will do nothing to make things right. We went to La Cucina for dinner and the food was mediocre at best. I was not impressed with the menu, the service was indifferent at best, and the food was overpriced. There were also a lot of dishes we did not order that we would have liked. The best part of the evening was the bartender. She was very friendly and fun to be around. If you want to go to this restaurant, do so for the bartender. The dinner menu is very limited, but if you want to eat there, you might as well order the wine list. If you do, they will let you taste the wines before you decide. I had 2 bottles of wine, and I loved both of them. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends. If you have a special occasion coming up, I would recommend you order from the wine list. You will be surprised at how good they are. My husband and I were having a quiet dinner at La Cucina. We both had a bottle of Prosecco and we were treated very well by the staff. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good and the pasta was perfect. The owner was also there and he was very friendly. The restaurant was beautiful and the service was exceptional. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I had the risotto primavera and it was the best risotto I've ever had. I was impressed with the quality of the food. I will definitely go back. The restaurant is lovely, but they don't have a lot of room. The service was quick and friendly. The food was delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. I had the pasta primavera and it was delicious. It was served with the most amazing garlic bread that I have ever had. The sauce was flavorful and it was served with 2 types of bread. The portions were huge. The owners are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends. I had the steak and the risotto. The risotto was absolutely delicious. I have been to other risotto places and I have to say that this is by far the best. The steak was also very good. The service was great and they were very friendly.

Human,yelp-59,"We went here for a girls night out dinner. We ordered 4 different dishes and all of us commented that all of our dishes were very salty (sea bass, duck, swordfish). The service was mediocre- the waitress lacked emotions and her voice was so quiet we could barely hear her the whole time. As for the sides, the waitress asked what would you like for your side? to all of us, and we thought they were included in the meal. Later when we got the bill, we found out that the sides were about 10 each. No complaints, they probably will say it's your fault for not looking at the prices on the menu but we felt that she should've asked instead of sounding like she's offering sides. The restaurant does have a romantic vibe though- the interior was nice. However for a 250 bill without any drinks and 4 very salty dishes, I wouldn't come back."

The lamb was good but a little dry, and the fish was overcooked. The ambience was nice but the food was disappointing for the price. Always wanted to eat here and finally did. It was worth the wait. Food, drinks, and atmosphere were all great. We had a great experience at The Oyster Club. The food was outstanding. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We would definitely return. Such a beautiful restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice, upscale dinner. Everything was great. Food and service. Came to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. Service was great but food was a little salty. We shared 3 different appetizers and each one was good. Shared the sea bass and it was a little overcooked but still delicious. My husband had the duck and it was cooked perfectly. It was a little salty. I did not like the sides that came with the duck. Maybe the chef should rethink what they are serving. For dessert we had the chocolate cake with peanut butter and caramel ice cream. It was very good. Overall we had a great time and was so nice to have a waitress who was very attentive. The food was great but the service was a little disappointing. I had to wait for the hostess to come back to the front to be seated. After we sat down it took awhile for the server to come to the table and to take our drink order. Our waiter was attentive throughout the meal. We were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary and he brought out a glass of champagne for us but did not mention that it was complimentary until after we had drunk it. It was a nice gesture. Went there for a Saturday night dinner. We had a reservation but even at 8 PM there was a wait. The food and service were excellent. The place is a bit loud for dinner conversation but we made it through. We have been going to the Oyster Club for years. We always go for special occasions. This time was for our anniversary. The food was excellent as always. The sea bass was delicious. They have a new menu and I am hoping that the duck will still be on there. That is one of our favorites. The service was great also. I would highly recommend this restaurant. We went here for our anniversary dinner and were not disappointed. We loved the Oyster Club, so much so we went twice. We loved the food and the service. We ate in the bar area for a more casual experience, but you could also eat in the more elegant dining room. We loved the sea bass and the lobster. We are already planning to return. We arrived late for our reservation due to a flat tire. The staff was very understanding and accommodating. The food was good, but a bit pricey. Service was exceptional. Food was fresh, unique and delicious. We had a reservation for Saturday night and it took 40 minutes to be seated. The server was very nice but it seemed like she had too many tables to tend to. We had to ask for the check several times and each time she said she would be right back. We left without paying as it took too long. Went for lunch. The food was good. The service was good. The ambiance was nice. Very nice restaurant in a lovely town. The food was delicious, the service outstanding. A very pleasant experience. The menu and food were very good. The service was good but the noise was overwhelming. Went for a Sunday brunch. Food was good, as was the service. It's a busy place, so it's noisy. Very nice setting with a good atmosphere. Service was good and the food was very good. The restaurant is a bit pricey but the food was very good. The only negative was the fact that the waitress forgot to bring one of our appetizers. Food was wonderful. Service was good. Food was great, as was the service. Our only problem was that the restaurant was noisy and our conversation was difficult. Went for Sunday brunch.

When my work permit is issued I'll definitely plan again Great article! There are plenty of things you don't know about Disneyland Paris. One thing I'm curious about: what happens if people have tickets bought online and when at the park arrive with an original ticket? If it's not valid anymore? I think this would depend on which type of entry into the parks you're buying (online or through the gate). For example, Disney has several different types including Standard Access Passes which can only be used once per calendar year and Perpetual Passes which allow unlimited access every time the pass holder enters one of the four Walt Disney World theme parks. eep! I didnt even realize that I had to buy them in advance until I read your post. Thanks for sharing amazing tips!

Tsinghua,yelp-61,"Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list. We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were able to sit in the back. We were told we could order food, but we were unable to get our drinks until 7:30 pm. We had to wait for a table for our food. I was so disappointed. I ordered the Shrimp Cobb and the Tuna Nigiri. The Cobb was really good, but the tuna was not. It was just not worth the money we paid. We had to wait for so long, and the food was just mediocre. Surrender 2012-04-08T00:00:00Z Surrender is an upscale and romantic Japanese restaurant. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was very good. It is very expensive for the price. We were expecting a more intimate atmosphere. Surrender 2012-04-08T00:00:00Z We enjoyed a romantic meal here for our anniversary. It was a bit pricey but the experience was worth it. Surrender 2012-04-08T00:00:00Z The location is fantastic, you're in the heart of downtown but it is a 10 minute walk from the street. It's not in a strip mall or anything. Surrender is a very well kept restaurant with a great atmosphere. It is not a place for people who are picky about their food or who are looking for a lot of gimmicks. The food is pretty simple and to the point. The service was impeccable and the food was very good. It is worth the price and you will have a great time here. Surrender 2012-04-08T00:00:00Z The restaurant is right downtown, and it was a nice place to go for a romantic dinner. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We were able to get a reservation for the evening, which is something I didn't think we would be able to do since the restaurant was so popular. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice meal and a nice place to be. Surrender 2012-04-08T00:00:00Z Great experience. We were very impressed with the attention to detail and the atmosphere. Surrender 2012-04-08T00:00:00Z This was our second visit to Surrender and it was just as good as the first.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-61,"Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list. We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were one of only 12 people there tonight! What a great venue this is... I've seen live bands at places like The State Room and even Hootie the Blowfish in their own backyard but nothing compares with how amazing it was seeing them play inside an old church where you can stand right up against all four walls during some songs while being incredibly close yet not touching anyone as well (not that any girl wants me hugging her for too long). It also helped out having 4 members from our crew who are huge fans which made things super special because when Dave would sing ""Baba O'Riley"" he pointed his mic towards us 5 times haha.. No complaints about those three girls though . But seriously if ever my wife or girlfriend said she wanted something small sized then say no more: beer hat jumbo hotdog winning combo indeed!"
Human,yelp-61,"Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list. We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were able to get in without having to pay much. You would think on a Saturday night this club would be poppin but I guess not. There wasn't much people there and the DJ was just really bad that night. First time here and probably going to be the last. The dance floor was super small, and the DJ was bad. Drinks were the usual price of 10-15 dollars each. There is only one restroom on the outside as well. Nothing seemed to impress me here."
OpenAI,yelp-61,"Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list. We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were in luck! Surrender is a great nightclub located in the Wynn Las Vegas resort. The club features a large indoor dance floor, outdoor pool area, and top-notch sound and lighting systems. You can expect a mix of EDM and hip-hop music, with resident DJs such as Diplo, Marshmello, and A-Trak. It's recommended that you dress to impress, as the dress code is upscale fashion-forward attire. Sneakers, hats, and sports jerseys are not permitted. Also, make sure to bring valid identification as the club is strictly 21. If you're looking to avoid the long lines and have a more luxurious experience, you can reserve a table or a cabana in the outdoor pool area. This typically includes bottle service and a designated server for the night. I hope this information helps you enjoy your night at Surrender!"
LLAMA,yelp-61,"Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list. We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were fortunate. The line was pretty long, but the host was nice enough to let us in without waiting in the line. I would assume that he would do the same for everyone if they were closing the guest list, but I'm not sure. Overall, this club was pretty disappointing. It had a cool setup, but it just didn't have the energy that I expect from a club. It felt very much like a bar, and I didn't hear any dance music while I was there. This isn't the place to go to if you want to dance. The drinks were pretty expensive. The crowd was pretty good. There were a lot of good looking girls, and there were a lot of tourists. I would assume most of the locals would go elsewhere. I didn't like this place very much. It's probably because it just didn't have the vibe that I look for in a club, and it was pretty hard to meet girls."

Tsinghua,yelp-62,"I lived in Japan for about 2 years so anytime I feel reminiscent of those drunken 4am nights I come here. Not really so much like the ones in Japan, but like I've been to Japan. I live in Florida now and try to drink at least once a week, but it's never like that. I think we're both experiencing a bit of a love-hate relationship with alcohol. 2. I think we all do, but sometimes I think we're just afraid to admit it. I don't think I'm in love with it, but I definitely love drinking with my friends and being around people who love drinking too. 3. I think I just really enjoy the different kinds of food. I'm also obsessed with good beer. 4. Definitely. I know I have some pretty weird taste, but I do love a good 16oz. I know it's hard to impress people with that, but I like the way it makes me feel. I think I like it because it makes me feel like I'm in control of my own happiness, which I find I'm not when I'm eating too much. 5. I'm going to have to take that one on faith. I'm just going to go with the idea that we both have an inner child. Haha! And I'm pretty sure you don't drink that much, you just like to drink with people who like to drink. I've only had one beer in my life. I don't know what it was, but it was a good one. I was pretty happy to get it, because I didn't know how to get one. Now I just order a regular beer and it's still pretty good. I've never tried wine or liquor. I like beer and cider and spirits, but not to the point where I'd be like, ""This is the best thing I've ever had in my life."" I've never had a drink that was so amazing that I'd be like, ""This is the best thing I've ever had in my life."" I think that's just a little bit of an exaggeration. I have had some good beers, but I don't think they were that great. I guess I'm not sure how to describe it. I guess it's just not really something I'm a fan of. And I think that's pretty common, I think a lot of people aren't big fans of wine or liquor. I think that's pretty common, I think a lot of people aren't big fans of wine or liquor. Hmm. Maybe.

I have to agree with you on this one, I really don't enjoy wine. I have only ever had a couple of sips and that was enough for me.

And I didn't think Yoshinoya was one of the better gyu-don places in Japan anyways. They should add Japanese curry to their menu. I also wish they offered white meat chicken too. I also agree with the weirdness of the veggie color. I don't know why its gotta be so damn yellow. Just go to Ichiza instead.

Not really so much like the ones in Japan but they do have that Japanese-style food and snacks. Very loud and greasy.

It's an open bar from 9-11pm on Friday nights, and they have the best drinks. I had a lychee martini and it was AMAZING. The sushi is also great! I had a few rolls and a nigiri set. It was great!

They have great wine selections and you can sit outside on the patio in the nice weather. The only thing I will say is that the prices are a bit high for the area but that is why they are here. They are good. I have never been to Macayo, but it seems like a good place to go. They have an interesting menu and it looks like the food is good. We went to other places in the area and were very disappointed with the food. This place looks like it will be good. WOW! What a delicious meal. Everything was excellent and the service was outstanding. I had a fantastic time. Definitely will go back again! We were treated like royalty. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.

My husband has been known to pull out his fork on occasion - but he couldn't stop himself from swiping right after each bite of this delicious platter! (It is very hard to choose which dish to order as they are so good!) The portions were huge: I'd say there were about 12-16 dishes spread over 3 courses. Each one looked like something you'd find at your local Italian restaurant (or even better). They also used fresh ingredients that didn't require any crazy preparation before serving them up.

There were other films before that but it seems like they didn't have much interest outside Japan yet this film did so well...and quite honestly it won't take me long to watch the rest! Well okay maybe not soon because I'm going back again next week for another screening! I'll be keeping my eyes peeled however since it looks interesting I've heard nothing about any new works coming out... The only reason I haven't seen Princess Mononoke is because it's too expensive for me here. I wonder how successful Disney will make their own version? I mean why can't we just go home and buy a copy? What do you think of the movie? And if you're planning your trip around seeing Princess Mononoke where are you looking forward to visiting? Princess Mononoke sounds really cool! It looks great. Fantastic movie! Great review! I'll definitely recommend watching it We don't usually travel around Asia right now; more often than not our trips end up being shortish (usually 3 nights). This time though we've got three weeks planned - which means there may actually be some Asian destinations included. My first stop would most likely be Tokyo. I wanted to try something different so that might change once we arrive. It's also been ages since I've visited Japan, so could use a good dose of nostalgia:). For London - my favourite place in UK anyway - I know I'd probably want either Haneda Airport Terminal 2 or Heathrow Terminal 4. Gotta love all those shops and restaurants!! There's no way I'll miss Hong Kong. We're taking a ferry down to Macau later on today (!), so that makes us even closer! But still, considering I live almost exactly halfway across the world away, getting over to HK every couple of years isn't enough! Hong Kong, Bangkok and Venice stiln play a big part of my plans;). Monaco is also added to my list of places to visit someday. Thanks for including Hong Kong in our itinerary!! I took a hard look at Suzy Wong's book prior to deciding whether its worth traveling to Sin City. Would gladly read her opinion after reviewing the city myself instead of listening to someone else who might give biased opinions:P Yes, Tel Aviv doesn't come under boat cruise anymore - unfortunately Hertz does not allow renting boats through them so that's off the table for us. Guess that won't happen again until 2016 when they finally expand into Israel?!"

After receiving my food I had to wait 10 minutes for silverware while my friend that ordered from here waited 20-30 minutes. Morgan, you are getting started with some very good decisions! Your steps seem logical and intelligent! The only thing I would add is in regards to becoming more aware of what your body needs vs what you're hungry for: When I'm not hungry, I'd rather be conscious about taking time out every now then (ie eating breakfast) than having all those empty calories around me waiting to feed off me... My name is Fiona McDonnell, and I'm an accomplished author living in New Jersey as well as a freelance writer currently working throughout Southern California. My goal has always been to write books set in fictional worlds that inspire readers to travel beyond their comfort zones. In 2013, after years of writing short stories, I published my first novel, The Storyteller's Guild: A Middle-earth Novel. The book received five star reviews on both Amazon and BarnesNoble, leading to over 200 sales within two months of publication. In 2014, I released another fantasy adventure tale titled The Lost Book of Horus. This story also garnered five stars across multiple sites including Goodreads, Amazon, and Bookbub. Both these projects have taught me a lot about how people read fiction today; among other things, reading at home versus enjoying a coffee shop or Starbucks is much different for many individuals. Making sure each piece of content I've written can appeal to diverse groups of customers has proven itself to be one of my greatest challenges yet. Aside from being a stay-at-home mom who loves her family, I enjoy spending time outside hiking and biking with friends. When I amn't busy touring Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Alaska, I'll find myself visiting Disney World and Universal Studios Orlando during the summer months. Travel allows us to see new places so we never forget our roots. But sometimes life gets hectic - families get bigger, kids start going to school, bills pile up. And soon enough, they're gone. It's just too easy to lose sight of why we love traveling - because no matter where you're headed next, it's going to feel like... Think back to last year... Did you use your vacation days wisely? Like most people, if you've worked hard this whole nine weeks and got paid - you're willing to take advantage. If you're anything like me though - you might have missed a few opportunities by dreadfully planning ahead. Or maybe you were lucky enough to go somewhere completely unexpectedly. Either way,..."

After receiving my food I had to wait 10 minutes for silverware while my table mates were served immediately. I asked for a second set of silverware and they refused to provide them. It was just horrible and the worst service I have ever received. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will never eat there again. Rating: 110 Do Not Go I went to Hilltop a few times and have eaten there with friends. The food was mediocre, at best. It's ok if you like greasy fast food. The service was terrible, I waited 15 minutes for my food and I wasn't given a plate until I was eating. They refused to give me a second plate and would not give me a third. I would not go back there. Rating: 110 You'll Never Get Better Food I am a very picky eater and I have always found Hilltop to be very good. I am not a vegetarian but I do eat a lot of seafood. The one time I went there with my daughter and her friends and we were eating out, the food was absolutely awful. We went there for New Year's Eve and it was just disgusting. The server was horrible and she was rude to my daughter. She would not take our order and I had to ask her three times and she kept refusing. It was so bad that my daughter had to go back to the table and get her friends and we left. It was the worst experience ever. Rating: 110 Sloppy and Dirty I was disappointed with Hilltop. I had a friend who lives in the neighborhood and said she would take me there to eat. When I got there, it was very busy. The service was terrible and we waited 20 minutes for our food. I asked the server what the wait was like and she said it was normal for the time of day. When I finally got my food, it was cold. I ordered fish tacos and they were cold. I asked the server if the tacos were going to be cold and she said yes. I then told her to put them in the microwave and they came out just as cold. She refused to put them back in the microwave and said it was too cold. I was so mad. I had to order another plate of food. The food was just awful. I would never go there again. Rating: 110 Food was Disgusting I was very disappointed with the food. The service was terrible. I went there with my husband and he had the seafood chowder. He said it was cold and the seafood was barely cooked. He also said the food was not cooked all the way through. I also had a fish taco and it was just horrible. The fish was very tough and I didn't even eat it. I would never go back there. Rating: 110 Worst Service I have ever received This is a terrible place. The service was terrible. We were there on a Sunday and we were told that they were extremely busy and they would be 15 minutes late. We waited for 20 minutes and then we asked for another plate of food. The waitress was rude and said she would not provide another plate of food. We were so disappointed. I would never go back there. Rating: 110 You Will Not Get Better Food I had a great experience at Hilltop. The food was delicious and the service was great. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. I would go back there every time I needed to eat out. Rating: 110 Do Not Go to Hilltop I had a horrible experience at Hilltop. I went there with my husband and he ordered the seafood chowder. The chowder was cold and the seafood was barely cooked. I ordered the fish tacos and they were very cold. I asked the server to reheat them and he refused. He said it was too cold and he would not reheat them. The food was so bad that we left the restaurant. I would never go there again. Rating: 110 Poor Service I went to Hilltop with my wife and my wife was waiting for her food to come out. The server refused to give her another plate of food and said that she had to wait until the food was ready. The food was not ready and she had to wait for another 10 minutes. It was very rude and I was very disappointed. I would never go back there. Rating: 110 Do Not Go to Hilltop I was very disappointed with Hilltop. The service was terrible.

The manager refused to give me a refund and told me to leave. When I asked to speak to the owner, he told me he was not there. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

It's too early to comment on the food, but I'm giving them a high rating for the friendly and helpful woman who took my order. She was a joy!"
OpenAI,yelp-65,"I was there on a Sunday afternoon when it was dead and the service was horrible. After receiving my food I had to wait 10 minutes for silverware while my food got cold. Additionally, my drink was never refilled during the meal. I'm sorry to hear that you had a bad experience at the restaurant. If you have not already done so, I would recommend contacting the restaurant's management to share your feedback about the poor service and wait time for silverware. They may be willing to offer you an apology, a discount on a future visit, or some other form of compensation as a gesture of goodwill. It's important to give the restaurant an opportunity to address the issue and make it right for you."

This Chick is located off of South Blvd in the same shopping center as a movie theater, Target, and Ace Hardware. I have worked here for several years now. I love the customers that come to this place!! The people who work there are amazing! They always go above beyond just making sure everyone makes it home safe!! And they take care of anyone telling them about anything wrong with their order! Very happy. We have been going here since we moved into our new house over 20 yrs ago. My favorite thing about the service is when you pick up an ice cream cone at the checkout..when you tell them what flavor you want,they give you the size and make those choices and then charge you based on how big a cup or bag you select...you get the best deal possible without any extra charges."

Human,yelp-67,"I really liked this place! They have several options for pedicures-some organic products even used. But, the REAL reason I was so impressed by this place was the quality of their manicure! How many times have you gotten a manicure and like, literally, that week your nails chipped? (the answer is all the time) So, imagine my surprise when my manicure lasted almost 2 weeks! This is the regular run of the mill manicure that I received and it was awesome. Everything else was pretty standard for a salonthe people were really nice, it was clean, etc. My only tip: the new hot trend is to offer a free beverage;) Just a tip."
BigScience,yelp-67,"I really liked this place! They have several options for pedicures-some organic products even used. But, the REAL reason I was so impressed by this place was the quality of service that Rebecca and her team provided me with. I am not sure if you've been around long but there's a trend going on where people are trying to save money without compromising what they want in lifeworklife balance (for example). Sounds like something I'm definitely experiencing at work and how our jobs feel stressful and overwhelming sometimes.....and then being able to go home after a job knowing your feet were taken care of is priceless! Here is my ultimate pick of one year from 2017 - Jan Dec went over well and we still get together as much now as we did back when we started out because we loved each other enough... Now that's an awesome haircut!! I love it!! Great color too....always good to change up colors every once in a while!! This look is SO flattering on you!!! A lot of celebrities don't show off their legs or bodies these days-we all know why lol Oh yea, great photos! I've always thought about getting Brazilian Blowout since it's supposedly hard to dye darker than brunette (which I wish ) but I'd never had anyone do a blonde blow out before... This looks amazing! Those pictures make me crazy jealous haha! My mom gave me a PI:USER perm last weekend - totally changed the texture of my hair and she said I looked ""completely different"" And yes she told me my head would probably be calico-like for weeks because of it but it was worth it!!! Do any of those places offer extensions? I recently got my first extension done because my regular stylist left town. It only lasted 2 months (and he didn't tell me exactly how many strands!) but was very traumatic unfortunately: ("

Well, I took a photo of myself with my hands on a table and I noticed that my nails were not tidy at all. It was a bit of a mess. But, after the nail technician at the Spa, Katie, did my nails, I was surprised at how well she did. I was happy to see that my nails were clean and straight. The other great thing about this spa is that it's not just a manicure place, but they also do massages, facials, pedicures, and waxing. So, if you're looking for a relaxing spa, you can get it here!"
LLAMA,yelp-67,"I really liked this place! They have several options for pedicures-some organic products even used. But, the REAL reason I was so impressed by this place was the quality of the shellac job. They put a coat of clear gel on before the color, which I think prevents the polish from chipping. I never had my shellac last as long as this did (a little more than two weeks). Definitely will be returning. I've been to this salon for several pedicures, and they do a great job. The staff are friendly and professional, and the salon is nice and clean. I've also had my eyebrows waxed here, and the woman who did it was very good. Highly recommended! My toes look like they were run over by a truck, so I needed to find a place that would be able to fix them up and make them look good. I called this place and set up an appointment to get my nails done. I was pleasantly surprised when I got there. The salon was very clean and the ladies were friendly and did a fantastic job on my nails. I will be going back to this salon again in the future!"

They went above and beyond to make sure my feet were perfectly pampered. I started with a soak in a hot tub, which was incredibly relaxing. Then, the pedicurist gave me a thorough foot massage, which felt amazing. She used a variety of techniques to knead and release the tension in my feet. I felt like I was floating on a cloud after that. After the massage, the pedicurist trimmed and filed my nails, and then applied a coat of polish. She took her time and made sure the polish was applied evenly. I was so impressed with the quality of her work. When I was finished, my feet felt amazing. They were soft, smooth, and looked beautiful. I couldn't believe how much better they looked and felt. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great pedicure.

I was also greeted very quickly and cordially by the host. There was a decent amount of people there, but not so many that it felt crowded. The music was playing at a good level, not too loud that it was hard to talk, but not too quiet that you couldn't hear it. We started with a few appetizers, the pimento cheese dip was delicious and the fried green tomatoes were also very good. For our entrees, we had the chicken fried steak, which was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. The other person in our party had the salmon, which was also cooked perfectly and the asparagus was perfectly seasoned. For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake, which was amazing. It was warm and gooey on the inside and the chocolate sauce on top was the perfect complement. The service was excellent, our server was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed. We would definitely recommend 1947 to anyone looking for a great place to eat."
Human,yelp-68,"The atmosphere and ambiance of 1947 was quite good and there is no question that they have an outstanding selection of bourbon. I was also greeted very quickly and cordially from the bartender who took very good care of me. The reason why I am only giving this restaurant two stars is because I thought their food was not up to par. I was very disappointed because I heard from several people who good the food was. The discrepancy does not lie in the taste or quality of the food but in the quantity. I paid 12 for a burger that was smaller than my coaster. I'm sure it was quality beef and it was made well, but when I pay 12 for a burger I expect a 12 burger. I think they should at least disclose on their menu how much you can expecte the burger to weigh. Mine could not have been more than 5 or 6 oz. The fries that accompanied my burger were quite good, but worth 12. This came as a great surprise as the owners own Bites and Brews and Elbow Room, both of which I always have an excellent dining experience."

LLAMA,yelp-68,"The atmosphere and ambiance of 1947 was quite good and there is no question that they have an outstanding selection of bourbon. I was also greeted very quickly and cordially by a bartender who seemed to know his stuff. I started off with a Manhattan made with a Rittenhouse Rye. It was extremely well made, but I thought it was a bit overpriced at 11. After that I moved on to their barrel proof bourbon program. I've read a lot about this and have been very intrigued. I was pleased to find out that they had a variety of bourbons that have been barrel aged to suit anyone's palate, whether they like it young and hot or old and mellow. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed with the bourbons that I tried. I started off with an older bourbon aged for 7 years. The bourbon was very tasty, but a little too mellow and soft for my taste. I wanted something with more punch and more flavor, so I asked for a younger bourbon. What I got was a 4 year old bourbon that was too hot and harsh. I didn't finish it and was a bit upset that I had spent 11 for a bourbon I didn't like. The next bourbon I got was a 3 year old. It was more to my liking and I enjoyed it. I was hoping to try a 2 year old, but they didn't have any. Overall, I am not sure that the barrel aged bourbon program is something that I will do again, as the quality of the bourbon isn't something I would expect at a bar that specializes in bourbon. I also had a hard time finding a bartender to take my order at times. The bartender seemed more concerned with serving people that sat at the bar than me. I know they are in the service business, but I was a paying customer. If I didn't get up and walk to the bar when I wanted another drink, then I would have been standing there for a long time waiting for my order. In the end, I think it is a good place to go if you want a good selection of bourbon, but the barrel aged bourbon program is overrated and overpriced. The atmosphere is great! The bartenders are very knowledgeable about the bourbons they have and are able to help you select a drink based on your preferences. The drinks were all very good and the barrel aged bourbon program is a unique way to sample their bourbons. I would definitely recommend this bar to anyone who enjoys a good bourbon. I had the best time there, I had the house cocktail, and tried three different barrel aged bourbons. This place is not for the faint of heart, this is serious bourbon. The people were amazing, the selection was unbelievable, and the knowledge was incredible. I have been to Louisville twice, and had the best times at this place. Great place! Amazing cocktails! Super friendly staff! I love this place! I've been there twice now and both times it's been amazing! From the atmosphere, to the service, and especially the bourbon, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good drink and a great time. This place was ok. I enjoyed the bourbons and bourbon barrels but the cocktails weren't very good. Their Manhattan was very weak. The atmosphere was very nice and the service was excellent. The drinks were great as well. 1947 is a great place! We ordered a flight of 4 barrel aged bourbons. Each was delicious. We also had a few drinks from the cocktail menu. The Manhattan was exceptional. The bartenders were super friendly and knowledgeable. Their bourbon selection is great and the cocktails are amazing!"

Sigh, you know how hard it is for someone who knows nothing about nail art or manicures (well at least what they have in Europe) but still loves them? Well this wasn't just any salon that had good reviews on yelptown; we got there 10 minutes before closing time - after all of our running around trying out some local restaurants -and were told by one girl ""Well don't worry madam because if your nails are too long then cut em"" as another made us sit down right next her while cutting 4-5 women's hands without saying anything else... The whole experience totally felt like an overpriced version from home so thank god others did agree enough...it would be great especially since most places closed during evening hours which makes getting pampered even more difficult given their crazy schedules (So well done girls!!"

Human,yelp-70,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place! Sigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is 22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is 25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. They also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. What I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. There you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!! Well, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!"

LLAMA,yelp-70,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place! Sigh, I wish I had gotten the names of the nail technicians! They were wonderful. Irene said, ""I'm not sure how much to tip, what do you think?"" I said, ""I am going to give them 20."" Irene said, ""Are you sure?"" I said, ""Yeah, it was great!"" The nail technicians were great, but also it was their 15th anniversary and there were balloons everywhere and they had free wine. My mother called me while we were there and she said, ""Have some wine!"" I said, ""I'm at the nail salon and I'm having some wine!"" My mom thought that was pretty cool. So anyway, the pedicure was great, it was a warm water pedicure and they really did a great job. I got a beautiful, colorful design on my toe nails. So then I went back today to get my nails done and I'm pretty picky about that, but the nail technician I had today was amazing. First she did a hand massage, then she did a foot massage and then she did my nails and they were really pretty. I tipped her 10.00 and I can't wait to go back. I hope the same lady is there when I go back. I went back again with Irene and they did a great job. Irene said, ""I'm not sure how much to tip, what do you think?""

PaLM,yelp-70,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place! Sigh, maybe I am just a little bitter that I have been coming here for years and she just started and is already raving about it.  I have been going to this nail salon, Nails by Jessica, for about 7 years now and I can say that every time I have been here I have had a great experience. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and they take the time to make sure that you are happy with your nails. They have a wide variety of services to choose from, including manicures, pedicures, acrylics, and gel nails. They also offer a variety of nail polish colors to choose from, so you are sure to find the perfect shade for you. The prices at Nails by Jessica are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the service that you receive. A basic manicure costs $12 and a pedicure costs $18. They also offer a variety of specials, so you can often get a great deal on your nails. I would highly recommend Nails by Jessica to anyone looking for a great nail salon. The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the quality of the service is excellent."

Sigh, what can you say about these two beauties?! The owner is an absolute doll and even offered us champagne upon arrival so we could celebrate our anniversary!! It's all very professional but over the top adorable- it's like you're in a movie set or something. For everyone who's been there before (like myself), don't be afraid of how busy it gets because this place has NO time limit for clients!!! I'd go back again tomorrow just to spend more quality time with you girls! You're such a fantastic person. You deserve everything that's good - and if everyone did that then life would indeed be wonderful right? Thanks Kathy, I'm glad you enjoyed your experience too It really does seem as though they are celebrating their 25th anniversary.....very cool!"
Human,yelp-71,"These guys are pretty good (and cheap!) for a no-nonsense gym. No pool, no group classes, just a bunch of ellipticals, weights, and treadmills. For the low cost per month, it's a good deal. They provide cleaning solution and paper towels to wipe down the machines after you're done. I have previously been to gyms that make people provide their own towels to wipe down with, and I find this much more sanitary. Four out of five stars only because they're only open 7am to 7pm on the weekends."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-71,"These guys are pretty good (and cheap!) for a no-nonsense gym. No pool, no group classes, just a bunch of ellipticals, weights, and treadmills.

OpenAI,yelp-71,"These guys are pretty good (and cheap!) for a no-nonsense gym. No pool, no group classes, just a bunch of ellipticals, weights, and treadmills. For the low cost per month, that sounds like a great option for someone who wants to focus solely on their individual workout without the added extras. Low-cost gyms are a good investment for those who want to maintain their fitness routine without breaking the bank. However, it's always important to make sure the gym has all the equipment one needs and that the gym is a well-maintained facility to avoid any potential injuries."
LLAMA,yelp-71,"These guys are pretty good (and cheap!) for a no-nonsense gym. No pool, no group classes, just a bunch of ellipticals, weights, and treadmills. For the low cost per month, it's well worth it. I go in the morning, so the crowd is mostly older people (45). I've never felt uncomfortable or intimidated. I like how easy it is to find parking and get in and out of the gym. I've been a member of other gyms that take forever to check-in and out."

The only downside is that it can get a little crowded during peak hours, but overall I'm happy with this gym."

This place gets big kids running around like crazy with bounce houses, slides, towers, etc... It's basically kid friendly fun! The staff there are great especially when it comes to helping your child be safe while playing in public spaces or on the rideable toys. They also have adult supervision available so parents can hang out as well. Pretty cool stuff right? It's about 30 minutes outside of Napa valley that I found these amazing treehouses!! While they're not super fancy like those indoors ones I've seen, it's still adorably unique perfect if you're looking for outdoor adventures with your family!! I know some people might think this sounds boring but I really enjoy taking the time off during our busy workdays so we could spend more quality time together. And who knows? Perhaps after traveling to new places together along with doing things such as cooking dinner or going out to movie nights - maybe then I'll start loving myself even more than I already do Stay tuned next week where I'm gonna show y'all what else my list has been getting up too! Until then check back here tomorrow because I will let y'know how much money my net worth increased thanks to these items:). Enjoy reading!!!

Eleuther-AI,yelp-72,"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their actual order before being asked by our waitress if we wanted anything else (we had not even gotten halfway through with what they took away from us). Then when she brought out water it only came in one glass instead two like he said on his reservation sheet! This place is definitely better than MOA's steakhouse because at least here you get real silverware unlike most restaurants there that do bring your own platesglasses...but I would have rather gone somewhere more affordable such as Charlie Trotters or something similar just so my meal didn't feel wasted after having seen all these amazing foods online videos etc.. You can see why people love The Palm Class Catering; however be prepared while ordering food make sure everyone has detailed instructions prior hand otherwise no matter how nice someone sounds don't trust them 100 until everything comes back together again... Also since Beyonce does eat her meals off paper takeout boxes please also note: Use padded bags whenever possible!!!"
OpenAI,yelp-72,"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their promised time and still hadn't received our food. Our server didn't come by to check on us for long stretches of time, and when we finally asked about our food, she seemed flustered and unapologetic. We ended up having to rush through our meal to make it to our next engagement. Overall, our experience was quite disappointing, and we don't feel that the service matched the high prices at this restaurant."
LLAMA,yelp-72,"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their start time before we had our food. Nice ambiance, good service, and a great burger. Had the ahi tuna tartare which was delicious. Will go back next time we are in Chatham. This was my first time and I will be back! The menu had a lot of choices and the food was delicious. We were a table of three and everything was prepared perfectly. The service was excellent. We were in a large group and had a very good time. The waiter was very good and the food was very good. We would recommend this restaurant. Loved the server, the food, the atmosphere, everything was great, I would definitely return!! There were three couples dining together and we all had a great experience. The food was delicious and the ambiance and decor were perfect for the occasion. Our waiter was extremely helpful and courteous. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special evening. We had a great time! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Eating at the Impudent Oyster is always a pleasure. The restaurant is charming and the food is delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive. Bill was a great server, food was excellent and the atmosphere is very nice. The Impudent Oyster was outstanding. They are a true 5 Star dining experience. The food was wonderful. The service was impeccable. We will definitely go back to this restaurant. Everything was excellent and the service was outstanding. Our waitress was the best and made the evening a success. We ordered a lobster dish and it was not available. The waitress apologized and it was taken off of our bill. The food we had was excellent and we would return. Everything was perfect except for the length of time it took to get our dinner. We were eating early 6:00 PM and there were not that many people in the restaurant. Otherwise it was a wonderful dining experience. Great ambiance, great service, great food! Great food, great wine selection, excellent service, and a warm, cozy atmosphere. The best of all 3 local restaurants I visited this week. Beautifully prepared and presented food, attentive service, nice atmosphere and location. A bit pricy, but worth it. Very enjoyable dining experience. Friendly and attentive staff. Our server was wonderful and the food was delicious. It is a small intimate restaurant and we were able to talk and enjoy our evening. Service was outstanding, as was the food. This was our second visit and we are planning another for our last night. We had a group of 11 to celebrate a birthday. They accommodated us all and were extremely attentive. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding! Wonderful dinner. We ate in the lounge, which was a quiet, cozy spot for a dinner date. The food was excellent and the service was excellent. We had a terrific meal. The wait staff was very attentive and the food was outstanding. The best place to eat in Chatham. The food was delicious. We would go again. Our server was great. Food was very good. Salmon very good. We had an excellent evening at the Impudent Oyster. The service was prompt and attentive, the atmosphere was pleasant and the food was excellent. We had the tuna appetizer and lobster, chicken, and fish entrees. All were cooked perfectly and delicious. We were very impressed with the service. The waitress was very efficient and very nice. The food was amazing. The Impudent Oyster is a nice choice for a romantic dinner. The service is great, the food is excellent, and the ambiance is warm and inviting. Excellent food, excellent service. We've been here twice now and we will definitely go back. Very good food and service. Lovely ambience. The service and food were exceptional. We will definitely go back. Lovely restaurant and food was delicious. Service was great and everyone was very friendly. We would definitely go again. Our server was outstanding and the food was excellent!"

The menu is very extensive with many options such as soups, salads, meat dishes (including an all-you-can-eat fish buffet), pasta, small pizzas, risotto, seafoods, desserts etc. For those who are not sure what they would like there is also a carte available which includes a wide selection if you do not know your preferences We had no trouble finding parking on site at night in one street; however, note that on occasion it can be difficult to find space during the day - especially early morning or late afternoons when restaurants close earlier than others so plan accordingly"
Tsinghua,yelp-72,"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their time to be served. The food was good. A little salty for my taste. I would have preferred a more refined, light, fresh and elegant food. The decor was good, but the wait staff did not seem to be in sync with the theme. For a 14.95 12 chicken dinner, the portion size was small. My husband had the whole chicken, and that was a lot of food. The prices are good, but you need to be aware that it is not your average restaurant. We will be back, and I would recommend it. Our family enjoyed this restaurant and will return. Our party was 8 and all enjoyed our meal. We were seated quickly and received very friendly and efficient service. Our food was excellent and the wine was great. I ordered the half chicken with mushrooms, which was delicious and the kids loved the chicken tenders. I will definitely return to this restaurant. A great place to have a quick and inexpensive lunch. You can't beat the price and quality of the food. We were seated right away and the waitress was great. The chicken was great. The rice was a little too much like the smell of frying chicken. The mushrooms were excellent and the gravy was good. The whole roast was a bit dry."
PaLM,yelp-72,"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their food arriving. When it came, the steak was not cooked to the requested temperature and the fries were ice cold. The other party was also complaining about their food. When we went to pay, the hostess was very rude and did not seem to care about our experience. She said that they were busy and that was the reason the food was not cooked correctly. We will not be returning to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. We ordered a bottle of wine with dinner and the server never came back to check on us. We had to flag down another server to get the bill. The entire experience was very disappointing."
Human,yelp-72,"Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their entrees being dropped for ours. I had the meat trio and my wife had the mushroom risotto. The meats were well seasoned, but the churico was overcooked and hard like a rock. The risotto was a bit watery and needed salt badly. Had to request salt since they dont keep it on the table. The waitress must have been hired for her ability to wear a miniskirt, because she was very absent during our over 2hr long meal at this place. The best thing here that we had was the not-so-generous portion of calamari. It was flash fried to perfection and had the best breading I've had in a while. Giving two stars for the extremely slow service, and the underwhelming food. If I'm going to put down 100 per person for dinner, it should be above average in every way. This place fell way short of average."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-73,I had been to Lux a few times when they were located right next to Pena Bianco. Had to see the new place just a building over but a whole lot newer and now even bigger! It's an easy walk from there - theoretically anyway...[more] More

The bar is filled with some of the most stunning looking people in the city. Not a bad looking one in the bunch. It's filled with a hip 30 something crowd with a healthy dose of gay. It's kind of a cross between 30's and 40's. It's very dark. The lighting is a soft dark glow, low ceilings, and candles everywhere. They have a nice wine list, a strong martini menu, and some unique cocktails, a great place to people watch. The DJ is playing some funk, soul, and 80's tracks. They had a really cool corner with a huge stone sculpture, candles, and really funky chairs. The place is filled with art pieces and sculptures. The staff is really nice and friendly, and really attentive. The DJ takes your request, and has a great selection. The food is really well done, with a great selection of small plates. The special drinks are really strong and the bartenders know what they are doing. I enjoyed it, and will be back again soon."

Tsinghua,yelp-73,"I had been to Lux a few times when they were located right next to Pena Bianco. Had to see the new place just a building over but a whole different experience. The waiter was very nice and the food was really good. Had a few of the cocktails too.. That's why we went to the place - to drink and eat and they delivered. One word to say - great! I had a hard time choosing which restaurant to go to this time, I went to lux twice last year and it was very nice but I did not feel it was worth the wait for our table. So I was really excited to try a new place and try something different. When I walked in, I noticed that there was only 1 or 2 other tables in the restaurant and I was glad that I had chosen a time when there was not many people there. It was very quiet and very relaxing. The staff was very friendly and was not very patient with the 2 people sitting at the bar. They kept calling out ""you guys are the last ones here"" and then it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to get back to us. I was really impressed with the service when we went to lux last year. The food was very good and it was very filling. I had the calamari appetizer and it was very good. My friend had the lobster mac and cheese and it was very good as well. The dessert was really good. I will definitely go back. I am not a big fan of Indian food. I've only had 1 or 2 times and I really wasn't impressed with the food. I didn't think that I would be impressed with the food again but I was. The restaurant was very good. The waiter was very friendly and the food was really good. The menu was not that long and the prices were very reasonable. The food was very good and I will definitely go back. The best part of this place is the prices and the service. I had a waiter who took my order and made sure that everything was perfect. He did not rush us and he waited for us to finish our meal. The only bad thing is that there was a lot of people that came in the restaurant and the place was packed. It took a long time to get a table and we ended up having to wait for almost an hour to get a table. The food was very good and the drinks were very good as well."

We got the 30 Supreme pizza with everything on it for 36.00 and we had to put it in a box because there wasn't enough room at my house after all of us ate an insane amount, including me who is not much into spicy foods:). The crust tasted like bread but better than any other restaurant's that i've tried from Papa Johns or dominos (the resturant near our school) which are cheaply made flaky doughs barely able t...o hold up under toppings such as cheese sauce without falling apart completely!! This one held its own even though some people said they were overwhelmed by how hotspicy their pieces may have been..my friend jokingly called them ""balls"" haha so beware if you're sensitive:) Thumbs Up!!!"
BigScience,yelp-74,"My friends and I ordered this today and it was great! We got the 30 Supreme pizza with everything on it for 36.00 and we had to put it in a cooler bag due to how much there is. The gnocchi has been recently stopped by overweight people but in general it's one of my favourite dishes ever I am always happy when i see italian food reviews,i have never tried mozzarella sticks before..will try them as soon as possible.. Hi Mumsy Rob - that's so good about your friend's son!! They are so cute together and he seems like such an intelligent kid! Have you seen any recipes that call for turkey mince? It sounds kind of odd because mine is missing a few bones from being grilled then frozen...so I'm wondering if you've heard of anyone having success using ground turkey instead? It doesn't sound all too unusual either but I've not used it myself although some people do use quail or pheasant which works really well here too.

LLAMA,yelp-74,My friends and I ordered this today and it was great! We got the 30 Supreme pizza with everything on it for 36.00 and we had to put it in the fridge for the leftovers. We were all stuffed! We also ordered 2 orders of fries and 1 order of onion rings and they were also good. We also got a 2 liter Pepsi for 2.00. This was by far the best pizza we have ever had and we live right by New York City. I highly recommend this pizza.
Human,yelp-74,"My friends and I ordered this today and it was great! We got the 30 Supreme pizza with everything on it for 36.00 and we had to put it in the trunk when we brought it home. The slices are cut up in squares. We still have about a little less then half left, and there are 3 of us."
OpenAI,yelp-74,"My friends and I ordered this today and it was great! We got the 30 Supreme pizza with everything on it for 36.00 and we had to put it in I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the pizza! Did you have any difficulties putting it in? If you have any questions or concerns about your order, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-75,"Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we decided on lunch over dinner as an appetizer of course had some delicious samplers, soup starters etc It seemed like they were out off all their main entrees so when i ordered mine which also included sides (and yes these are not free) waited 45 min for them... The food came then went back again several more time before being taken away.... only once did anyone pay attention or even acknowledge our table with no apology at any point..... As you would expect there service has gone down hill from what used be excellent especially since this started happening after Hakim left.. Food still good though!"
Human,yelp-75,Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we all decided to go and we were extremely disappointed. The waiter came back maybe 10 times to fix our hookah and every time was worse. We always get the same flavor but this time it was way too strong and sometimes way too lite after just a few min. Of smoking it. It gave us all stomach aches too. Again the food was amazing but not so much the hookah.
BigScience,yelp-75,"Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we decided tonight would be our last visit because of the bad experience. The hookah smoke burns in your throat for hours, even after you stop smoking it it still lingers. We are both smokers so thought this would provide us with an alternative way to enjoy food. It did not deliver on that or any other promise. We had the chicken tikka which seemed okay but was missing flavor and overcooked. Then came the fish Tikka followed by rice pudding which neither tasted fresh nor appetizing. Other than those two items all others were good though pricey considering what we got."

LLAMA,yelp-75,"Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we came as a group. The hookah was very weak and had very little flavor. When the waiter was asked about it they said it was a weak flavor. I'm very disappointed. Great food, good service and music. Highly recommend this place to everyone. Amazing food, drinks, and service! I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this restaurant. The appetizers were unique and very tasty. The main dishes were even better. My wife is a very picky eater and she loved everything. The best part was the service. Our waiter was very attentive, explained the menu well and made sure we were happy with the meal. We will definitely be back. Love the food, service, and ambiance. The food was great, very flavorful. We had a combination platter, the only thing was that some of the meats were a little dry. The service was good, the waiter was helpful and attentive. The only thing that I did not like was the noise level. It is a very loud restaurant, so for a romantic evening, it would not be the right choice. Great experience. I have been several times now. Best middle eastern food in town and great service. Highly recommended. Everything was delicious. The service was great and the place was busy but not too busy. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was nice. I love this place! I have gone there several times with friends and family. I can always rely on the food being excellent. Love the food! I don't know how to make hummus at home so I just have to go there and order it. It's so good! Had a great time at Abu Nawas. I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The food was great, the atmosphere was very nice. This is a great place to take a date. The service was very good too. The only problem was that we could hear the table next to us and they were very loud. They were very busy so we probably could have asked to be moved to a different table. Otherwise it was a very good experience. Food was great but the service was very slow. I have been here several times and always have a great experience. The service is great and the food is delicious. This is a great restaurant. We went for our anniversary and had a great time. The food was excellent, very flavorful. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive. The atmosphere was very nice, romantic. The music was not too loud. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We will definitely go back. Everything was excellent, great food and service. I have been here several times and have always had a great time. The food is excellent and so is the service. I especially like the atmosphere. I will definitely be going back. I went here to try the new hookah lounge. It was very nice, the service was good. The hookah was not very good, the flavor was very weak. I went here for the first time and had a great time. The food was excellent, my wife is a vegetarian and there was plenty of food for her. Our waiter was great, he was very helpful and attentive. I highly recommend this restaurant. I love this place! The food is great and so is the service. This was my first time at this restaurant. It was recommended by a friend. The service was great, the waiter was very attentive. The food was very good, very flavorful. I can't wait to go back! I have been to this restaurant several times and have always had a great experience. I was there last night with some friends and it was the same great food and service. I highly recommend this restaurant. The food was delicious. The service was also great, our waiter was very attentive. The only problem was the noise level. It was very loud, it was hard to have a conversation with my wife. Other than that we had a great time. Very nice atmosphere, great food. The service was good too. This was the second time I've been here. The food is great, very flavorful. The service was good too. We did have to wait for our table a little longer than we wanted, but overall it was a very good experience. I took my family here for the first time. We had a great time. The food was great and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very helpful"
PaLM,yelp-75,Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we went there last night to try it out and we were all very disappointed. The hookah was burnt and the coals were old and black. The service was also very slow. The staff did not seem to care about the customers and they were not very attentive. We will not be returning here again.
Tsinghua,yelp-75,"Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we decided to try it again. I got the shawarma platter, I can't remember what my friend had. The food was still good, but the hookahs were a bit disappointing. The only hookah I liked was the ""Pistol."" The rest were either very bad or very average. The only good thing about the hookahs is that they are made of some kind of real wood, and the smoke is just as good as the smoke from the real hookahs."
LLAMA,yelp-76,"Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in school. The bartender was very rude to everyone and just generally did not care about the patrons. She must have gone to the ""Hey I am the bartender here and I can treat you like I want"" school of hospitality. So, I'll never go back."
PaLM,yelp-76,"Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in high school. I waited 15 minutes for service before finally catching the eye of a bartender who told me to wait another 5 minutes. After that, I walked up to the bar and waited for another 5 minutes until someone finally came to take my order. When my drink finally arrived, it was wrong and the bartender was completely unapologetic. I asked for a new drink and waited another 10 minutes before someone finally brought me the correct order. After I finished my drink, I left and never went back. I will never understand how a bar can stay in business with such poor service."
Tsinghua,yelp-76,"Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in South Beach. A guy was in front of me in line, had to ask for his drink order. I went up to the bar and ordered a rum coke, which took 15 min. to come. Tried to order a beer (3 packs) and was told ""They are not for sale here."" I was informed I had to go 2 blocks over to the neighboring watering hole to purchase a beer. Ordered a diet coke and that took 20 min. to come. When I was done with my drink, I made my way to the bar to pay. I was asked for my 20 bucks. I told the bartender I only had 10. She looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""Give me your 20 and we'll deal with it later."" I was so irritated that I just took my drink and left. WTF?! What kind of a place is this? I will NEVER be back! Thanks for ruining my evening, Deja Vu! Posted by Susan on 02142014 Great bar and staff, but for the past 3 months they have been losing their top DJ and the music has been horrible! The bartenders are also horrible and just like to pick on people. If you don't have a group of 6 people to order 6 beers or a case of beer, they will just not let you order. A good place for a group, but if you are single, don't even bother. Posted by john on 02072014 Don't bother with this bar. The staff is rude and inattentive, and the music is horrid. Don't come here unless you are with a large group of people, and then you can order six or more beers and not have to wait too long for them to be brought out. Otherwise, leave immediately! Posted by Mark on 02072014 Deja Vu has been the worst bar I've been to in Miami. Extremely rude bartenders, and the music is terrible. The service was horrible. The bartenders were rude and barely said hello. It took me 15 minutes to get my drink. And I got nothing in return for my wait time. And it wasn't just me. Everyone was getting annoyed with the wait time. And if you go there with a large group of people, you will be stuck waiting for your drinks because there is no one to serve you. And even if you go there with a large group of people, you will get treated like an idiot. And the music was so bad. It was the worst DJ I've ever heard. He was extremely bad. He didn't know what he was doing. And if you don't have a large group of people, they won't let you order your own drinks. It's a very very bad bar. Don't go there. Posted by Mary Ellen on 02072014 This bar is terrible. They don't take orders for drinks, they just ask for your money. I had to wait for a long time for my drinks and when I finally got my drinks I got nothing for my wait. The music was horrible and the bartenders were rude. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money. Posted by Jeanette on 02072014 It's a really bad bar. It's like a party scene. The music is terrible and the bartenders are very rude. I had to wait for 15 minutes for my drinks. I will never go back there. Posted by Susan on 02072014 I went to this bar to meet some friends for a drink. I was so disappointed in the music. I got there at 7:30 and there was a band playing. It was just awful. And I got so many complaints from other people who were there. And the bartenders were rude. I don't understand why the music is so bad. And the bartenders are rude. I would never go back there. Posted by Andy on 02072014 I was at this bar and it was a party scene. It was really bad. The bartenders were rude and the music was terrible. I don't understand why the music is so bad. And the bartenders are rude. I would never go back there. Posted by Jamie on 02072014 The music is terrible. And the bartenders are rude. I don't understand why the music is so bad."
Human,yelp-76,"Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in Southie (a well known anti-black area of Boston). I paid for my drink and the bartender placed my change in front of the guy sitting next to me. Ok, simple mistake, I thought. Watched the game and once my drink was done I saw her talk to her cadre of friends for over 20 minutes before I got another one...and it was the guy sitting next to me who bought me one and apologized for the now noticeble slight. When my drink arrived, I questioned the delay (4 people at the bar and maybe 9 in the whole place), the bartender asked me to leave. I walked and will NEVER return. Don't know why this place is rated so high. It sucks..."
OpenAI,yelp-76,Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in high school when the popular kids wouldn't acknowledge my presence. That's terrible to hear that you had a bad experience. Did you leave a review about your experience on Yelp? It's important to share your thoughts with others to prevent them from having a similar experience.
Eleuther-AI,yelp-76,"Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in college! The bartender seemed ""bored"" or had something better going on elsewhere, which made me even more upset as she could've easily engaged with us but didn't at all......it's like we were just people standing there waiting for her attention when they weren't busy doing anything else.....we asked if the beer selection changed often etc.....she said ""Just one of those nights..........""the food looked nice though (I know nothing about restaurants), It started off ok by serving up a few beers that are not your typical ones you see everyday; however after 11 pm..........not much left except what is ordered most frequently probably because no other customers come into such an empty place past 10pm!!! Bottom line: Don' bother unless u want some really shitty service regardless whether ur alonewith company...Expand"
BigScience,yelp-76,"Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in the military when all pilots were treated as VIPs. They did not acknowledge me once until they took our orders! And then after taking one look at what we ordered, failed to bring them out even though our waitress asked for them three times!!! Still had a choice of two or more different wines on offer but only 1 bottle each and none that matched our choices!!! We ended up walking away..... Not a good experience....... The room facilities are really nice with bathroom having jacuzzi tub which is great place you can spend time alone there - just by yourself if need be. A lovely hotel right next door to Westfield. It's ideal for those of us who like shopping, eating drinking. The rooms here are quite spacious compared to some other hotels nearby. Dinner options include 3 items (soups pasta), 4 items (vegetable main courses) and 5 item set meal (ricenoodlesdessert). If you're travelling solo, it's better to arrange a private booth rather than share tables because your company will disturb them during dinner service. Great location near Strand Road mall. Friendly staff very helpful although sometimes too busy to help. This restaurant has both an indoor and outdoor area...they serve both international food and Chinese dishes..the prices are reasonable, most of them less than RM30 per pax.. Dining at Swissotel Melaka doesn t disappoint. Staff friendly yet professional, delicious looking meals prepared freshly everyday, plenty of dining options available including buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner... Swissotel Hotel Melaka City Centre is situated along Melaka's famous Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman street where many tourist attractions such as Sultan Mosque, Stamp Museum, Batu Caves, Chinatown etc are located . Dining Room; There are 2 types of indoor seating areas namely Balcony Seating Area and Dinning Table Seating Area I love Sushi Shop sushi bars everywhere around Melaka. My favourite spot however remains the one inside the Grand Hyatt at Jalan Tuanku Abdullah road. Though their menu changes every now and then, they still keep to its original concept- authentic Japanese cuisine served within 20 mins order takeaway style using high-quality raw fish imported directly from Japan and made-to-order with high quality ingredients daily! For now I'm sharing my personal cheat sheet of places to try if you're stuck at home without much else to do. When COVID hit Malaysia early 2020, government came in to enforce social distancing measures henceforth known as Lockdown Phase 12: To ensure no local transmission, strict quarantine guidelines imposed stay-at-home restrictions on all Malaysians over 65 years old. On 22 April 2020 one month into lockdown phase two the Prime Minister announced resumption of air travel and public transport (except taxis and buses) Italian Restaurant: It consists of Italian Pizza, Pasta and Pastas Sauces, Ice Cream, Desserts. This is open till 11pm 7 days a week French cusine: Brunch Buffet is held Fridays-Saturdays 9am-11:30 am and Sundays 10am-12 noon. Diner Buffet is held Mondays-Thursdays 6pm-9pm and FridaySaturday 8pm-10pm"
PaLM,yelp-77,"Not all that. This joint has some of the best reviews short of Joel Robuchon but the fact is it's not much more than a glorified protein-buffet. The quality of the food is highly variable, and the service is often indifferent. The prices are also on the high side, so it's not the best value for money."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-77,"Not all that. This joint has some of the best reviews short of Joel Robuchon but the fact is it's not much more than a glorified protein-buffet. The quality of food and service varies wildly one night you'll be fine, another so bad I wonder what happened to my money (the same goes for most other restaurants in this area). What can make or break your entree at La Coqueta? It comes down largely on how good their fish selection are as they have several options ranging from broiled tilapia with lemon sauce (16) through fried whole red snapper topped off by mango salsa served over black rice platter 24), pricey if only because there isn't any meat dishes here even though its name translates into ""little cook."" If seafood doesn't appeal then go straight ahead without hesitation since no matter where else excellent value meals await those willing bargain hunters looking out!"
OpenAI,yelp-77,"Not all that. This joint has some of the best reviews short of Joel Robuchon but the fact is it's not much more than a glorified protein-buffet. The quality of the ingredients and the skill of the chef are certainly important factors in determining the quality of a restaurant, but they are not the only ones. Service, ambiance, and overall experience also play a significant role. It's important to consider all aspects of a restaurant before forming an opinion. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
LLAMA,yelp-77,Not all that. This joint has some of the best reviews short of Joel Robuchon but the fact is it's not much more than a glorified protein-buffet. The quality of the meat is very good and the meat itself is properly cooked and seasoned but the atmosphere and the service are dismal. The interior is a drab 1970's nightmare with bad lighting and a decor of cheap and nasty. The waiters were downright rude and there was not a smile to be had. I would not pay the price for this and would not recommend it to anyone.
Tsinghua,yelp-77,"Not all that. This joint has some of the best reviews short of Joel Robuchon but the fact is it's not much more than a glorified protein-buffet. The quality of the food is fine, but the atmosphere and service is a bit antiseptic. The combination of too many people, too many food options, and too many ""family"" style tables make it feel like a second-rate cafeteria. I've been here many times and I can't say I've ever really been impressed. It's not worth the long wait and the atmosphere is far from family friendly. The best thing about this place is the salad bar and the breadsticks. The service can be a little off at times. The salad bar is great. The focaccia breadsticks are amazing. The portions are too big and not filling. There is always a long line and it takes forever to get to your food. Terrible atmosphere, no atmosphere at all. They have a nice salad bar, but not much else. Food is good, but not amazing. Service is okay. Honestly, this is a great place for a quick bite to eat. It's a bit pricey, but I would suggest you try the tiramisu if you get the chance. You won't regret it. This place is one of the worst places to eat in the city.

The quality of meat is far from Prime; the salad bar is not bad; the wine list is fair; the service is acceptable. But overall, nothing outstanding. And for close to the same price you could get a great piece of meat at Envy or Joe's. This a good example of being careful not to take Yelp reviews as food-gospel...including this review."

BigScience,yelp-78,"Great food. Fantastic atmosphere. Best service in Vegas. Owner even drove our party of ten back to the convention center when the cabs were slow to arrive! Will return next time we are there. The staff was very attentive, friendly and always made sure we had everything we wanted from coffee, champagne or sparkling water to snacks before we left each night. The course selection varied daily so that one never got bored trying new things. We did a brunch dining experience during which they brought us four courses served on three plates with house salads including Caesar salad dressing but it wasn't required you bring your own as part of this package. We have recently returned from an amazing week at Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas. My wifes 80th birthday celebration and my 50th anniversary were both treated to first class concierge services by the Four Seasons team. Many thanks for all their hard work! Very good place to eat, not too pricey yet nice menu options. I would suggest going early if planning breakfast buffet - include some appetizers when checking out It's getting hotter outside...and it's starting to feel like summer here already!! As soon as i put on shorts, I'm ready to go swimming!!! Yummy!! I've been thinking about creating BBQ recipes lately (like Grilled Cheese Sandwiches) since you're supposedly allowed to grill outside now..... . Here is another dish I thought I'd share - Italian Summer Pesto Pizza. It's just what I've been craving! Think flavorful pesto sauce mixed into a flaky pizza crust fresh tomatoes mozzarella cheese delicious!! Definitely get creative with how much olive oil you use- maybe spread between two thin slices of bread? Enjoy"

LLAMA,yelp-79,"Cardinals football merits wings in this house. We ordered 70 wings for a house full of people for the game with an estimated wait time of 45 minutes. An hour and fifteen minutes later, we received our order... still piping hot, with our extra sauces and sides. The wings were really good and everyone was happy with their wings, but the wait time was too long for the party. If you're on your way to a party, the wait time may be worth it for the wings you'll enjoy when you arrive."

An hour and a half later, we called this Barro's location to see why we have not gotten our food yet. The customer service was horrible. All anyone said was Oh well it is busy because of football. When we finally received our wings, we noticed that we were also missing our salads that we had ordered. Once again we called and they could not refund us for paying for the missing salad, but only give us a credit for the next time we order from here, which will be never. I understand that a pizza joint would be busy, especially on a Sunday. However, the customer service that my family and I received was not up to par. I hold a higher standard to restaurants that when my order has been messed up, there are items missing, and if I have to call in twice, some sort of action be taken. My biggest regret is not going to Papa Murphy's for this Sunday football game!"

An hour and a half later, we still hadn't gotten our food. There was no manager on duty, no customer service reps and no one to call. I gave up. I ate my own wings and ordered myself a taco bowl instead. A disappointing end to a game that could have been very good if not for the Chicago Bears. The Bears are the last team to win in the stadium that they played in 20 years ago. They won't be the last. The Cardinals will be playing there next season."

We make sure we visit them every year, and every year we make sure we go to JFG. I've had the pizza and the pasta. Pizza is really good, but the pasta is to die for. Everyone that we've ever taken there says it is some of the best Italian food they've ever had. I love the atmosphere, and the service is always great! I've always enjoyed my experiences at Joe's Farm Grill. I've only been there once for dinner. On all other occasions I have eaten there for lunch. The food is fresh, the service is fast and friendly. They even have a great selection of beer. The only negative I can think of is that the prices are a little high for what you get. But they are not overly high. I think this place has a lot of potential. I really like the atmosphere and the concept. I would definitely recommend Joe's Farm Grill. This is the most disappointing place I've ever eaten in. I love pizza, and I was so excited to try this place. Not only was the pizza bland and over-priced, but the waiter was rude. The pizza crust was cardboard and the cheese was that stuff that comes out of a can. I am really picky about pizza, but I would never pay that much for that kind of pizza."

I unfortunately haven't spread out from my norm much because I love my burger with bleu cheese and mushrooms on it! Their different fries like the garlic fries and loaded baked potato fries are delish, and their onion rings are DELIGHTFUL. They make KILLER homemade lemonade (I get the Strawberry!) and know how to make a mean milkshake.

PaLM,yelp-81,"As a fervent Yelper, I read many reviews before booking a room at the Excalibur for my 21st birthday weekend. I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much gambling or drinking and would mostly be using the room for sleeping. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I ended up enjoying my stay. The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I particularly appreciated the free self-parking, as I had driven to Las Vegas from out of state. The location of the hotel was also great, as it was close to both the Strip and the Fremont Street Experience. One of the things I liked most about the Excalibur was the variety of dining options available. There was something for everyone, from fast food to fine dining. I especially enjoyed the Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho, which was a fun and lively atmosphere. The Excalibur also had a number of other amenities that I enjoyed, such as the pool, the spa, and the arcade. The pool was a great place to relax and cool off after a long day of sightseeing, and the spa was a great way to treat myself. The arcade was also a lot of fun, and I spent hours playing the different games. Overall, I had a great experience at the Excalibur. It was a clean, comfortable, and fun hotel with a lot to offer. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas. Here are some specific examples of things I liked about the Excalibur:  The staff was friendly and helpful.

I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much sleeping and keeping in mind a certain Yelper's admonition you get what you pay for I got even less than what I paid for. I booked a week in advance, for Saturday and Sunday night. I picked the cheapest standard room for Saturday and a Spa Suite for Sunday, Sunday being the much cheaper night of the two. When I came on Saturday, they sent me right to an upgraded room. This would have been cool if it was a Smoking King bed like I wanted instead of a Non smoking double. My 6 foot big ass boyfriend and I cannot fit in no double bed. I called room service to get this rectified and came in contact with the rudest, bitchiest motherfucking concierges I have ever encountered. These assholes need a lesson in customer service from my foot in their asses. They told me I was in no way guaranteed the room I ordered, and that I should be happy they upgraded me. I said I didn't give a shit, and I want the room I paid for. I asked them what guarantee I would have that the next night's spa suite and they said none I promptly cancelled the next night's reservation. We did have to stay that night in the Excalibur. So I might as well review the room. Which was shitty and had a shitty view and hat the shittiest bed linens ever. The hotel smelled like shit, looked like shit and had rude concierges. Also the bathrooms have no tubs, just standing showers. The patrons at Excalibur are even creepier and smellier and drunker than in the nicer casinos. I got a room at the Mirage for a barely any more and it was 10000000x better. Check my review for the Mirage, and DONT STAY AT THE EXCALIBUR."

BigScience,yelp-81,"As a fervent Yelper, I read many reviews before booking a room at the Excalibur for my 21st birthday weekend. I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much shopping in Manhattan due to the high cost of living. I was pleased with the hotel's value and location - on Fifth Avenue, only steps away from Times Square. But it didn't have an elevator, which is something I'd like more hotels these days to provide (assuming they don't mind paying extra). Also, some rooms did lack views so you couldn't see Broadway or Central Park: much better than no room view at all. A few months later, though, when we took our first trip abroad as newlyweds, I noticed that my apartment overlooked Central Park West and had amazing views every morning. (It was also near Bryant Park.) We ended up staying there again two more times. The one drawback? No elevators! This time around, after getting the full low-cost hotel experience, I decided to upgrade because I've come to expect more service out of luxury accommodations now I'm married too - especially if it's senior prom night! With its new design, the upgraded Le Meridien GrandStatler has been totally renovated, including a new lobby where guests can relax by the fireplace in front of blackened marble floors and richly decorated walls. There are six elegant suites available to book here; each includes floor-to-ceiling windows facing Manhattan skyline. The price starts slightly higher than the average A-list NYC hotel but that's what makes this place unique."
LLAMA,yelp-81,"As a fervent Yelper, I read many reviews before booking a room at the Excalibur for my 21st birthday weekend. I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much gambling (what happens in Vegas...) and that I would be spending most of my time exploring the many attractions of the strip. The Excalibur was the cheapest hotel on the strip, so I took a chance and booked a room. The only problem with the Excalibur was the fact that my friends and I had to walk through a casino to get to the elevators. We had to maneuver past lots of gamblers, and it was a bit of a trek, especially when it was raining and we had to take our shoes off and put our feet in plastic bags to get through the downpour. But overall, the location was great, and the hotel was clean and comfortable. I would stay there again if I were going to Vegas with the same purpose. The next time I went to Vegas, I knew that I would be spending more time gambling, so I chose to stay at Treasure Island. I liked the tropical theme of the hotel, the pirate ship, and the swimming pool area. The casino was a bit crowded, but it was manageable. I would stay here again, especially if I were traveling with a significant other. This was my most recent trip to Vegas, and I chose to stay at the Wynn because it is a more upscale hotel. I knew that I would be gambling more, and I wanted to enjoy the luxurious rooms. It was a great decision. The rooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable. I loved the shower, the bed, and the living area. The only problem was that we had to walk through the casino to get to the elevators, and it was a bit of a trek to get to the pool. But overall, it was a wonderful experience. Overall, I would recommend these hotels to friends and family. If I were to choose one to stay at again, it would definitely be the Wynn."

There were also ample charging stations for my electronics and a mini-fridge to store snacks and drinks. The Excalibur boasts several restaurants and shops within the hotel, so I didn't have to venture too far for meals or souvenirs. The hotel also has a pool area and a gym, though I did not make use of these facilities.

Tsinghua,yelp-82,"Wow... I smell a bankruptcy happening here soon. This place is amazingly outdated. I mean REALLY old school. Dirty, dingy, and just plain silly. The attractions at the top are in a very bad state, the rides are worn and run down, and the bathrooms are a joke. The restrooms are an open area in the middle of the midway with no privacy whatsoever. In fact, I was shocked at the lack of security on the area. The next time I go there, I will be bringing a video camera and recording the whole thing. The lady that was in charge was not very helpful at all. It seemed like she was more interested in just trying to make sure we didn't get out of the gate and onto the midway before the gate was closed. I can't believe this place is still open. Maybe it's the entertainment district, but it seems like they should at least make an effort to upgrade it. If you're going to be open, you need to make sure that the attractions are in good working order. I have to admit, I'm not really a fan of clowns, but this guy was insufferable. It was like a regular person dressed up like a clown. Maybe it was just me, but he seemed like a real jerk. I'm sure there are many clowns that are nice and entertaining. However, this one was really insufferable. There were a few other clowns that were pretty funny, but this one was just a joke. I really don't like clowns. They make me nervous and they seem like a bit of a nightmare. I'm not sure why they're in carnivals. I'm sure there are plenty of other things they could be doing, but that's just my opinion. I can't wait to see what happens to this place in the next few years. It will either go out of business or get some upgrades. Maybe they could use this time to bring in some new attractions. I'm sure there are plenty of places they could go and see about a new attraction. I'm sure there are a few places they could look. This place was really boring.

BigScience,yelp-82,"Wow... I smell a bankruptcy happening here soon. This place is amazingly outdated. I mean REALLY old school. Dirty, dingy, and just plain silly. The attractions at the top are amazing but if you're only going for a quick run through then skip them. Don't even bother to take your kids there because their play area (ie slides) will be packed with people trying to beat you up. The prices of merchandise at these stores aren't bad however they all seem very repetitive in nature so it can get a little tedious after a while. You also want to note that this isn't a place where anyone who isn't on the autism spectrum should go as most of the employees don't speak English or Spanish which quickly becomes frustrating when trying to communicate about something important like what we need to buy before closing time or how much we're carrying around. I'm not sure why the park itself got such negative reviews online nor do I understand what's wrong with wanting to have fun regardless of age group. I think it's safe enough to say that everyone deserves a chance to laugh once in awhile and nobody else has to suffer having no one around smiling back to look up at himher. If that's true then why would some consider an adult playground to be childish? It's basically creating space for those who may have been forgotten by society long ago - children! And yes, I know it's expensive and probably doesn't appeal directly to every passer-by walking down Main Street USA but please try my advice before comparing yourself against other parks and deciding you made a mistake taking your family out somewhere new. We had a great experience and hope our review helps someone decide whether they'll visit next year! Having visited both Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios recently I found myself inclined towards saying 'Disneyland' rather than 'Hollywood Studios'. As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing magical about any reenactment theatre; they're merely glorified scenery shops disguised under the guise of entertainment. There was plenty to see and do at each of the two areas I visited - but more importantly to me, I'd hoped for excitement from each site. In reality though, I've seen utter blandness galore over recent visits, largely due to their inability to connect with guests emotionally beyond the basic scripted scenes which include characters singing songs... There were many reasons I decided to visit Europe during August 2019 - happily weather wasn't the biggest challenge faced by us. With rain storm warnings already announced several months earlier across England Wales, Scotland Ireland, Germany Austria I chose to remain dry throughout the trip instead of putting off plans until late April 2020. The largest proportion of UK tourist arrivals come via Lilliputian gates in London Heathrow Airport direct from Asia, Australia New Zealand so staying away from continental Europe filled another unfulfilled desire..."

This coaster is nothing more than a carnival ride. The seats are horrible and the ride itself is just horrible. It is a very poor excuse of a coaster. This coaster also has a very odd lap bar that is hard to adjust to, so people have to ride with the lap bar down. This is also not a very smooth ride at all. The only positive I can give is that it does give good air time. The rest of the park is also out of date and not very good. The go-karts are a good thrill but the rest of the park is outdated and not very well kept up. Overall, this is one of the worst parks I have ever been to. -2 Rating bumprnugit on 6162008 1:41:00 AM WARNING: Do not read this review if you are easily offended or are looking for a glowing report on a park. Today I visited the place known as ""Story Land"" for the first time in a decade. Nothing much has changed, but my perspective has. I came here as a kid with my parents, and it was one of the highlights of my life. As I grew up, I realized that this place is crap. It's nowhere near as bad as ""Lake Compounce,"" but it is still a shithole. There are two saving graces. One is ""Dante's Inferno"" which is an interesting wooden coaster, but it's short and it's very hard on the back. It's still cool though. The second saving grace is the ""Granny's Taxi"" kiddie coaster. It's fun to ride, and it's a nice little classic coaster. Everything else sucks. The ""Flying Dragons"" is a cool ride, but it's not that exciting. The rest of the park is carnival rides with rusty metal parts. And what the hell is up with the ""Raging Rapids?"" It was a big waste of money and it's not that fun. The troughs look rusty and you can't see anything. This ride should be called ""Dante's Inferno: The Ride"" because it's a good representation of the ride, and how the whole park feels. The park is full of trash. Garbage is everywhere, and the whole place feels very dirty. I'm also shocked at how much the park charges for admission. The park is not worth it, and there are better places to go. I don't plan to return to this place again. 0 Rating fw190pilot on 10192007 12:58:00 PM Wow, this place has changed! As a kid I enjoyed this place, but I hadn't been there in 10 years. I got in for free on a school field trip, so I didn't feel so bad about being disappointed. My main problems were with the staff, who were very rude and unfriendly, and the waterpark, which was dirty and smelled like rotting chlorine and algae. I did like the kidd"
Eleuther-AI,yelp-82,"Wow... I smell a bankruptcy happening here soon. This place is amazingly outdated. I mean REALLY old school. Dirty, dingy, and just plain silly. The attractions at the top are great for young families but nothing good to do with your kids after 10pm or so when they're getting tired of sightseeing already (or you have older ones who need some entertainment). We were all worn out by 7-8! I'd say our time was about 4 hours total walking around in this area which isn't too bad considering we had no interest anywhere else except restaurantsbars closeby - again because everyone there on vacation wanted dinner before 11:00 p..m....ugh!! There's literally only 3 places that ring any sorta excitement if not amazing food nearby as far north up towards Disney World goes near Universal Studios Orlando theme park.....but it gets ugly quick once heading south......the same holds true going both directions from downtown Daytonah beach where everything interesting ends within 1 mile radiuses........lol"
Human,yelp-83,"Having had prior experiences at The Nail Room that were entirely positive, I was extremely disappointed when a recent negative experience was met with no attempt to make things better. My daughter and I visited for manipedis, and the nail technician who worked with my daughter was over zealous in working on her big toe. My daughter told her it hurt, but she kept going. The next day the toe was sore, red and inflamed. I contacted The Nail Room and was asked for the technicians name. That was the last I ever heard from them. They made no attempt to follow up, check on my daughter's pain or provide any compensation. As we had had such positive experiences in the past, I expected more. The owner was short with me and made no attempt to fix things. Back to the search for a good nail place, as we will not return to a place with so little concern for their clients."

This is despite the fact that my initial booking and payment for an appointment being made on Tuesday evening, in order for me not have to wait until Saturday morning. The results of this can be seen by viewing the photo below which shows my original nail art job (borrowed from another website) before it all started going wrong - Overall I'd give them 6 out of 10 points overall but I'm currently unable to return due to COVID 19 so don't know how long it's been since I've left there!

OpenAI,yelp-83,"Having had prior experiences at The Nail Room that were entirely positive, I was extremely disappointed when a recent negative experience was met with no attempt to make things better. I'm sorry to hear that. It can be frustrating when businesses fail to provide the level of service we expect or compensate for any negative experiences we may have. Have you spoken to management or customer service about your concerns? It may be worthwhile to express your disappointment and see if they are willing to make things right. Alternatively, you could consider leaving a review of your experience to inform others and possibly prompt the business to improve their practices."
PaLM,yelp-83,"Having had prior experiences at The Nail Room that were entirely positive, I was extremely disappointed when a recent negative experience was met with no attempt to make things better. I went in for a pedicure and a manicure, and the technician who did my pedicure was very rough. She dug her nails into my feet and cut my cuticles too short, which was very painful. I told her that she was hurting me, but she just kept going. When I was finished, my feet were bleeding and my cuticles were so sore that I couldn't wear shoes for a few days. I went back to the salon to complain, and the manager was very dismissive. She said that the technician was new and that she would ""talk to her."" But she didn't offer to refund my money or do anything to make things right. I was very disappointed with the way that The Nail Room handled my complaint, and I will not be going back. I have been a loyal customer of The Nail Room for years, and I have always been happy with the service that I have received. But this recent experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I am not sure if I will ever go back. I think that The Nail Room needs to do a better job of training their technicians and making sure that they are providing quality service. They also need to be more responsive to customer complaints and make an effort to make things right. If they don't, they are going to lose customers like me."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-83,"Having had prior experiences at The Nail Room that were entirely positive, I was extremely disappointed when a recent negative experience was met with no attempt to make things better. I went in for my first manicure here and left feeling like the service could have been done far more professionally...and it all starts from what happened before they even brought their ""tools"" out! Not only did we wait over 10 minutes (in an already packed shop) but there is NO ONE IN CHARGE!!! You walk up as soon you are seated by one of two employees who just sort-of guide people through these steps without any direction or supervision whatsoever until someone eventually comes around asking if anyone needs help finding anything? If this place doesn't know how busyslow times get between appointments then maybe training should be considered because having so little interaction seemed lazy on everyone's part since not many services seem included during those time slots either....sadly our appointment lasted about 25 mins total including waiting another 5 min after getting home afterward due completely unprofessionalism throughout both phases!! Had never heard such bad reviews nor experienced them myself yet; therefore felt compelled tp share..hopefully something happens within reason otherwise will strongly reconsider going back again anytime....."

Like the avocado toast at Crosby Bakery and Cafe where they make their own toasts with fresh ingredients. The other thing I've noticed that has made my life easier lately are items from TJ Maxx Marshalls for sale in high-end stores like Nordstrom Rack or Saks Fifth Avenue as well as online on sites such as Overstock (where you can buy designer shoes, handbags etc.) which makes sense since many of these brands will be returning products later this year. This means now you don't have to wait until next summer when your favorite store starts selling them back in stock. Here is what I've been wearing while shopping around town! As a side note, I'm not sure why but most everyone was sporting winter coats today! You look lovely!! Love those boots - great choice! And yes, Fayzay looks really good:) xo Diana Thank you very much Kelly! You know how crazy it gets here during December and January because we almost always get snow...but sometimes there isn't any;) Your jacket is fabulous!!! Thank you for sharing about all the new trends too..it's nice knowing before buying anything else lol.. I am glad you're enjoying putting together your closet ahead of time. I'll do one of these posts every few months with some ideas I'd like people to readconsider. My goal would be to teach women better ways to shop and save money without having to sacrifice style or fashions. Love the trend alert, you'll learn something everyday! Thanks for joining us over at Enjoy Life With Style!! What an amazing collection of clothes you've got going into spring! Great job organizing everything by brand! We need tips more than ever nowadays:) Thanks Deborah...it hasn't gotten cold yet although I hear Central Florida may start getting dusting after the weekend... She gonna love her Christmas gift its just a box but she loves her Christmas present even though she's already had three presents!!! Beautiful selection! Funny enough, due to our lack of snow last season, we've gone through wayyyy less clothing than usual in only two weeksnot including gifts received. Luckily we were able to splurge on lots of jewelry and shoes because most things came out of storage anyway. Aww thanks Michelle....I thought I missed the post but didn't see it come up. Maybe someone saw it? Didn't think anyone looked twice at mine LOL.. Ohhhh I want some of that jumpsuits right now! Sounds like you enjoyed yourself! Time passes quickly huh? I'm obsessed with that coat (or pants)! It's actually CRAZY how fast Fall went by this week especially outside. I wish it was warmer already haha"

I don't like to make assumptions about people based on their food choices. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. It's all about taste and preference. In this case, I like it and I can tell you that you will too. It's a bit on the expensive side but if you enjoy it, it's worth it. I'm glad I finally had it. August Henry's is on Water St. in downtown Fredericksburg. The place is quite full and has a nice mix of people. I really like the outdoor patio, but you'll have to wait for it to open. I will definitely be back to try the fish sandwich again. The grilled cheese sandwich is a good value too. 01072012 I'm back from a wonderful two week trip to Florida. It was nice to see family and friends and of course, have fun in the sun. I also had some delicious food while there. This is a short post to highlight some of the food I had. Let's start with the most memorable meal I had. I went to the renowned Barbecue Hall of Fame in Melbourne. I got to eat the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. It was on a hot dog bun and it was cooked in an oak wood fire. I had to go back for seconds. It was so good. I also had to try the fish tacos. They were great. Next up was a stop at a restaurant called Poke (the Hawaiian version of sushi). They have a big selection of poke and the fish was very fresh. I was able to try many different types of poke and it was all good. I also had the opportunity to try some of the local dishes. I had a gator burger at a local place and I had some gator fries. They were delicious. I also had a local type of fried fish that was grilled on the side of the road. I don't remember the name of it but it was very tasty. It's a shame I didn't have a picture of it. I'll try to remember the name of it and try to find a picture for you. I also had a great meal at one of the local Italian restaurants. I had the most amazing shrimp scampi with the sweetest calamari. It was so good I wanted to eat the entire meal in one sitting. I think I will go back and try some of the other dishes. I had to try some local wines. I was able to taste several wines and they were all very good. I will have to try more. I will definitely be back to Florida. If you are ever in the area, I recommend checking out some of the local restaurants. You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to go back. 01052012 I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to travel to Florida for a few days with a couple of my friends. I was excited to see family and friends and to try some new food. I also had a great time playing golf. I had some great food while I was there. I had some delicious fried fish tacos and a gator burger. The fish tacos were served on a hot dog bun. The gator burger was grilled and served with chips. I will try to remember the name of the restaurant I had it at and I will try to find a picture for you. I also had a delicious shrimp scampi. I can't wait to go back and try some more.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-84,"August Henry's is a regular lunch stop for me downtown. Yes, it's still lent so I once again tried a fish sandwich. I promise I enjoy all types if food. But the flavor and texture of this was like having an ice cube placed in my mouth with only salt on top because that may be how you feel after eating one too many hot dogs at baseball games or sitting between two other women who are taking turns using your lip gloss as their own personal applicator... I don't know what to say about these besides they were good but not spectacular especially considering there wasn't any spice involved which would have taken them from okay into delicious territory! The bread tasted fresh however maybe next time just get sliced loaf instead? It seemed more suitable than round loaves since we weren' t trying something new here although now everyone knows our go-to dinner choice when dining out consists mostly (or exclusively) of pasta dishes: shrimp spaghetti!! Perfect combination!!!:D"

I wanted to share that it can be tough squeezing in lunch here under the traditional 1 hour lunch window. Also anticipate the bill to be closer to 15 per person and easily could be 20 if you do some add on's. I went with jumbo fish sandwich and a cup of soup. The soup was a cup of clam chowder and it was delish! I could have just eaten a few bowl of that. The fish was breaded and perfectly cooked with a side of chips. I got my ever present coke w cherries added. I recommend this stop if you are lucky enough to work downtown."

I just find myself ordering fish sandwiches more and more during lent. This one is quite good. It's a blackened mahi-mahi on a toasted ciabatta roll. It comes with lettuce and tomato and I added cajun mayo. It was excellent. I love the location of August Henry's. It's in the Hilton Hotel downtown near the corner of Market and Commerce. You can walk to it from the arena, the convention center or the ballpark. The restaurant is open from 6:30 am to 10pm daily. The menu has everything from sandwiches to steaks and salads. It's a great place to stop in when your downtown for lunch or dinner. You can also enjoy drinks and appetizers in the bar area which looks right out onto Market Street. August Henry's is located at 1001 Commerce Street."

PaLM,yelp-86,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the service. I've been here twice, both times with groups of friends. Both times the service was terrible. We ordered drinks and appetizers and they were never brought out. We had to wait 30 minutes to get our food. Even then, our food was cold and the wrong order was brought out. We sent the food back and waited another 30 minutes for it to come out. The manager was not helpful at all. We asked for a refund and he refused. He said that we had to eat the food because we had already opened it. We told him that the food was cold and wrong, but he still refused to give us a refund. We will not be coming back to this restaurant again. The food at the restaurant was not bad. The burgers were cooked well and the fries were crispy. The service, however, was terrible. We had to wait a long time for our food and it was not even cooked correctly. We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-86,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the service at this location - especially in comparison to our last visit there (which was earlier today) where we were treated rudely by an employee who clearly didn't like us or what he thought might be ""our kind"" of people ie., young professional couples without kids with decent disposable income; i know that's not very PC...but it sure feels harsher than being called lazy because you're on your lunch hour rather then sitting inside working all day! Either way I don't think my husband will ever return after yet another bad experience... This particular restaurant always has high ratings so maybe they have changed their policies about how employees should treat customers? Too much money involved perhaps??? Or just plain laziness which seems hard wired.........??"
BigScience,yelp-86,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the waiter at one point evidently thought I was talking to him after he had finished speaking because when we were about to leave (after ordering our second meal) he asked if there was anything else on his list of orders that they could put out. The menu does not have an option for gluten free so I ordered their Wraps Fries which included some kind of bread with cheese in it along with fries. When it arrived my friend and I both noticed that the bread did not taste like regular wheat bread and neither of us liked the texture or flavor. This wasn't something that bothered me much before as I don't usually care what the ingredients are behind a dish however this time around being able to substitute another type of bread would be nice Ultimately this isn't really worth taking 2 star rating away from them since overall it's still pretty tasty. This was actually quite enjoyable! We got the Caprese sandwich which came uncooked and ready to eat - perfect weather. Then added some sauce for dipping all over the top- brrr! Delicious! The meatballs were very buttery and thickstewy, though by no means dry. They weren't too salty either, so they're definitely easier portions than those classic Italian balls you get in the supermarket. Also delicious: creamy alfredo sauce drizzled throughout. Being gluten-free friendly also meant I didn't worry about cross-contamination issues; I've never felt more confident eating out again:) Really lovely takeaway restaurant, great atmosphere and service. Food comes quickly and freshly cooked. Didn't try bruschetta yet but will be sure to do soon. Highly recommend For lunch next week I'm meeting up with 3 other friends who made reservations through Groupon and want to go out to dinner. We've tried many restaurants together and each group member has different dietary restrictions. (i.e., vegan, vegetarian, dairy etc). So when we first met online many years ago, we'd set aside dates where everyone would only order things that worked for them. But now we're planning our lives differently....so we've agreed on our date night plans separately then come up with fun meals to makeorder without knowing ahead of time what's available based off reviews, menus andor recommendations."
OpenAI,yelp-86,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the lack of customer service. During my last visit, the waitress was incredibly rude and unprofessional. She made us wait over 20 minutes for our food without offering any explanation or apology. When we asked about our order, she responded with an attitude and seemed annoyed by our questions. It really put a damper on the whole experience and we left feeling frustrated and disrespected. If they could improve their customer service, it would make a big difference in the overall dining experience."
LLAMA,yelp-86,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the wait time. I'm getting sick of waiting for my food at this place. I have been here on a Saturday night and it took 40 minutes to get a burger. Today I am here for lunch and it's 1:45 and I have been waiting for my food for about 20 minutes. I shouldn't have to wait this long to get food when there are two people sitting at the bar. We have eaten here a few times and have found the food to be good. We generally get sandwiches, nothing over the top fancy, and they have always been good. The service is good and the place is very clean. We had two meals here recently. The first was a great pizza and a very good salad. We came back the next day and ordered a burger and a wrap. The burger was good and the wrap was meh. I thought the wrap was pretty bland and I did not like the sweet potato fries that were served with it. I'd skip the wrap and order the burger. This is a very good place to go for a pint and a great sandwich. I have been here several times and have always gotten great food. The food is not fancy, but it is always very good. My only complaint is the size of the place. It is too small and too loud. I had a hankering for Mexican food and this place did not disappoint. The food was very good and the prices reasonable. The service was pretty good too. I will be back. I had a craving for some authentic Mexican food and decided to give this place a try. I ordered a chimichanga and it was not bad. I have to admit that I am not a big fan of the rice and beans that is served with everything, but the food was very good. The service was decent too."

I have never seen a place with a worse service staff. I have never had a waiterwaitress give me a dirty look or act rudely to me. The staff here always act like they are on their last day at work. They act like you are interrupting them or making them late. The most recent time I was there, I ordered a burger and fries. They brought the fries. When I asked for the burger, the waiterwaitress acted like I was some kind of idiot. I had to repeat myself twice before she understood me. She also acted like I was bothering her and acted like I was making her late for work. I was in a hurry so I went ahead and ate my fries and left. When I got home, I asked for a refund for the burger and fries. The waitress said she couldn't give me a refund because I had already eaten it. I said that I would be eating it later that day, so she should give me a refund then. She said no. I said I would call the manager and complain. She acted like she didn't care and just told me to come back if I wanted a refund. I've had better service at Taco Bell and McDonald's. I don't know what kind of a business a place like this is trying to run. If you want to make money, don't expect to get good service. The staff here are all too busy looking at their iPhones and texting to give you a decent service. They just don't care. I don't recommend eating here unless you are just passing through and don't have time to go to a nicer place. This place is a dive. If you have to eat here, eat fast and get out of there. There are worse places in San Antonio to eat. The staff are rude and not very friendly. The food is pretty good and the price is reasonable. The only good thing about this place is that they serve food until midnight, so you can get a bite to eat if you're in the mood for a late night snack. It is not a fancy restaurant, but it's not a bad place to eat either. The staff are friendly and the food is good. The prices are also reasonable. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good meal. It's worth the drive. You can't beat the price and the food is good. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is because the service was pretty bad. I have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good.

When I asked for the burger, the waiterwaitress acted like I was some kind of idiot. I had to repeat myself twice before she understood me. She also acted like I was bothering her and acted like I was making her late for work. I was in a hurry so I went ahead and ate my fries and left. When I got home, I asked for a refund for the burger and fries. The waitress said she couldn't give me a refund because I had already eaten it. I said that I would be eating it later that day, so she should give me a refund then. She said no. I said I would call the manager and complain. She acted like she didn't care and just told me to come back if I wanted a refund. I've had better service at Taco Bell and McDonald's. I don't know what kind of a business a place like this is trying to run. If you want to make money, don't expect to get good service. The staff here are all too busy looking at their iPhones and texting to give you a decent service. They just don't care. I don't recommend eating here unless you are just passing through and don't have time to go to a nicer place. This place is a dive. If you have to eat here, eat fast and get out of there. There are worse places in San Antonio to eat. The staff are rude and not very friendly. The food is pretty good and the price is reasonable."
Human,yelp-86,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the wait staff. The last few times we have gone in we are met with an attitude of indifference at the door that seems to permeate the wait staff. Waited a long time to for our first contact with the waitress, though she was pleasant. Seems she had customers on the patio as well as inside and was spread thin, so it was a long time between visits. First beer came timely, but could not get the attention of anyone for a refill when our food came. A different waitress dropped off our food (and that was literally what she did) and quickly turned away and did not ask if we needed anything else. Furthermore, she went out of her way to avoid our conspicuous attempts to get her attention for something we needed. In the meantime our first waitress was busy on the patio and, apparently, waitress 2 was not happy that she had to serve us our food, because she continued to ignore our attempt to get her attention, even glaring and looking through me at one point. Although this was Trivia night (for the life of me I don't understand what a restaurant gets out of this since most participants seem to only buy drinks), the place was not crowded or busy and there seemed to be plenty of employees to go around the room and tend to the customers that were present. This is only an account of the third bad experience we have had with service. There have been others, interspersed with satisfactory experiences. We both have many years in the restaurant business and our assessment of the reason for this uneven experience falls on management. First, choose people that are committed to the success of your business. There are many competitors out there waiting to take your place if you stumble. Second, management has the responsibility to make certain staff is well schooled in how to deal with customers, including the technique of scanning the room and making eye contact with those that seem to be looking for something. There are usually additional sales involved in doing this competently. Third, management needs to be present and observant so that when it is apparent things are not going well, they can do what they are paid to do, i.e. make it right. You only get so many bites at this apple HAPH, so you better get it right or Gilbert ends up with yet another vacant building with a For Lease sign in the window."

And the employees are some of the rudest people I've ever encountered in my life. You would think a manager would have some sort of customer service skills but apparently not. They should put a sign up that says we're a rude store. It would save you the trip. I don't know why she's the manager. The girl that worked there before her had better customer service skills than she does. I had a bad experience at this store, and will not be returning. I've been shopping at ULTA Beauty for a long time. I always try to get my favorite associates when I go in. This last time I didn't get my associate, but the service I received was excellent.

I went to this restaurant in December and the service was very slow. The waitress never came over until I asked her to check if my chicken breast had arrived, which it didn't. This is a nice place to get Mexican food. You can grab some chips or salsa as well so that your meal will not cost too much The drinks are really expensive here for what they serve. Nothing like BUDWEISER NEIPA at 5! It also seems that their margaritas are poisoned because when I'm there often after ordering one it's fine then later on in the evening there's something wrong with it. Food prices aren't cheap (although great value), however the atmosphere is delightful - lovely friendly staff who know how to make an impression! Always good beer though we have had issues elsewhere where folks need to go through customs and get stamped out sometimes... It's ok, except no popcorn... My only complaint is they don't do Happy Hour any more (and I've been going here forever)."

Tsinghua,yelp-92,"This man is CRAZY!!!! If you ever come to Vegas, don't miss his show. The Showroom at the Flamingo is small, so even if you're not sitting up front he's still amazing. He does a bunch of routines in which he uses cards, coins, balls, etc., all from a variety of hands and with no gimmicks. Some of the stuff he does is very old-school. One trick is called the Spider, and I'm not sure it's been done in Vegas for years. It's a card trick that is very simple and looks deceptively hard, and it has an amazing ending. I can't give it away, but if you're into card tricks, you should definitely see it. He does all sorts of crazy stuff with cards, including making a single card disappear from an entire deck of cards, but he also does a lot of other things. He's great at doing an imitation of people, and he can do the routine with the hat and the fez and the white gloves. It's really entertaining, and it's great to see how many different tricks he can do with cards. After the show, he does a freebie trick with a pair of sunglasses. He does it with the fake glasses, then with the real glasses, then with the real glasses over the fake glasses, then with the fake glasses over the real glasses, and so on. I can't tell you which is which. He's really good at that. The show is hilarious and totally entertaining, and it's worth the money. If you're looking for a show to see, this is a good choice. It's definitely worth seeing, and it's definitely worth going to see it. I highly recommend it. The Flamingo Showroom at the Flamingo Hotel Casino is located at 1600 Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, Nevada 89101. The Showroom is a very small, intimate space, so you may have to sit in the balcony. You can also watch the show from the floor, but the floor seats are a bit farther away from the stage, so it's a little less intimate. The Showroom seats 100.

I wish we had more time but he was still amazing and just so fun! The Sky High Tower is awesome and worth seeing from all angles. Define Amazing!!! We went on a Saturday night which meant it wasn't packed as incredibly crowded other times of day (like Friday). They have an elevator that goes straight back down into one of two restaurants; Eataly's or Italian Grille. And then they graciously allowed us in their restaurant when our movie set came thru. It would've been great to go inside ANYONE'S restaurant but we're glad we didn't ask before heading out because we ended up having reservations at another hotel nearby!! There are multiple shops where you can see lots of big star memorabilia including Demi Lovato's bag and Kim Kardashian West shoes. (Kim has her own shop!) Brahms Hall: You can't get tickets online unlike most concert halls, only by calling them directly.

OpenAI,yelp-93,"This was formerly Risque which was the WORST vegas club ever, so it was a relief to hear it was closed down and reopened as a new club. With any new venue, it's important to do your research and read reviews from recent customers to get an idea of what the atmosphere and experience are like. You can also check out the club's social media pages for photos and events to get a better understanding of what to expect. Additionally, it's always a good idea to dress appropriately and arrive early to avoid lines and ensure entry. Have a fun and safe night out!"

You can also get your dance skills tested here with lessons available from Monday through Friday after 2:30PM if you're interested (4 hours for 150). They've got classes like pole dancing salsa too! The music is mostly house but there are plenty of pop tunes thrown into all genres...basically anything mainstream enough not be considered ""alt"" yet still good quality tracks; I feel comfortable saying Bare's played each song 20 times before adding another one even though we may only catch 1 hour max per day when visiting Vegas since my DJing style isn't really conducive towards playing songs over 10x because things start sounding stale very quickly unless mixed correctly however redundancy does keep me going back consistently due how commercial everything usually ends being regardless what genre everyone else always seems obsessed about although nothing beats getting dressed nicely just walking around aimlessly then bumpin' heads woot!!"

With any club that's opened in Vegas, it's always a hit or miss. We went around 12:30AM on a Friday night, and the line was extremely short. The only thing I disliked about the line was that the bouncer was a bit rude. I think the guy was new and wasn't very approachable. Once we got past the bouncer, we saw that the club had a decent size for a new club. The music was good, but my friend and I had to go to the back to get away from the smokers. The drinks were a bit expensive, but not a surprise. Overall, we had a good time at this club."
Human,yelp-94,"I go to the Crown Anchor whenever I'm in the mood for some chicken fingers Chickens don't have fingers! and homemade curry sauce in which to dip them. Yum. The place is dark, which I prefer. They do, indeed, have bangers'n mash on the menu, as well as a Scotch egg (a hardboiled egg wrapped in lightly spiced sausage) and a steak'n kidney pie. If you're hankerin' for the fare of the lovely UK, then this is where you should go. There's only one bit o' beef I got with this place. Due to some sort of.... something.... on their liquor license, you can not order hard likkah at the bar. You have to be seated in the dining area, you have to at least order a plate of fries, and you must have your server bring you said likkah. Kind of a bummer when you've been sitting at the bar with a group of your buddies, and someone has the grand idea of ordering a round of car bombs. Everyone has to get up, go to a table, order some food, wait for the server to bring you your shots.... kind of ruins that whole spur of the moment, Let's do a shot! thing. They do, however, also have sticky toffee pudding. So, basically, go for the food and the beer, but do your drinking elsewhere."
OpenAI,yelp-94,I go to the Crown Anchor whenever I'm in the mood for some chicken fingers Chickens don't have fingers! and homemade curry sauce in which to dip them. Yum. The Crown Anchor sounds like a great place to satisfy that craving! Is there anything else you enjoy eating or drinking there?

For a truly authentic Thai experience head over to House Thai at 777 Grand Ave SE (next door to Hunan). They've been serving up delicious dishes since 1995 and are celebrating 20 years next month! House Thai was founded by two foodies who wanted to bring together classic Thai ingredients with modern American tastes so you could enjoy your favorite foods without losing any flavor. Their menu features appetizers like crunchy coconut shrimp balls paired with sweet and sour red paste or golden fried calamari fries. The most popular dish on their menu? Chicken Tikka Masala, made using high quality meats from Thailand and cooked according to traditional recipes but only available while supplies last because it's always gone fast when out back there."

The Crown Anchor is a great place to go for a casual meal with friends or family. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious. The chicken fingers are perfectly fried and the curry sauce is flavorful and creamy. I always order extra sauce so I can dip my fries in it as well. The Crown Anchor also has a great selection of beers on tap, so you can enjoy a cold one while you eat. One of my favorite things about the Crown Anchor is the atmosphere. It's a cozy and inviting place, perfect for a relaxing meal. The walls are decorated with old photos and paintings, and the lighting is dim and romantic. The tables are close together, so you can easily chat with your neighbors. It's the perfect place to catch up with friends or make new ones.

LLAMA,yelp-94,"I go to the Crown Anchor whenever I'm in the mood for some chicken fingers Chickens don't have fingers! and homemade curry sauce in which to dip them. Yum. The Crown Anchor is what I call a ""strip pub"" - it's located in a strip mall. I'm not sure what that says about me or about my city, but I don't really care. We live in a great town where you can have a great pint and a good meal just about anywhere you want to. If it's in a strip mall, fine. If it's downtown, even better. If it's in a restored historic building, that's nice, too. The Crown Anchor is a great little place with a menu that includes fish and chips and a bunch of other good pub food. And it's just a few doors down from my office, which is a nice perk. Growing up in East Texas, we didn't really have a lot of British-style pubs. We didn't have a lot of Irish pubs, either, and we had almost no Italian pubs. But that's OK, because the British style is the best, and we have lots of those. If you're in the mood for a good fish 'n' chips or some classic pub fare, our local listings can help you find a place. And the menu items are best when washed down with a pint of ale or lager. The English breakfast, for instance, is a staple of the pub menu. It consists of fried eggs, bacon, sausage, baked beans, mushrooms and toast. Add a side of black pudding (pig's blood and oatmeal) for a full-blown heart attack. But it sure tastes good! The British pub has a long history. At one time in England, pubs were gathering places for the upper classes. But pubs have always been the gathering place for the working classes. The two classes used to mix in pubs, but that's not really the case anymore. A few weeks ago, my family and I visited England for a little vacation. We had a blast, and one of the highlights was sitting down at a pub for a good meal and a pint. And that's something you can do right here in River City."

The XXXX Cafe and the Crown Anchor are good for lunch too, if you're after a lighter lunch. Both are also a bit cheaper than most other places in the city.The Smithfield is also great, but it's very popular with the younger crowd, so be prepared to wait in a queue. OMG I've just discovered the Goldfish! Ooh, they're great, and cheap! I used to have them when I was a kid, but now I'm old and fat I'm a bit too scared to go back to the Golden Mile! Where do you get them? I've just had a chat with our lovely neighbours who live at the end of the street and they've said they're a lovely pub, not too expensive and great atmosphere. I'll have to go and check it out! Not just because I live there, but because I used to work in the area, too! lol. Yeah, the Crown Anchor and XXXX are the two most popular places, and I'm sure the Smithfield is a bit like the Smithfield in Edinburgh - which I love! So, if you want to be in the middle of the action, go for the Smithfield. And, as you said, the Goldfish is great, but you need to get there early! When I was a kid, I used to have a lot of treats at the shops in the Crown Anchor, like lollies and the chocolate egg for Easter! I'm going to go there this weekend and get a free lolly from the lad in the store! There's another place in the centre that sells great chocolate eggs too. I love getting free stuff! I think the Crown Anchor is the best pub in town. It's not as nice as the Smithfield, but it's not a bad place to go and eat and drink. They have a 50p pie and mash, which is great. I used to work in the Crown Anchor. It's so funny to read these comments as I am a proud resident of the Goldfish. Guess where I live now?:) Oh, yeah, I've lived in the Goldfish for years, but only just moved into my new flat! So, if you're not too scared of having to climb a flight of stairs, it's a great place to live! The landlord is a lovely guy, too! I'm currently living in the Smithfield too. It's not too bad, but there are a few nicer places to live around the city centre. Anywhere in the Goldfish or Smithfield area is okay, I guess. I think I'd prefer to live in a bigger place in the city centre, though. We used to live in the Crown Anchor for about a year, then we moved out of the city centre. It was good to live near the Crown Anchor, though, because I can walk there and back in about 20 minutes. That's the longest I've ever walked in a pub, though!"
LLAMA,yelp-95,"These guys are thieves! I accompanied my wife to the store one day to have a headlight bulb installed. I tried but was afraid I'd break something, so we let the professionals do it. We didn't have the correct bulb so they sold us one. No big deal. However, when they tried to charge us 29.95 to install it, I knew something was wrong. I asked to see the price list, and it was only 11.95 to install it. I pointed it out to them, and they apologized and gave us the 19.00 back. I'll never go back, especially after reading all the other reviews. They are very bad thieves, my son took his car there to replace a taillight, he left it there and they sent him a letter asking for 2000, the service is terrible, they damage the car and ask for a lot of money to fix it, so they can take the car. I went to AutoZone on Baseline in San Antonio and asked for an oil filter for my car. The guy says he will go out back and get it. He comes back in a few minutes with an oil filter. He asks me what size it is. I told him I had no idea. So he then says he will go out and measure it to make sure it will fit. I am waiting for about 15 minutes and he never comes back. I go out to see what is going on and he is standing out there with another employee laughing and joking. He says he is working on it. Then he starts showing me different oil filters and asking me which one I want. I ask him why is he showing me different oil filters and he says I asked him to show me what they had. The first filter he showed me was the right one. So I was waiting for 15 minutes for him to do something he had already done. I asked him if he was joking with me and he says no. I told him it looked like he was joking with me and he said he was not. I asked him if he was new and he said he was not. I told him I wanted to speak to his supervisor and he said he was the supervisor. Then he started telling me I was stupid and that he could not help stupid people. He told me to get out of his store. Then he came out from behind the counter and started yelling at me and telling me to get out of his store. The other employee had a smirk on his face the whole time. I have never been treated so rudely by any business. This is the worst customer service I have ever received. I will never go back to AutoZone and I will tell everyone I know not to go there."

I'm sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. If you feel that you have been overcharged, you should contact the store management immediately and explain your situation. You can also try contacting the local Better Business Bureau or filing a complaint with your state's attorney general's office.

Our oil is full synthetic and was just changed 2 months prior and only accumulated 3,000 miles since then. The AT has absolutely no issues and shouldn't be flushed so soon; absolutely no reason.

I don't want to use the original chrome shade. I like to save money."" When I asked why he didn't install a chrome shade, he said, ""I can't do that. The metal is too soft."" I was appalled!

Tsinghua,yelp-96,"I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. Thank you for listening to my story. I am so very disappointed in the actions of this store manager. I am now hesitant to shop at any of the Old Navy stores in the area. How can a company like this expect me to continue to shop at their stores when they will not listen to their customers? Customer service is not there at all. I have been a loyal customer for 12 years and have NEVER had any problem. Needless to say, I will be shopping at GAP from now on. You will be losing customers, Old Navy. This is the 2nd time in 2 weeks that I have been treated this way. I called the store the other day and they had my name wrong and so the manager called me back. She did a terrible job. I complained and the manager did not apologize and she just hung up on me. I am so disappointed in this store and the management. This is the second time I have had to contact Old Navy about a customer service issue. I will not shop at any of the stores in the area. I will shop at GAP from now on. You will lose customers. I had a problem with my credit card and the manager could not get a hold of someone. He told me to call the number and I would get my money back in 30 days. I called and the credit card company told me that they had a problem with the charge and I needed to call the manager back. I called the manager back and he said I needed to call the credit card company and they would refund my money. I called the credit card company back and they told me that the charge was valid and I needed to call the manager back. I called the manager back and he said he would get back to me. I called him back and he said that he could not get a hold of someone and he could not do anything. I was very upset and called the manager back and told him that I would call back later. I did call him back and he told me that I could not get a refund because I had not been to the store and did not have the receipt. I told him that I was at the store the day before and that I did have the receipt. I told him that I had already filed a complaint with the credit card company and that I was calling to tell him that he was not helping me. I told him that he needed to call me back because he had not done anything. He told me that he could not call me back because he was out of the office and that I needed to call the credit card company back.

LLAMA,yelp-96,"I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. This manager has no control over her store. The store was a complete mess, clothes on the floor in the men's department, in the fitting room, on the racks. I had to ask for help with the fitting room key. I had to stand in the middle of the store for about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. Then I asked for an employee to help me with a size. I was told that Aundrea Turner, the manager, would help me. I told Aundrea Turner I was waiting for an employee to help me with a size and she told me that she was the only one in the store that could help me. She then proceeded to roll her eyes at me and told me that I was going to have to wait for her to finish helping someone else. I informed her that I would be happy to wait until she was finished helping the other customer. Then she proceeded to ask me for my name and my phone number. I asked her what she needed that for. She stated that she was going to have to call the police if I did not leave. I asked her what I did to deserve that. She said that I was rude and I was harassing the other customer. I was never rude to this customer. I never even spoke to her. The customer was about 300 pounds and I was only asking to get the size of an item. I have worked in retail for over 35 years and I have never been treated like that by anyone, let alone a manager. I will be letting my friends and family know what happened to me and that they should take their business elsewhere. I will be calling corporate and filing a complaint as well."
BigScience,yelp-96,"I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. She is definitely not hard working, she has a long history of being rude to customers (my mom told me) and about two weeks ago I saw her taking orders on her cell phone while talking in front of other employees who were standing there waiting patiently to do their jobs. Not one word did any one say to say something like ""hey that sounds really distracting!"" or even just an ""Oh dear...excuse me please..please stop doing what you're doing and go take care of those people! You can't be busy with your computer all day if you want them to hear you!"" She was so rude when she asked ""maybe we could see this later?.. I'm getting it ready right now... maybe tomorrow night?... ok, I'll put it back out by Tuesday morning!...and then Monday evening.... ok.... 8.30 pm? Oh That's great. Thank you xx. What happened next was more than enough, because after everyone left except me and I had been waiting around 10 minutes to get served due to rush hour traffic, Ms Turner came down chatting away for another 5 minutes before giving us our order!! At least that's how Anne's mother described it! It took 30 minutes to wait for the food once ordered and they only gave us half of everything we wanted although we paid full price based on the menu!!! What kind of customer service can leave you feeling disrespected? Afterwards i went online to review with others but no one would let me post anything negative. No USAA Insurance card, nothing. Please help me understand better. How come the 'old folks' are able to sit at this table without having chair covers over them and why do these chairs need to be cleaned so often? The toilet paper roll holder needs to be adjusted. It doesn't work unless its held up high enough from underneath. There should also be instructions on where you place things such as coffee cups mugs along with some alternative items to hold things. As far as the tableside seating area goes, they're uncomfortable and there's too much space between the seattable top edge and the wall behind the seats. Wonderful time spent visiting with my granddaughter today! We walked into a rave mess: Piled dirty plates, dishes and glasses, smells coming off the meat counter window, food spilt everywhere and soda cans lying around. Nothing was clean. One employee stood in line outside of the entrance trying desperately to find someone who wouldn't mind cleaning up the floor, which he couldn't seem to locate. Then he ran inside to ask his supervisor how many times he'd have to tell him to clean up the restroom. After every visit it's always time consuming to wash hands across multiple surfaces. Add to that the fact that three different staff members stepped directly onto hot dogs laid out on the countertop. If I'd known this would happen I would've brought my own lunch instead of eating here ever since I've moved into the neighborhood. First class experience isn't going to cut it; we've found elsewherebut still disappointed."
OpenAI,yelp-96,I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. I'm sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with the store manager at Old Navy. Have you tried reaching out to their customer service department to express your concerns and see if they can offer any resolution? It's possible that they may be able to address the situation and regain your business.
PaLM,yelp-96,"I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. I went to the Old Navy store in the King of Prussia Mall on Saturday, March 11th, 2023, at approximately 3:30 PM. I was with my 10-year-old daughter, and we were looking for some new clothes for her. We had been shopping for a while, and we were starting to get tired. I went to the front of the store to ask for help finding a size 10 shirt for my daughter. The store manager, Aundrea Turner, was standing at the register, and she immediately offered to help me. I told her what I was looking for, and she said that she would be right back. She went to the back of the store and came back a few minutes later with a shirt in size 10. I thanked her and took the shirt to my daughter. She tried it on, and it fit perfectly. I was happy with the service that I had received, and I was ready to check out. I went to the register and Aundrea Turner rang up my purchase. I gave her my credit card, and she started to process the transaction. Suddenly, she stopped and said that my card was declined. I was confused, because I had just used the same card to buy gas earlier that day. I asked Aundrea Turner what was wrong, and she said that my card had been declined because of suspicious activity. I was shocked. I had never had any problems with my credit card before. I asked Aundrea Turner if she could try again, but she said that she couldn't because my card had been flagged. She said that I would need to call the credit card company to resolve the issue. I was frustrated and embarrassed. I had to leave the store without my daughter's new shirt. I went to the car and called the credit card company. They told me that my card had been flagged because of a recent fraudulent transaction. They said that I would need to file a police report to get my card unblocked. I was furious. I had to go to the police station and file a report, all because of Aundrea Turner's mistake. I went back to the Old Navy store the next day to talk to the store manager about what had happened. She apologized for the inconvenience, but she said that there was nothing she could do to help me. I am so disappointed with the way that I was treated by Old Navy. I have been a loyal customer for years, and I have never had any problems before. I am disgusted by the way that Aundrea Turner handled this situation. She was rude, unprofessional, and condescending. She cost the company my business, as well as the business of my friends and family. I will never shop at Old Navy again. I urge everyone to avoid this store and to let Aundrea Turner know that her behavior is unacceptable."

Human,yelp-96,"I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. All over 9. The whole thing started on Saturday when I purchased 3 dresses for my niece during the one day sale. I bought them at Colonnade. The sale was a one day sale on girls tank dresses for 7. The dresses were clearly marked 7 and there were a mix of solids and print. I bought 3 with prints. The dresses I picked were all from the side of the display rack that had a 7 sign. They weren't just one or two mixed in there were full size runs. The other side of the rack had tunics for 8.50. I was charged 10 each. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until this morning when I looked at the receipt. I live by Arrowhead and that's the location I went to for a price adjustment receipt and dresses in hand. I waited in line for 10 minutes before someone helped me. The cashier checked with whom I assumed to be an assistant manager or lead. I was told that the Arrowhead location didn't have this style (same style just a print instead of solid) on sale but they would call the location I went to for verification. I waited for nearly 10 minutes and in front of me the cashier told the same lead that the Colonnade location had put them on sale for 7 because they had such little inventory of the ones that were actually on sale. He then asked if he should just refund me the difference. She told him no and went to check with the store manager. After waiting another 5 minutes she came back and said if I wanted the price difference I would have to take it to the Colonnade store for a refund. I asked to speak with the manager. We waited 10 more minutes for her to come out. From the start she was defensive and rude. She told me that she called that store (because apparently she didn't believe the employee that had already called them in front of me) and told me that I was wrong they never had the dresses set up like that and if there was a mistake, it was that store's mistake and they would be the ones that needed to fix it not her. That's right. She said. Multiple times actually. I told her I am not driving 25 min to get a price refund and she said I can keep the dresses or return them. I asked for a refund and she told me to get back in line and walked off. This behavior is completely uncalled for by anyone no matter what store it is or what their position is. The price difference wasn't huge and I probably would have kept them. I was even planning on doing some more shopping. My mom even had several items in her hand and put them back. I won't ever be back."

The prices are very reasonable for the type of food. The service is excellent. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The only thing we would change is we would order the jalapeno sauce on the side instead of on the steak. The jalapeno sauce was spicy and good, but it made it difficult to taste the steak as well.

Good prices, fast and friendly service, and a good atmosphere. The food and service were excellent. We will be back. We've been to this restaurant numerous times and every time we go it is delicious.

BigScience,yelp-97,"ehh overrated!! price was ok, but the food was not. Our steak was really thin and dry. We requested medium-rare but what they gave us was overcooked.. other plates didn't have any flavor at all! The portions were small as well. I do recommend this restaurant though to those that are looking for a good Chinese place in San Diego that serves authentic dishes! This is one of my favorite chinese restaurants ever in Los Angeles. It has great customer service and delicious food from starters and main courses right along with desserts. I highly recommend it if you have never been there before- you will love it!!! The service here was excellent, very friendly staff who answered even our last minute questions for an appetizer we wanted to order after dinner had finished. My husband's entree came out perfectly and he enjoyed every bit of his meal. He said it was extremely tasty. This evening took up most of the time during which he worked (he owns a local business) because he ate so much...but I'm glad he did when he felt like eating something like this. I would definitely go back again especially since it's now open 7 days per week instead of only on Saturday night or Sunday morning. While previous reviews state prep takes 45 minutes, ours took about 3 hours total including set-up etc. Waitresses often end up taking up more than half of your wait time; also, some items may be unavailable due to busy schedule. We went twice with family. Not sure how many tables exist inside; however, there's plenty of seating outside. Food was amazing - best I've experienced anywhere. Tried everything: lobster tempura roll, crab dumplings, shrimp i am used to piquant noodles from China. Everything was perfect. Staff members were helpful. Next Gen HQ.

I love this place! The staff was really nice and there were some interesting atmosphere around inside as well. Their pizza has a great flavor also. Great family-style restaurant with kids menu that will entertain. The food is delicious - definitely worth the trip to La Mesa. I am 53 years old and have been eating at Velveeta's since it opened in 1988 when my mom took me out because she thought we had something wrong with us (we're both Italian). I'm still going thru their menus looking up recipes from all these yrs ago! If you can't get enough of their lasagna you should try one of their pizzas- they are phenomenal!!! We went on our way home tonight after buying groceries and stopped by Hometown Pizza for dinner. We got an appetizer platter which included cheese sticks, chicken wings, crispy pork belly strips, green beans, coleslaw, brussel sprouts shrimp salad. It came with several sides including rolls, breadsticks, fries and sweet potato chips. This plate cost 14.00 per person!!! Once you start adding on things you're hungry before you finish your meal. They serve about 5 different kinds of salads each week so price varies depending upon what dayweek. After lunch or dinnertime everyone gets special offers such as half the pie price if you're ordering dessert. Yum! I highly recommend trying out their pizzait's amazing!! This eatery dates back many decades, but they've always maintained high quality standards, remarkably consistent prices despite inflation, excellent customer service. Nothing spectacular though; just OK. Still enjoy it anyhow. My wife has taken over the management of this business. She started off simple with getting rid of too much stuff, cleaning up tables etc., then decided to expand her skills training employees who could work outside of kitchen duties. Now she's working right along side my son as he continues his studies on the other end of town without losing clients or customers. My husband works the desk part time now while she goes into the kitchen and handles the front office. Instead of having 3 full-time workers we're only 2 12. She's learned to do everything herself except cooking which she does amazingly. Since she's learning more about managing people I've become really involved helping whenever possible. Like anyone else we've gone through hard times due to economy. We've had lots of help from friends and neighbors while walking through tough spots. But no matter how bad things seem sometimes you can learn new things that make life easier. Simply the best pizza...not long wait time..great service. I would go anywhere where they're serving real meat pies....very tasty Took hubby there last night for 1 slice of pizza...5 min wait....the pizza is simply beyond belief......hubby loves it..wouldn't eat anything else.......service may be slow,but that's ok... We found ourselves heading towards this little pizzeria late toward the evening knowing nothing whatsoever about it until we saw two cars drive past howling loudly with the volume turned up loudly via music blasting outta the car stereo. However, while instructed by the doorman never to park in line, we did anyway and soon realized why. As far as we knew the parking lot was pretty empty, however, once we entered within minutes someone pulled over beside the entrance to let us know waiting room space was available. So next thing we heard was a barking dog warning us away followed by four young men asking us to follow them directly to their table area which happened to sit near another couple dining alone. When asked whether they wanted pizza we replied yes immediately resulting in the announcement being made known that all pizzas were sold out; however within seconds a short order box arrived containing three slices of pepperoni, mozzarella and basil freshly baked in house that looked extremely appealing. All told we needed to purchase 6 packs totaling approximately 10 just prior to leaving for the final destination of McDonald's located across the street. While agreeable on paying the 5 extra for six small items rather than 4, I felt sorry for those poor children whose parents probably didn't want their precious ones spending money unless absolutely necessary. At least I hope it's not required. Regardless it's a very pleasant experience nonetheless and one we look forward to returning again sometime soon. Not sure if its true or false but most likely them. In my opinion, i think they cook in a decent sized oven. I don't consider them big chains either. Just a local pizzeria"

This is the best pizza I've ever had. I usually order it as a thin crust, but when I tried the thick crust, I was in love.

OpenAI,yelp-98,"I've ordered pizza here for years. It's good, friendly service, quick delivery, and it's down the street. It's not greesy like Napoli's and the crust is amaZING! I love this That's great to hear! Is there anything else you need assistance with regarding your pizza order, or is there anything else I can help you with?"

I love this place and will order from here always. They have tons of other items on the menu but I've always just gotten the pizza."
Human,yelp-99,"Well, it's worse than I thought. One of the teas ended up being over 100 a pound! And even though I immediately returned everything, the money has not shown back up on our credit card account. The charge is there; the return is not. What a lousy way to do business."
LLAMA,yelp-99,"Well, it's worse than I thought. One of the teas ended up being over 100 a pound! And even though I immediately returned everything, the money has not shown back up on my card. The other tea was under 20 a pound, and it was sent back to the warehouse (at my expense!). I'm so upset with myself, because I'm a tea drinker, but I'm not that much of a tea snob! I am a 100 caffeine-free tea drinker (caffeine gives me migraines). I prefer loose tea over tea bags, but I've been using bags for the last few months. I have 4 or 5 different types of tea bags that I'm getting through, and I have a couple more kinds in loose form. It's not like I'm stuck with a limited selection, like I am with my favorite hot chocolate. And I'm not going to be stuck paying an outrageous amount of money for this tea, either. So, I'm going to have to limit my shopping for a while. I have enough tea to get me through the month, and I'm going to have to learn to live with that. It's embarrassing, but it's also a very good lesson. I think it's more frustrating that I can't trust myself to be able to get what I want without completely overdoing it. Labels: money, shopping, tea I can't do it...I just can't! I'm so upset right now. I made an order from Adagio, one of my favorite tea vendors, for several types of teas. What happened next is that I was billed 7x for the same order. I got a confirmation that my order had been shipped, but I never received it. When I went to look into it, I found the multiple billing, and was assured that my money would be refunded. Now I find out that Adagio has shipped me the order! And, I'm still being charged! I am so upset. I ordered some of the teas in a sampler size, and they were 6.99 a pound. I'm going to be charged over 50 for that, and I can't afford that! I'm going to have to return the order. I can't afford to pay that much for tea, and I don't need that much tea in the first place! I'm so upset that I can't even write about it coherently. I feel like I've been ripped off, and it's not a good feeling. Labels: money, ripoff, tea I am having a horrible time with my food allergies right now. I've had a lot of swelling in my face, and I've been having a lot of itching and hives. I have an appointment to see my allergist next week, and I'm hoping that he'll be able to figure out what's going on. I've been trying to cut back on my eating. I'm trying to stick to fruit and veggies and dairy. Unfortunately, I'm feeling so badly that I'm not really able to cook. I'm not even able to eat out because it's so bad. I am trying to figure out what I can do about it. I know that I have to figure out how to get a better diet, but I don't know what else to do. I'm also trying to cut down on my caffeine intake. I've been relying on caffeine to help me get through the day, but I think that it's actually making me feel worse. So I'm trying to cut down on the amount of caffeine that I take in, and trying to avoid coffee. I still drink a lot of tea, and I'm trying to cut down on the black teas and drink more caffeine-free varieties. I'm still drinking my hot chocolate, but I'm trying to drink less of that as well. I feel like I'm in a constant state of caffeine withdrawal, and it's not fun. So I'm trying to make healthier choices, but it's not easy. I feel like I'm doing a poor job, but I'm doing the best I can. Labels: allergies, caffeine, diet, food Yesterday was my birthday"
Tsinghua,yelp-99,"Well, it's worse than I thought. One of the teas ended up being over 100 a pound! And even though I immediately returned everything, the money has not shown back in my account. I'm really very upset. The Tea Rooms are run by this company. I can't find the names of the staff in the store. The best I can do is to say the guy who did my purchase is a guy named Jack (not sure if that's a last name or a first name). And he's not in the store anymore. I'm not sure how much money they've taken, but I do know it's a lot. What should I do? I went to the same Tea Rooms store to see if I could find out what happened. The manager was very nice, and said that he was aware of the problem and would take care of it. However, he didn't know how much they'd taken. I asked him if he would refund the money, but he said he couldn't do that because he wasn't the one who took the money. He did say that he would put the money back into my account as soon as he found out how much they'd taken. I'm waiting for that to happen. In the meantime, I've asked them to stop accepting any other orders from me. It seems that they are a bit more efficient than most companies, and have a very good reputation for tea. They are supposed to be owned by a company called The Tea Rooms, and they're supposed to be located at 1300 Franklin Street, Suite 300. I'm not sure if that's the actual address, but that's where they have a shop. I do hope that they will return my money. I really do enjoy their teas. It's a shame they're taking advantage of customers. Thursday, May 13, 2007 My aunt and I were out to dinner at a restaurant in River Oaks (a restaurant chain that has several locations around Houston). The restaurant is called FG Restaurants, and they have a location at 4500 Eastheimer Road. We had just finished our dinner, and I had one glass of wine. As I was walking out, the waiter said, ""You're not supposed to drink that."" He said it was a rule. I said, ""I'm a doctor, and I know better than that."" The waiter then took my plate and said, ""We'll put it in the kitchen."" So I took my plate back to the kitchen, and they put it back on the table. The waiter then took the plate, and I asked him, ""How long is this going to take?"" He said, ""Well, it's a pretty big table."" So I said, ""Well, just put it back on the table, and I'll just eat it."" So he put it back on the table, and I ate my meal. We left, and as we were walking out, the waiter said, ""We'll put your glass back on the table when you get home."" I said, ""I'm a doctor, and I know better than that."" And he said, ""Okay."" The funny thing is, I'm not even sure what the rule is. It doesn't appear to be on their website. I'm not sure if I can prove this, but it does seem like the waiter was just making up the rule to get rid of me. I've had plenty of conversations with other waiter's who are just trying to get rid of me, too. It's really quite annoying. I have to wonder why a restaurant would make up a rule just to get rid of a customer. Do you know of any other restaurants that do that? What do you think of it? Tuesday, May 11, 2007 My girlfriend's boyfriend is the nicest guy I've ever met. He's very thoughtful, and he does all sorts of little things for her. For example, one day when we were in the hospital, he made sure that she was taken care of, and then he came back to my room. And he did it without me knowing it. He just sat there and waited for me to wake up. He really cares about her, and he's always trying to do things to make her happy. I know he really likes her, and he wants to marry her. And he's been talking about it for a while. So I told him, ""You know, if you really like her, you should ask her."" So he did. And she said, ""Yeah, I'd like to marry you."" I'm really happy for them."

I'm starting to worry that I'm never going to see that money again. I'm really starting to regret making that purchase.

Andre got the ribeye with veggies instead of the traditional sides and he was very happy with it. He raved about it and told the sever how fantastic it was. Carlos (the owner and chef) came out to our table and talked with us about it and Andre told him again how fantastic it was. We'll definitely be back!"

For our entrees, we ordered the chicken gyro, chicken shawarma, and we shared the tabbouleh and the baba ganoush. Everything was delicious, especially the chicken shawarma. I'm excited to come back and try more dishes! Great food and very good service. I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out with my husband. The food was amazing. The service was excellent and the food was good! I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate and it was superb. The shawarma was tender and juicy. It was so good that I forgot to put the garlic sauce on my chicken. The tabbouleh salad was fresh and flavorful. I will definitely go back again! We got here around 9:45pm, which was 15 minutes before closing time. We were able to order and eat our food before they closed. The waitress was super nice and attentive. We ordered the chicken and beef shawarma plates. They were really good! I have a sensitive stomach and I did not get sick at all! The garlic sauce was delicious. Everything was so fresh! The only thing is that we were not offered water. We had to ask for water. I guess it's because they were closing and we were the only ones there. We ate here yesterday evening for dinner. Food was excellent as was service. The waitress was very accommodating. We had the beef Shawarma and the chicken Shish Tawook. We shared a small order of the hummus appetizer. They also have a small salad with the dinner, which is a mixture of greens with a light dressing. All in all, very good food and service. If you're looking for a Middle Eastern meal, this is the place to go. We stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and ordered the chicken shawarma and the chicken shish tawook. Both were very good. The chicken shawarma was a little dry but had great flavor. I would recommend adding a little hummus to moisten it up a bit. The shish tawook was very good and the garlic sauce was amazing. The chicken shawarma plate comes with a salad, which is a nice addition. Overall, we had a great experience and the staff was very nice.

BigScience,yelp-100,"Came here with my boyfriend and had a great time. Iris was our server and she was fantastic. Very knowledgable and friendly. We ordered the hummus and it was pretty good, but too much salt for me (not sure if that is common). The pita breads were also delicious! I am amazed by this restaurant! Great food at very fair prices - home delivery included on all meals. The staff are superb in every way from start to finish. Always welcoming and eager to please even when asked politely not to do so. I've lived in the area now for over 8 years... and have never been able to find an authentic Lebanese restaurant along Westside Avenue until I found Tabrizian.... It's like they knew we would be there waiting for them because once inside you just can't leave without trying their specialties.... We went last night after reading some reviews of what others said about Tabrizian and wow.....it could've been any other place except 'Tabrizian'..we received beautiful greeting as soon as we walked into the room. Our server was the sweetest person ever; he helped us choose dishes before even ordering anything. He explained everything clearly... I'm originally from Lebanon where my family has owned a small dining establishment called 'Lebanese Tavern' since 1967. My husband comes home most weekends to take care of his parents while I'm out working full-time and it's always one of the first places he'll ask to go whenever he's back in town. Since we've started visiting Tabrizia's regularly I've wanted to give them another try thanks to you, it's finally happened and we're more than satisfied. Wonderful service!! Good quality food! Amazing value! All the items on the menu are worth getting excited about!! Dallas, TX, October 10, 2019 - Mosaic announces its support of the Dallas Cowboys' Sunday Night Football matchup against Washington State today, Oct. 16. To mark the occasion, Mosaic will honor the iconic team's uniforms through street art activities throughout downtown Corpus Christi during pregame warmups. In addition to the painted murals lasting approximately two weeks beginning Thursday, the company has partnered with local artist Jaedyn Jones to create an interactive video wall as part of Street Art Fest highlighting three cowboy-themed art pieces created specifically for the event by Houston-based artists Claudia Jagerlund-Smith and Jeana Dillon Rawlings, who respectively live and work in Austin. ""As the official paint supplier to Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers and National Hockey League's Dallas Stars, why shouldn't we get up close and personal with the world's largest sports franchise?"" says Karen Solis, vice president of corporate communications for Mosaic. ""From watching rookie quarterback Dak Prescott tear off in 2018 to winning Super Bowl LIV last week - no matter your viewpoint or perspective - the love these fans feel for Team Maverik will resonate regardless. It's exciting to see how engaging our products can become across diverse industries such as sports and music, making our brands relatable to people everywhere. By investing directly in the community, it's mission-oriented business play that truly evokes emotion and engages consumers."" At the end of September, Mosaic announced it planned to donate 1 million towards the citywide restoration project in San Antonio, which includes 1.3 miles of streetscape improvements and enhancements, including new bike lanes and pedestrian paths, sidewalks, bicycle racks, stormwater retention areas, benches, fencing and lighting systems. As part of efforts to continue supporting the city following construction, Mosaic will host a panel discussion featuring architect Rick Johnson, civil engineer Thomas Pleasance (both of Engineers Without Borders) and former architect Mark Wittek (of RBWA), moderated by design critic David Remick Wednesday, Nov. 2 at 7 p.m., followed by a reception held at Town Square Gallery at 121 S. Main St. in Downtown San Antonio. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg recently praised the partnership between City Hall, the Arts District Association Inc. (ADA) and the private sector to revitalize downtown: ""The goal of redevelopment projects around the country is to make cities sustainable financially while increasing vitality, attractiveness and livability. Construction companies often benefit when they help improve infrastructure and rejuvenate neighborhood centers. It speaks volumes that Mosaic has chosen to participate alongside other organizations like ADA and the non-profit Center for Urban Renewal in raising funds needed to rehabilitate historic properties near downtown restaurants. This collaboration proves McAllen's resilience and ability to thrive despite challenges presented by COVID-19, economic uncertainty and record-breaking flooding. I'm proud that Mosaic has decided to raise money locally and I look forward to seeing the positive impact these investments will have on creating healthy communities within Texans' own hometowns."""

She has to much attitude for a fast food place. I don't plan on ever going back in that store again. We ordered our food and we went to the pick up window, but no one was there. We waited for a while and finally someone came to the window and asked if we had ordered. She left and came back with a bag of food. She then said, ""did you get your drinks?"" I asked her if we had ordered drinks. She replied, ""I don't know."" I asked her again if we ordered drinks and she finally said, ""I guess you did."" We didn't get our drinks because she didn't understand how to ring up a meal. This took about 10 minutes of my time."

Tsinghua,yelp-101,"I was in on Saturday about 8:30 I didn't get the name of the big blonde women that took my order she reeked of alcohol, wasn't very friendly towards me but I wasn't there long enough to talk to her about that. I also was told by the waiter to have fun, by the way I had 3 beers, but that was the most friendly thing I was told by the staff. But I think they were just being polite because they were in the middle of a busy shift. I did order 2 orders of their steak and 1 order of pasta and 2 bottles of their wine, but the waiter forgot to bring the wine, so I asked him to bring it and he said no, that I would have to ask the owner, I was then told to go find him. I left the restaurant and he called me back and said the owner was on his way. I waited 5 minutes, then I called back and he said the owner wasn't in, so I said I would call back later. I left and he called me back and said the owner was in and he was bringing me my wine, but I was then told to have fun and to not wait up, because he would be coming back later. I thought that was rude and unprofessional. I never did get the wine and the owner never came back. The waiter and waitress I spoke to were rude and unprofessional. I did give them a 4.5 star rating on Trip Advisor, because they had a great atmosphere, but the staff was not friendly or professional. I'm so glad I read all of the reviews on this site before I went. We took our family out for dinner last night (122016) and my family and I were treated very poorly by the staff. I am 62 and had never been treated this way in a restaurant. I will NEVER eat at this place again. The owner needs to do something about his staff. We were seated in the back of the restaurant and our waiter did not come to our table until we were told to sit down by the waitress who was a few tables away. I told her that I had asked to be seated there and she said it was too loud and it would be a problem. I asked for a drink and was told that there were no drinks. I asked to speak to the manager and he said he was on his way. The owner never showed up. I told the waitress that we would not be ordering food. She then told me that I could order food and I could get a glass of water. She took our order and we were told that we would not be getting our food until the manager arrived. When he finally showed up he took our order and then said that we could not have our food until the check was paid. We told him that we would not be paying and that we would leave. We told the owner that we would be leaving and he told us to go ahead. When we left the manager called us and told us that he had to apologize for the way that we were treated. He also told us that he had to make up for the problem that he had caused us. We were so upset that we were almost in tears. We were very upset that we had to leave because of this. We were also upset that we were not served our food. I will never eat at this restaurant again and I am so glad that I read all of the reviews on this site before we went. We ate here last night. The service was slow. The food was good but the food came cold. We had a 3 hour wait. There were several people waiting at the same time. The server was very rude. I had asked the server to make sure the salad dressings were made to order. He did not get back to me. When I asked for the salad dressings they were all mixed. I had to ask for a 2nd dressing. I ordered steak. When I asked for it to be cut it was not. The food was good but the server was rude. It took a long time for the server to get back to me. The server did not return my order for 30 minutes. When I asked the server about my order he said ""Oh that's too bad."" I ordered a drink and it came out of a mason jar. I would not recommend this restaurant. There were several people waiting at the same time. I would say that the wait was about 3 hours. I had 2 drinks, and then I got my food. The steak was not well done. I had to ask the waitress for the dressings. I asked for the salad dressings to be made to order. I did not get them. I asked for the steak to be cut, and it was not. The food was good but the service was not good. I was served in a mason jar."

BigScience,yelp-102,"While several dishes were very good i.e. falafel and hummus, twice we have been burned by entrees. A roast chicken was obviously reheated and came out with a rubberlike texture; the second could not be identified at all so I asked for it to be removed from my order but someone else had ordered one too. I am an Arab woman who has spent her life in the United States of America however she is born and raised in Dubai as well. We both like Middle Eastern foods such as: kofta, shawarma burgers, baba ghanoush, etc... These are our favorite meals! My husband likes Indian food also (which he usually orders) but we don't eat fish or shellfish (my husband). He prefers grilled items instead. (He isn't sure if this will ever change). Anyway, when we go there we try many different things until we find something that we really love and would never miss eating again! (we may get tired trying). This place wasn't bad except their bread basket breads weren't fresh. They even gave me black olives that tasted vaguely burnt! But overall nice! We have eaten here on two separate occasions. The first time they actually prepared another meal while waiting for us which made it more enjoyable. Second time there was ice cream that was too sweet just right after dinner. Otherwise our experience with staff excellent and always pleasant and helpful. Would recommend Smoothies breakfast bowls are the best as far pt food goes, especially during times where you dont want anything heavy"

PaLM,yelp-102,"While several dishes were very good i.e. falafel and hummus, twice we have been burned by entrees. A roast chicken was obviously reheated and came out with a rubberlike texture. The other time the dish was a grilled salmon, which was also rubbery and not very fresh. We were disappointed and won't be going back."

Eleuther-AI,yelp-103,"I was shocked to see the relatively decent reviews on Yelp as I had a pretty awful experience here. While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my mother-in law's doctor and am going off of her review when she told me how bad this place is! The office staff are rude (though they have no idea who or what Dr Shilpa Rajesh Bhatia even does!), wait times were ridiculously long time for an appointment that didn't start until 15 minutes late because there wasn"" t enough room in their schedule... Staff seemed more concerned about making sure people got out quickly than being good at doing it themselves - multiple emails left asking if we could reschedule our appointments by last minute after getting into town several days before since all 4 providers couldn"" talk together over email). The first provider felt like he gave us just 5 mins tops each visit despite leaving his home phone number so hopefully someone else can help with anything further needed? And then once back again not only did another person need extra attention but spent 10 min trying random things do get something checkedchecked properly which quite frankly should be obvious from looking them up online reading medical journals... Then worse still while waiting 20min total including lunch break AND THEN ONCE AGAIN AFTER FINALLY GETTING AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE HIM FOR THE QUALITY CHECK HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THEM???!!?? NOTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH OR FITS SO JUST TOLD US WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT A NEW SET OF XRAYS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL WRONG?! But honestly needs one serious rethink based upon age mobility issues due too falls etc.. Really hope other patients won;ts find him such lousy care."""
LLAMA,yelp-103,"I was shocked to see the relatively decent reviews on Yelp as I had a pretty awful experience here. While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my fellow Yelper and am going to do you a favor and save you from wasting your time and money at this place. The first problem I had was that they wouldn't give me a table until my entire party arrived. I understand that this is a common policy in other places, but it's also something I have never seen enforced in the Bay Area before. We had a big party (8 people) and they were holding the entire table for us. However, there was plenty of room to seat half of the party when we arrived 5 minutes after the reservation. I'm glad the hostess made this policy clear to us, otherwise we would have had to awkwardly tell the hostess that we needed to split the table half way through our meal. The second problem I had was the service. The service was extremely slow and the waitress was not very knowledgeable about the menu. We had a waiter who was knowledgeable and attentive, but he was not our primary server and only came to our table once or twice during our meal. The food itself was pretty good, but not mind blowing. They have a lot of cute decorations, but the ambiance was nothing special. It was a very noisy place to have dinner, as the restaurant is quite large and very open, and the people there seemed to be getting pretty hammered. They were playing music (loudly) and it felt more like a lounge than a restaurant. The chairs are also very uncomfortable, so if you plan on staying for a while, bring a cushion to sit on. I would suggest going to a different restaurant in the area like The Old Clam House, Scoma's, or Fog Harbor Fish House. You'll have a much better experience, especially if you're going with a large party."

I think you would do well to realize that a woman's time is not valuable just because she works in a restaurant. We don't have 24 hour shifts to do so. We have lives outside of work and we don't have time to wait on the likes of you. I also think you would do well to remember that women are not required to make every single decision in a restaurant. There are only 2 of us in the restaurant and we don't have time to answer every single question you have. You have a wife, a daughter, a sister and a mother. You have other people in your life. Granted, I don't know you, but I can say that if you were one of my own family members I would be ashamed of the way you treated them. Thank you for your feedback.

While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my friend and hope this helps in your decision making (with one caveat...you do need an attorney). On April 15 2012 at about 12:30 EDT Jack was driving his car when he lost control of it going left onto Old State Road 644. He slammed into another vehicle traveling right coming from the southbound lanes from Old Bridge Rd, then crashed through some fence wire that is outside a building. Jack's car flipped over sideways three times landing him upright after each impact with both vehicles hitting him head-on...he suffered multiple lacerations and abrasions throughout his body including broken collarbone, sprained ankle and shattered teeth etc.. Additionally he has a mild concussion which may require x-rays later today. The driver of the other vehicle also sustained minor injuries. Neither were injured badly enough for immediate treatment but will be seen by their doctors soon. Jack was taken to Trusch Dr. before being transported to UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center where he is currently receiving medical care. His neck injury requires several days recuperation time with physical therapy, X-rays and possibly surgery if necessary... At this point we haven't received any insurance information either way but help is available so please contact us if possible! Please keep me updated...if anything changes I'll let you know straight away via our Facebook page or direct message thru our website Thank you to everyone who sent condolences prayers! We have been told that there are no charges regarding this incident. The costs associated with paying damages incurred due to this accident would fall upon our own resources. Our main concern now is ensuring that Jack recovers completely and continues living life like everyone else without fear from pain and discomfort. While we still await news on whether the legal process has begun vs not yet started, please read below to find out how you can support Jack amidst all things related to recovering from such serious damage to his body:"

My stay at Hotel Continental Paris Gare Du Nord has been one of absolute luxury experience. It's located seconds away from the famous Notre Dame cathedral which I visited twice during that week alone (not counting countless other times throughout my life).

Eleuther-AI,yelp-106,"Bright, huge, friendly, cheap! I have to admit I have a bias because any bar with a ping-pong table in it would have to work hard not to get 5 stars from me. But this is one of the best ones on Columbia Road and as such deserves its rating - even if you don't like pool or darts (there are 9 other games available). The TVs showing sport do tend towards American sports which will annoy lager fans but there's usually something interesting going down at The White Bear so try out their 2 pints Friday night when they offer some great speciality draught beers: Tecate Lights for example...and probably better than what your local offers! Food wise? Well we went during our lunch break today had 2 Budweisers each without feeling hungry an hour later........"

This place is great for group outings, especially if you're planning on staying late - they have a pool table, foosball table, and dart boards. Their beer selection is impressive, and they have a nice wine list as well. The food is pretty good for bar food (their burgers are especially good), and the prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun. This is my go-to bar when I'm looking for a good time with friends."

Also, they have a large list of craft beers. We've gone to a few other craft beer bars in the city and they always have 2-3 IPAs on tap but this place has 6! And if you're the type of person who likes to drink and play games all night, this place is perfect. If you want to sit around a table and drink and chat, this place isn't for you. You'll get a good crowd. The staff are really friendly and helpful. I've never had a bad experience. They have a list of food items and it's not a bad selection.

BigScience,yelp-106,"Bright, huge, friendly, cheap! I have to admit I have a bias because any bar with a ping-pong table in it would have to work hard not to get 5 -star ratings on Yelp. But this one does. On the first night of my trip, we had decided to go for an early dinner. It was 8:30pm and crowds were breaking up everywhere else so I figured we'd skip out on dinner at some fancy restaurant (I know we're all guilty) and head straight back home instead. So off we went looking for somewhere convenient that served hot food around 9 or 10. After searching through several options, we finally found ourselves seated at the kitchen counter with our choice of three entrees - beef ribeye steak, deep fried sweet potato fries, and shredded cheese dippers. The meat itself is delicious. When you bite into it it's tender but chewy without falling apart and has just enough kick from the seasoning. There are also plenty of sides available including veggies, potatoes, rice, etc. If you're feeling generous let them give someone who didn't order anything as well. This place rocks when it comes to drinks. I'm sure most people wouldn't expect such large bottles of beer here since they tend to be focused more towards wine than booze these days, but there is no shortage of Heineken's, Stella Artois', and Budweiser... if you can even find those. The prices aren't exactly dirt-cheap, and while they're reasonable considering what you get, they do definitely feel like you could only afford yourself half of each drink unless you ordered multiple times over. Still though, it's pretty worth it! They serve pizza too, which seems to take the cake among their other offerings. We tried the pepperoni slice that came with marinara sauce and mozzarella sticks, both of which tasted great and were really good sized portions. They've got lots of different kinds of pizzas to choose from depending on your preferences; crusts come in bread style, thin crust, soft shell, brick, and ciabatta. And what's more? All the dough is made fresh every day by hand from scratch so it always boasts a nice fluffiness."

Tsinghua,yelp-108,"Very expensive 19.99 per person for week end and children 12 years old count as an adult, coffee very cold then I ask to reheat the waitress then want to charge me for the hot water. Just because you ask for hot water is no reason to charge for it, plus if you have cold water why should I pay for it. Good food and service, but this is too expensive for my family. We eat here almost every time we are in Birmingham. The service is always good, and the food is always excellent. I will not eat anywhere else but here. We were expecting a lot from this restaurant as it is on our way to the Birmingham races, but were disappointed. The food was pretty average and very expensive. The food is not a big issue, but the atmosphere and service were poor. The lady at the table next to us had been waiting for over an hour to be served and then was refused a table at all. The staff did not seem to be bothered about the fact that they were a few minutes late to serve her. Food was average and very expensive. The coffee was cold. Will never return to this restaurant. We were not disappointed at all! We have been going here for years and have always had a fantastic experience. We were really impressed with the service and the food. The 2009 version of this restaurant was really nice. It is now a really nice modern restaurant. The service was excellent. The food was good. It is a little expensive for what you get but it is what you pay for. We will go back. A friend recommended this restaurant and we decided to give it a try. Our waitress was fantastic and the food was excellent. The meat and vegetables were fresh and tasty. The menu is extensive. It was very well priced and the service was excellent. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. We have been to this restaurant many times and always had a great time. This time was no exception. The food was fantastic, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was good. This restaurant is one of the best in Birmingham. We will definitely be going back again. This is the second time we have eaten at this restaurant. We have been on a date, on a business lunch and as a treat for our daughter. The food is excellent, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is great. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. We were really disappointed with this restaurant. It was really busy and we were waiting for over an hour to be served. The food was not good and was very expensive. We are going to avoid this restaurant from now on. This is a lovely restaurant. The service was good, the food was excellent and the atmosphere was nice. We will definitely be back. We went to this restaurant for a special dinner for a friend's birthday. We were not disappointed. The service was good and the food was excellent. We will definitely be going back to this restaurant. We were recommended this restaurant by a friend and we were not disappointed. The service was good and the food was excellent. The atmosphere was great and we will definitely be going back.

The property was really clean, but lacked some basic amenities such as soap. The staff were excellent - helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble. I understand that although this is a beachfront hotel there are also shops nearby which offer many more choices than what we found in Cabo San Lucas itself (which offered little). There isn't any cable television reception at all except on one particular channel and none if you don't have internet access. We had booked a larger suite because we'd read friends' reviews about how nice these suites were. We opted for 1 bed rather than 2 bed; we chose lounge chairs instead of two small armchairs since they didn't seem practical; we wanted a balcony rather than just outside door leading into courtyard or garden area like other reviewers recommended... etc. But it's hard to say why the rooms did not live up to expectations given their description, location, price point, etc., when there's been no mention of any complaints other than poor telephone reception. 2) Be warned NOT TO GO HERE IF YOU ARE A FATHER WITH YOUNG CHILDREN: Our family was here for our daughter's wedding weekend. Children under 8 can play safely outdoors in the courtyardopen-air gym below-equipped by pool side. However, even though kids could be seen playing happily in the open air while parents sat down in the sun around the poolside bar, the noise level coming through the windows from upstairs made my wife feel quite uneasy for her own well-being! She asked us to move away after turning off certain lights she felt uncomfortable with. (It was still pleasant enough for younger people who weren't bothered.)"

PaLM,yelp-109,"This place is the worst. Of course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books, so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to exist. The head librarian, Ms. Finch, is a power-hungry control freak who rules the library with an iron fist. She's constantly micromanaging everyone, and she's quick to punish anyone who steps out of line. If you're late returning a book, you're automatically fined 50 cents. If you're caught talking in the stacks, you're banned from the library for a week. And if you're caught reading a book that Ms. Finch doesn't approve of, you're expelled from the library for life. It's no wonder that the library is so empty. Everyone who knows what's good for them stays away. But I'm not like everyone else. I'm a rebel. I'm not afraid of Ms. Finch or her tyrannical regime. I'm going to stand up for what I believe in, even if it means getting thrown out of the library. So here's to all the rebels out there who are fighting for a free and open library. We may be outnumbered, but we will not be silenced. We will fight for our right to read whatever we want, whenever we want, and however we want. Down with the tyranny of Ms. Finch! Long live the free library!"

I think it was one of the students who told me that they actually burned the trash out of the dumpsters, because that's the only way to get rid of them. Trash is never allowed to be thrown in the dumpsters. They had to go to the dumpsters to pick up the trash, and they made sure that the trash was thrown back in the dumpsters, because if it wasn't they'd burn it out. It was a big issue.

Sophia's voice fell into silence for an instant, but this time it was because she'd heard what I just said. A silent moment passed before her eyes widened in horror at me, then they started clicking rapidly back and forth with rage while her jaw dropped open like someone had tried to crush it against something rusty.

Every time I walk into this library, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells wondering what rule I might break next. And God forbid they catch your child with a Goldfish cracker in the kids section...off with their heads! Additionally, once it was off limits to SavoyMahomet residents, I felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable. I do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it. Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes? And the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there. I thought that was the point of a library? To excite people about reading and give FREE ACCESS TO ALL. Champaign Public library (which it really isn't anymore) is truly the most unfriendly library I have ever been to and I will never go back there again."

LLAMA,yelp-109,"This place is the worst. Of course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books...so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to exist in the history of the world. First of all, this place is the land that time forgot. They still use a card catalog, there are no computers to be seen, the desk is entirely wooden, and there are no plugs for chargers. You'll have to go outside if you want to charge your phone. If you want to take a book out of the library, you have to get a permission slip signed by your parents. I thought it was a joke, but no. I'm 16 and I still have to get my parents to sign a permission slip for me to take a book out of the library. They have a selection of computers, but if you want to use them you have to sign up on a wait list. The only way to sign up is to go into the library and request a number. The librarians, however, are so busy they rarely give you the numbers you request. There was one instance where I asked for 3, but got 45 instead. The librarians are like angry book hobbits. They stare at you from their lofty desk, which is situated in such a way that it makes you feel like you're in the principal's office. They scowl at you when you look at the books. I almost expected one of them to grab me by the ear and drag me out the door for daring to touch a book. It's like they're looking for ways to make the library less enjoyable. For example, the librarians will not let you sit at the computers unless you are actively using them. If you want to sit down and read a book, you have to sit at the tables in the middle of the library where everyone can see you. If you want to read in peace, you have to go outside. The only good thing about this library is that it has free wi-fi. But you can't use it unless you're a student at the university, which means that if you want to use the wi-fi you have to sit on a wooden bench outside the library and pray that the sun doesn't melt your face off."
BigScience,yelp-110,"Just dined here a week ago. Seriously, the best damn ribs you'll ever taste. My friends are still talking about the finger lickin' good ribs. I also tried their elk burger and can't really put into words how amazing that was! The fries were very tasty too. We went to Sear's in Saugatuck on Saturday night for dinner with my friend Jeff (who works there). We ordered everything from the menu except for beer as we had just come out of a raging funk due to starting a new job last Friday. When our food arrived all 4 dishes came cold even though the waitress said she called up ahead of time that it would be ""just like"" what we'd get! Heat didn't seem to magically appear at some point during delivery both after ordering AND when we sat down!!! All 3 steaks were so soggy they wouldn't have lasted more than 1 minute or 2 cooked which is unacceptable!! Neither beef nor pork could possibly meet this description!! I got a steak combo meal - roast turkey breast, saute mushrooms broccoli, mash potato, fried green tomatoes, cheddar cheese polenta - I paid 29 total including tax. Very expensive but great quality! Yesterday while driving by town I saw a sign advertising another great restaurant called Philly Diner.. I drove over looking forward to eating my pizza...Entering the building you are greeted immediately by many familiar faces.... Some loudly singing Yankee Doodle while others humming The drinking contest begins right away..... Yup you guessed it their drink specials run every day from 10am til deepest dark hour!!!!"

You can't go wrong with the specials, but if you're in the mood for a little fine dining, go for the rib special. I'm just glad I made it out of there before they run out of ribs. 55 ribs (as a side) - I ordered the ""Super"" ribs. The side of fried okra was excellent, and the slaw was very tasty. The ribs were moist and tender, and they went down so easy! The house-made bread was excellent, and I enjoyed the fresh juices and desserts as well. I highly recommend trying this place, and I'm looking forward to returning to try the chicken! I was in the area and stopped in for dinner. We were seated promptly and we were given the key to the bathroom. The restaurant was not very busy and the staff was friendly. The restaurant has an upscale, classy feel to it. I ordered the pork ribs, they were a bit tough, but they were the best ribs I have had in a long time. They did have a small dessert menu and we chose the cookies, they were pretty good. We both had the chicken parmigiana and it was delicious. Overall, this restaurant is a classy, upscale place that has good food. They have a great salad bar, and the desserts are pretty good. The service was good and we were given an appetizer and desert to share. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice date night or dinner with your family. We visited as a group of 6 for dinner on 11102011. The service was excellent and very friendly. Our server, Jane, was very knowledgeable about the menu and was always ready to help us. She was attentive and timely with our food orders and did a great job with our table. We ordered the following: a basket of bread, 4 hunks of ribs, 2 orders of chicken parm, and 2 orders of potato salad. We had a salad bar as well. The ribs were excellent, and the chicken parm was so good I will be making that for myself. The potatoes were ok, and the salad bar was very good. My wife and I ate the salad bar for our entree, and I ordered a side of ham and the potatoes. Both were very good. My wife had the garlic bread and she enjoyed that. The portions were generous and the food was excellent. We will be back to try the chicken and steak dishes. This is a very nice restaurant with good food and a good wine list. We had the ""steak dinner"" which consisted of a baked potato, salad, and the steak. It was served with a baked potato and salad, but it could have been a meal by itself. It was very good, and it was well-cooked. The steak was 10oz. and very tender. It was well-seasoned. It was very nice to have the service of a server.

Tsinghua,yelp-111,"First impression of the place: walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights. No one at the reception desk to greet you, no where to really sit. Once inside, there was a reception desk, a handful of waiting rooms, and a couple of rooms for examining patients. The waiting rooms were uncomfortable and cold. Receptionist told us to wait in a room, and then we were taken to a tiny examination room with a cold, unfriendly nurse. She explained the procedures, and then she gave us the option of a breast exam or ultrasound. We opted for the ultrasound. Then she sent us out to wait for a tech to come back with the ultrasound machine. After about 10 minutes, the tech came back and we went into another room. The ultrasound was about 2 minutes long, but it felt like forever. The nurse said the images would take a few minutes to download, but it felt like forever. The tech returned with a printout of the images and handed it to me. It was pretty clear that we needed to come back for a consultation. The nurse explained that the doctor was out, but he was going to be back soon. She told us to go wait in the waiting room for about 30 minutes. I was about to cry. I thought this was it. I was told we were pregnant, but the doctor was out. I had to come back. So I waited. I tried to get my bearings, tried to keep calm, but I was starting to feel scared. After about 20 minutes, a man with an unkempt beard and a hard look on his face walked in and sat down in the chair across from me. He was very blunt. He asked if I was sure I wanted to get pregnant. I was nervous, but I told him yes. He asked if I had any health issues. I told him I had a miscarriage about 6 months ago. He asked me if I had been on any medications recently. I told him I had been on Zoloft, and that I had been taking it for about a year. He asked me if I had been on any other medications. I told him I was on Xanax, but that it was prescribed for anxiety. He asked me if I had been on any other medications, and I said yes, and then I started to cry. He asked if I had any other questions. I asked him if he was sure he wanted to get the ultrasound done. He said yes. Then I asked him if he had any questions for me. He said he did, and I said yes. I asked him why I had to wait 20 minutes for an ultrasound when I had been told I was pregnant. He said that we needed to wait for a few minutes for the ultrasound tech to get back with the ultrasound machine. I asked him if I could have a copy of the ultrasound report.

LLAMA,yelp-111,"First impression of the place: walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights. No one at the reception desk to greet you, no where to really sit. Once inside, there is a long hallway with doors on either side. Mostly they are offices. The only other option is a few benches that line the walls. I sat on one, thinking maybe this would be my spot to wait, but it was too bright. I wondered what was in the offices. There was a lot of space for people to work, but I wasn't sure if it was a rented out space, or a psychologists office. The only thing I could gather was that someone's name was ""Joy."" Maybe she was a psychologist. After a few minutes, I realized I was sitting in the office of the receptionist. She had simply stepped away. I moved to a bench, and a man followed. He was waiting for his girlfriend. He didn't seem like he had any idea where he was either. I was beginning to think this was a weird place, where people got lost and just stood around waiting for something to happen. When the man's girlfriend came out, he said to her ""I don't know where we are."" She laughed and said ""I know, I don't know where we are either. I think it's down there."" She pointed. ""But I'm not sure."" She started walking down the hallway, then stopped and said ""Oh, it's this way."" I followed them, until I realized they were just wandering around. Then I stopped and sat down on another bench. There were two women nearby talking in a weird kind of code. I couldn't make out what they were saying. I wondered if they were psychologists talking about their patients, or if they were patients talking about their psychologists. I needed to find a restroom, and I was beginning to get frustrated. I asked the receptionist, but she said they didn't have a restroom. I had to go back outside, walk down the block, and go into a bar. I walked back, feeling weird about the entire experience. I was beginning to feel like I was on some sort of odd, psychological journey. I've never had an experience like this before. I'm not a psychologist, but I'm starting to wonder if the entire point of the place is to give people an experience that makes them question what is normal. It is a place where things are confusing and weird, and you feel like you are the only one who doesn't know what is going on. I feel like it's a place that is supposed to make you feel anxious, and then you're supposed to talk about it with your therapist. Or maybe it's a place where people who feel anxious all the time come to feel at home. Previous post: Why don't people understand what I do?"

Dr. Pendleton handled all aspects of our insurance and it seemed like we were never without care!! We are going back yearly now!!! I feel that I have been given excellent advice by both Doctors. They responded quickly when needed and always made sure there were options available to discuss my concernsneeds. Thank You Everyone here has made this experience simple and convenient! The location was easy to find. I highly recommend this facility!! This clinic continues to impress me every time I've come here for help. Not only do the staff members make patient visits fun (my husband goes through tough periods) but also the commitment they've shown to providing quality services and support during these challenging times right along side us. We received favorable feedback from everyone who visited us today regarding their experiences yesterday. All of them said that we gave an outstanding presentation of Quit Smoking Services. You guys rock!!!! We had a great day..and yes tomorrow will be another wonderful program full of QUIT and LIFE! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT! I've met several people whose lives changed because of what we've done together - It's amazing to know we're supporting hundreds of heroic men women everyday doing the same thing....AND WE DO IT WITH FUN! Love you guys! Always go above and beyond to help patients get healthy or to continue making changes once they're ready to quit. Thank you again for everything! It was such a positive afternoon today and hopefully we'll be able to meet up soon enough to celebrate our successes! Great job coming out this morning and presenting our Quit Smoke Service programs!

Once inside, I was asked if they could get me any information about my appointment as it had been rescheduled!? Okay then... After being put on hold for 15 minutes and talking in circles over who would be able fix this mess (I am sure there is some sort error), we were told that since yesterday evening when she called them back from her vacationing trip -the doctor's secretary left without sending out an email letting everyone know not too come today; so due do other plans made already by all those individuals cancelations-that therefore everything must wait until tomorrow morning after 10am or before 7pm only which isn't even enough time because people need their medications throughout these hours!!

Once inside, the massage areas were dark, cool and clean which was a relief and the massage I received was good but its still an odd place. I added a body scrub to my massage service and strangely enough, there was no shower to rinse off afterwards. Body scrubs should be done in a wet room, not a dry massage room. So I left feeling little bits of scrub on me and sticky for the rest of the day."
OpenAI,yelp-111,"First impression of the place: walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights. No one at the reception desk to greet you, no where to really sit. Once inside, you notice that the waiting room is quite small and cramped, with only a few chairs available for patients to sit on. The walls are painted in a dull beige color, giving the space a drab and uninviting feel. The lighting is also too bright and harsh, making it uncomfortable to sit for too long. As you look around, you notice that there are no magazines or reading materials available for patients, which can make the wait feel even longer. The lack of a receptionist to greet you also adds to the impersonal and unwelcoming atmosphere. Despite these initial observations, however, you remain optimistic that the quality of care provided by the doctors and staff will be excellent."

I sat down and waited for about 30 minutes before my name was called. When I went back to the room, the doctor was very unprofessional. He didn't listen to my concerns and just told me what to do. I left the office feeling very unsatisfied and like I didn't get the help I needed."

If you like beer, you should like beer that is in pitchers. The bar's name. If it's a trendy, cool, sophisticated bar, it should have a name that reflects that. This bar's name is 'Raging Bull'. A bar called 'Raging Bull' is not a bar for people who like beer. Plenty of bars have names that are cool, trendy, sophisticated, and include the word 'beer' in them. This bar's name is not cool, trendy, sophisticated, or even that descriptive of the place. My suggestion would be to find a better name. The decor. This is what you see when you walk in. I've seen a lot of bars with different kinds of decor, but this one is not the most creative. I like the red and white color scheme, but I would have preferred a little more black. If you have a large crowd of people who are young, hip, and dressed up, you probably shouldn't have a place like this in your bar. If you have a large crowd of people who are dressed in old-fashioned clothing, you probably shouldn't have a place like this in your bar. The ""100 New England"" theme. 100 New England? Really?

BigScience,yelp-113,"Without the fun mariachi band, this place would have gotten one star. While we were seated right away, we didn't get a server for at least twenty minutes. Even tough they had everything on their menu here (lettuce wraps with all kinds of fillings - tuna, smoked salmon and chicken), I think that was just to quiet us down after our long wait. The drink menu is pretty extensive; only too bad it wasn't as well organized as the food menus which left me indecisive about what to order or not since there are so many things available! However, my husband decided to go up front because he really liked a cocktail called Sombrero. It came in two flavors: strawberrylemonade habanero cactus soda mix. (Habanano cactus has no alcohol content). The Sombrero itself tasted okay but i thought the lemon juicejuice from the fruit was overpowering. That might be personal preference though! This burger was very good indeed! The patty was thick cut, juicy but overall flavorful. My husband loved how much bacon was used in filling his burger while I preferred the grilled cheese version instead. I ordered them both thinking they'd taste similar, however, these turned out to be quite different. The Torta de Queso Salada did come close to being like quesadilla with its crisp exterior yet soft inside. I'd say it's better than the tortilla chips you usually find at fast-food places where you'd end up eating more calories then needed by having too few nutrients within the tortillas themselves (because they're loaded full of sugar!). However, if you're looking for an easy way to kill time waiting around during your visit, choose the handheld Quesito's instead! This breaded snack comes filled with steak bits and lettuce. Aside from giving your digestive tract some exercise, you'll also see yourself getting lots of protein into your body without feeling greedy later (like when ordering regular meals). After trying several drinks from their selection list including rum punch and margarita shakes, I enjoyed a simple scotch egg made freshly every morning. The eggs weren't cooked enough so they ended up hard to chew but still yummy nonetheless. I'm sure why people who live abroad can't seem to stop enjoying Scotch Eggs! We visited Yelp Local Trader Joe's first before deciding whether we'll return to buy groceries again. We found this location convenient especially given it's proximity to our home. Our favorite thing about Trader Joes' was definitely their wide variety of healthy options such as organic veggies, whole grain products, frozen fruits and desserts. It took longer than expected - 30-45 min - to receive our laundry service.

The table next to us sent back their fries because they were undercooked, so maybe we got theirs? My boyfriend liked his tacos, but I found them underwhelming. The fish taco didn't have much fish on it. The tacos were served on hard shells, which we were not expecting at all. The drinks were very good, but they were definitely lacking in alcohol. The sangria had about three pieces of fruit and was mostly juice. I was very disappointed by the price of drinks.

When a quesadilla is on the menu for 8, it's typically enough for a meal. The quesadilla was one corn tortilla with some cheese and like three pieces of meat. It was so small that it made the price offensive and it wasn't even that good! To add to such a bad experience, three of the five people ended up with stomach aches.

PaLM,yelp-114,"Let me start by saying that having come from the San Francisco Bay Area, I'm spoiled by all the awesome choices for food and services. But being new to Phoenix, it's been a learning experience. One thing I've noticed is that the food here is a lot more meat-centric than what I'm used to. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do like to have a variety of options, and it can be hard to find a good vegetarian meal in Phoenix. There are a few vegan and vegetarian restaurants, but they're few and far between. Another thing I've noticed is that the service here is a lot more relaxed than what I'm used to. In the Bay Area, people are always in a hurry and they expect you to be too. But in Phoenix, people are more laid-back and they're not as concerned with time. This can be a nice change of pace, but it can also be a little frustrating if you're used to things being done quickly. Overall, I'm still getting used to life in Phoenix.

Additionally, there are many online review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor that provide user-generated reviews of restaurants, stores, and services in the Phoenix area.

LLAMA,yelp-114,"Let me start by saying that having come from the San Francisco Bay Area...I'm spoiled by all the awesome choices for food and services. But being new to Phoenix, it's been a lot of fun checking out the local businesses that are here in the Valley of the Sun. So, you're probably wondering what's the deal with the title of this blog. Well, as a new resident, I'm always on the lookout for cool stuff to do and places to go, especially when it comes to services that are affordable and I can find a good deal. I was looking for a place to get my hair done and stumbled upon a website called Groupon. It's really an awesome site where you can find deals on things to do, places to eat, services to use, etc. It's a great way to get introduced to a new business or service as well. The deals are usually 50 off or more and in most cases there is a limit to how many you can buy so be sure to move fast if you see something that you're interested in. I'm pretty sure Groupon has been around for awhile now, but this was the first time I heard about it. I've been using the site for about a month now and already have purchased a few things. So far I've bought a coupon for an oil change, a discount on tickets to the Arizona State Fair, and I found a really good deal on getting my hair cut and colored. I purchased the hair coupon from a salon in Scottsdale and had an appointment yesterday for a consultation. The stylist was very nice and did a great job with my hair. She was really friendly and I felt totally comfortable there. I actually asked her if I could come back to have it colored because I was happy with the results. She said I could and that she'd give me the same discount. She also gave me some ideas for the next time I get it cut. I'm pretty excited about this new discovery and I'm already looking at the new deals that have been posted. In the last month I've bought a few things and have already saved over 100! That's a lot of savings for me. I'm going to be doing a lot more shopping here. As I've always said, who doesn't like to save money? Thank you so much for the kind words. We are glad you had a good experience at our salon and thank you for trusting us to take care of you. We look forward to seeing you again. Savvy Salon Kristi, this was a nice post and I am glad you had a good experience with the savvy salon. I have lived in AZ for about 20 years and I am still amazed at the number of businesses that do not fully understand the power of the internet. The Salon owner is obviously a savvy business owner. Posted by Mark and Tracey DeGraff, Phoenix AZ Home Team (HomeSmart Realty West) over 7 years ago Hi Mark and Tracey - Thank you so much! I agree, the salon owner was very nice and she was good at what she did. The salon was very cool and I had a good experience there. Kristi, you can buy gift certificates at half price or better on Restaurants.com. I used to have a great relationship with the owner of a fancy restaurant in Sacramento. She would purchase 25.00 gift certificates for 10.00 each. She would give them to customers who ordered appetizers and then had to leave early. They were a much better deal than giving away a free bottle of wine or dessert. Posted by Robert Hawks, Your Bay Area Real Estate Expert (Bay Area Realty Services) over 7 years ago Robert - I will have to check out restaurants.com. That's a great idea on what the restaurant owner was doing with the gift certificates. A very good idea."

Can not wait for new owners to bring their own flare in to make it even better. The service from Alicia was very friendly, clean professional. I had an excellent meal with my wife on Valentine's Day- barbecue steak salad (very well portioned), chicken tacos, soft shell crab flakes todo shells and grilled shrimp. The main course was comprised of rib eye beef, medium rare and cooked perfectly; fresh salsa verde, corn chips and sour cream added spice and texture without overwhelming any flavor. They did a wonderful job mixing up all the dishes using vegetables that complement each dish at hand.I have been a frequent diner since opening years ago. Never disappointed! Very nice warm welcome by ownerowner's family and helpful staff. Food was delicious, loved the cactus tortilla soup. Highly recommend I must say...this has become one of my favorite places to dine out during Covid restrictions. A big shout-out to Alfredo who always does such incredible work!!!

BigScience,yelp-117,"We have moved around the country a bit recently, and have found ourselves utilizing Yelp reviews pretty frequently to find the good local places when we move to a new area. It is so easy for us to just use Google Maps or TripAdvisor, but when you search through restaurants that are on those sites it doesn't always include all the cool little quirky things about them! We used to check out Eater New York City as well, but that's not really an option anymore. It's kind of like going back in time - I love this one (I'll share more later): When we were living in Pennsylvania one place was always high up on my list whenever I'd ask people ""Where should we eat tonight?...""and then other times I've wanted to go somewhere different. This sort of thing happened quite regularly until I began to notice they'd most likely say ""Oh no....we've been there before.."" And after over two years of this happening at every single dinner date I decided to start paying attention to what others had said about where we would be eating next! And here are some real life examples from our recent travels...these aren't necessarily negativepositive because it's how I see these things:) This restaurant has a very unique decor- reminiscent of old diners with foot stools, wicker tables and antique chairs. They also serve delicious food since I've eaten their burgers several times already and can't wait to try more. The service however can sometimes feel sluggish though... The walls are covered in artwork murals inspired by famous movies such as Pulp Fiction and Blade Runner. (They're even selling t-shirts!) Their menu mostly features seafood dishes which I'm sure will be amazing too, but their decor alone makes me want to come in right away! Often referred to as ""the world's best coffee shop"" and ""the oldest cafe open to public still serving breakfast..""this cafe offers a wide variety of pastries including macarons, croissants, French toast and waffles along with great looking coffee drinks. You may recognize some names on the staff who worked at Dunkin Donuts, Best Buy, Red Lobster etc., but if you're looking for something fun you need to visit this place! I wish I could make this post look fuller than it actually is-there are SO many wonderful eats in NYC!! But being realistic - -we only ate on the weekends at home during COVID restrictions, and now that everything is opening again I'm happy to tell y'all that I'm planning another trip soon! My mom once told me that she wouldn't consider moving anywhere else without pizza right? So yes, I definitely plan on returning whenever possible!! I'm almost certain I don't remember the last time we moved into a neighborhood where we didn't grow vegetables at least part-time! There are tons of ways growing your own veggies allows you control over exactly what goes in your body 24-7 and provides plenty of nutrients to help keep you healthy. Here are five reasons why having a garden is important during COVID-19 and beyond!"
LLAMA,yelp-117,"We have moved around the country a bit recently, and have found ourselves utilizing Yelp reviews pretty frequently to find the good local places when we move to a new city. We are now in the process of moving to a new city, and I am trying to decide how many Yelp reviews I want to write for the new place. In theory, I want to share the reviews of the places we've enjoyed with others. In practice, it takes some time to write a good review (and they are not all going to be five stars) so I'm thinking about just writing up one or two. On a related note, my husband and I both use Yelp but only one of us writes reviews. Should we both write reviews for a given business, or just have one of us do it? I'm guessing that the more reviews you have, the more trustworthy you are as a reviewer, but I'm not sure if that's actually the case. posted by phoenixy to Computers Internet (13 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite Yelp reviews are sorted by how trustworthy Yelp thinks you are, and they give you more credibility if you review more things. So, I say do it! Review the shit out of stuff, and don't worry about giving five stars to everything. posted by phunniemee at 5:39 PM on May 13, 2015 [1 favorite] I'm not sure if this is a universal rule, but yelp is set up to put the reviews by ""elite"" reviewers (50 reviews or something like that) at the top of the list, so I would assume that writing more reviews would help. posted by cakelite at 5:48 PM on May 13, 2015 It makes sense that the more reviews you write, the more trustworthy you would be. I write a lot of reviews, not because I'm trying to be trustworthy, but because I find the writing process itself helpful in thinking about how I feel about a place. I think it's fine to have both you and your husband write reviews for a given business. We often go out to dinner with friends and we all write different reviews about the same place. We see the same things, but we notice different details. posted by ralan at 5:54 PM on May 13, 2015 I have about 200 reviews and have received a lot of favorites for some of them. I think it really depends on the reviewer, not the number of reviews. If the reviews are detailed and well written, you can tell that they know what they're talking about and can trust their opinion. I've seen some people with a lot of reviews who I always skip over because their reviews are boring, vague, and short. posted by radioamy at 5:57 PM on May 13, 2015 I am pretty well known in my smallish town as a yelper. I've got a couple hundred reviews. My reviews are read as much for the writing as for the content. I've also written a couple of articles for the Yelp blog. I'm now ""Elite"" and get invited to Elite-only events. I've been given some very nice perks and freebies at events and restaurants. I'm not sure how much is my writing style and how much is my actual reviews, though. I'd say that if you like writing, give it a shot. If it's not your thing, you're not going to be happy doing it. posted by cooker girl at 6:17 PM on May 13, 2015 I've written about 300 reviews. I agree with cooker girl that it's more about the quality than the quantity, but the quality is definitely a function of the quantity. I've found I'm a better reviewer now than when I started, simply because the more you write, the better you get at it. I've also found that writing a review of a place I like is more helpful to me than one I don't like. I can be negative in the review, but there's a whole other layer of emotion going on when I'm writing about a place I don't like. As for whether you and your husband should each write reviews, I'd say definitely. I've seen some negative reviews on places that I really enjoyed, and the difference in our experiences might have been due to the fact that I'm with my"
Tsinghua,yelp-117,"We have moved around the country a bit recently, and have found ourselves utilizing Yelp reviews pretty frequently to find the good local places when we move to a new city. I have always been a little leery of Yelp reviews, and have had my reservations, but over the past couple years I have become more and more comfortable with them, and even have been using them as a source for finding a good place to eat, a new place to see, and even a place to go to the gym. The big difference for me, is that I do not rely on Yelp reviews to find the good places, I rely on them to help me decide if I want to go to the place, or if I am going to find it a waste of my time. The reviews on Yelp are the best way for me to see what the crowd likes, and if I like it, or not. I don't rely on them to get me to go, but I do rely on them to help me decide if I want to go.

If you want to see some of the best places in the city, or even the best place in your area, I think these tips will help you out a lot.

PaLM,yelp-117,"We have moved around the country a bit recently, and have found ourselves utilizing Yelp reviews pretty frequently to find the good local places when we move to a new city. We love the fact that we can read reviews from people who have actually been to the places we're considering visiting, and get a good idea of what to expect. One thing we've noticed is that the quality of Yelp reviews can vary significantly from city to city. In some cities, the reviews seem to be more honest and helpful, while in other cities, they seem to be more biased or misleading. We've also noticed that the quality of Yelp reviews can vary depending on the type of business. For example, we've found that the reviews for restaurants are generally more reliable than the reviews for other types of businesses, such as hotels or car dealerships. Overall, we think Yelp is a great resource for finding good local businesses. However, we recommend taking the reviews with a grain of salt, and doing your own research to make sure you're making a good decision. Here are a few tips for using Yelp effectively:  Read the reviews carefully. Pay attention to the tone of the reviews, and look for any red flags that might indicate that the reviewer is biased or unreliable.  Compare reviews from different sources. Don't just rely on Yelp reviews - read reviews from other websites and sources as well.  Do your own research. Even if the reviews are positive, it's still a good idea to do your own research to make sure you're making a good decision. By following these tips, you can use Yelp to find great local businesses that you're sure to enjoy. Here are some examples of good Yelp reviews:  ""We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience.""  ""This hotel was clean, comfortable, and affordable. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect. We would definitely stay here again.""  ""This car dealership was very helpful and efficient. They found me the perfect car at a great price, and they were able to get me into my new car quickly. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car."" Here are some examples of bad Yelp reviews:  ""This restaurant was a complete disaster. The food was terrible, the service was rude, and the atmosphere was dirty and uncomfortable. We would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.""  ""This hotel was a complete rip-off. The rooms were dirty and outdated, the service was terrible, and the location was in a bad neighborhood. We would never stay here again.""  ""This car dealership was a nightmare. They lied to us about the condition of the car, and they tried to rip us off on the price. We would never recommend this dealership to anyone."" By reading Yelp reviews carefully, you can avoid making bad decisions and find great local businesses that you're sure to enjoy."

That's great to hear! Yelp can be a great resource for finding local businesses and services. If you're looking for recommendations for restaurants, cafes, bars or other places to eat, you may also want to check out other food-focused apps such as TripAdvisor, Zomato, or OpenTable. They offer similar features to Yelp and may have different types of content that better suit your needs. Additionally, you can always ask locals for their recommendations and advice on the best spots in town - they often know the hidden gems that are less well-known to tourists or newcomers."

Human,yelp-117,"We have moved around the country a bit recently, and have found ourselves utilizing Yelp reviews pretty frequently to find the good local places when we move to a new area. Auto repair is one of those categories that you pretty much end up choosing between a bunch of places with 1-3 star reviews, and hoping for the best. So imagine my delight when we needed some work done shortly after moving to Charlotte and seeing a garage with ONLY 5 star reviews. Almost too good to be true, but it ended up being true for us. We took out SUV to Neighborhood garage needing new brakes, and hoping to figure out what was causing a troublesome vibration coming from the engine. I met Andy when I dropped the car off after hours and was immediately impressed with the level of attention and genuine interest he gave to the description I gave him. He actually stopped the work he was doing and got a piece of paper and pen to take down notes about my situation. The problem ended up being a pretty tough nut to crack. Luckily I was able to leave my car with Andy long enough for him and his team (working late on my car several times) to figure it out. We were EXTREMELY relieved to learn that the problem was a tricky but inexpensive motor mount. Andy had it fixed the next day, and only charged for the part for that portion of the work. In other words, he and several of his employees worked for several hours on several different day trying to diagnose the issue, and didn't charge a dime for any of it. Andy is extremely friendly, very responsive, and engaged when dealing with you. I find myself keeping a list of little nuisance issues I have been putting off having fixed just to be able to give Andy our work. I really can't overstate how happy we are to have found such a great place to go to for the type of stuff we've always dreaded until now. Andy and Neighborhood Garage will have our business and anyone else who asks us for as long as we live in Charlotte."

Great atmosphere, nice bar, small menu but lots of options, good atmosphere and a friendly staff. Would definitely go back. The pizza was fantastic. I would have loved more toppings. The service was friendly. It was a little loud, but that's a Phoenix thing. I think they're going to have to move out of the historic building. Too bad. The restaurant itself is pretty nice, but the food and service were not great. I would never return. This is one of the best pizzerias in Phoenix. It is old school, but updated. The owner is super friendly and the pizza is always hot and fresh. The staff is always very helpful. The desserts are also excellent. I recommend getting the tiramisu and the gelato for desert. It is a great place to grab a bite with friends. We got a seat in the dining room which was a nice place to have a quick bite to eat. The service was quick and they were able to bring us food while we were still waiting for our table. We had a little bit of a wait and they were able to bring us the food we ordered. I was very impressed with the service we received. We got to enjoy the patio while we ate. I would recommend the pizza and the chicken wings. We had a wonderful time at Cafe Du Nord.

Our room was beautifully decorated and upgraded, attention to detail was spot-on (did you know that I placed my order before arriving?). Front desk staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome upon arrival - they gave me a complimentary miniature drink cart when I asked which ended up containing two bottles of vodka!!! All other Hotel employees exuded professionalism and genuineness - as if every person working there knew who we were and what made us happy!! When it came time to go into the hotel restaurant, Bartender offered free drinks to each table while waiting until we ordered.

Tsinghua,yelp-120,"Pros: line moves faster than the other Buffet of Buffets lines we've been in Cons: the food is nothing special. We came for lunch and dinner since we stayed at the Hilton on 35th Street and had no problem getting in. I liked that there were stations where you could make your own food. We ordered a vegetarian sandwich and had it with a side of macaroni and cheese. It was really good. The service was really slow and not very friendly. I would not go back. Buffet of Buffets - St. John's Episcopal Church 291 E. 57th St. - St. John's Episcopal Church (East Village) Review by Kenneth We ordered our meals and took them to our seats. We had a table for 2, and 2 additional places to eat at, but they were not very large. There was only one staff person in the whole place, and it was just her and her husband. There was no way to place our food, so she took it to our table and we ate it there. There were very few people eating, so she was never really busy. There were a few people eating in the restaurant section, but I don't think there was a place to sit and eat there. She was nice, but she was really the only person there. We were very disappointed with the food. It was nothing special, and I think that was just because it was not very good. The price was very high for what you got. I would not recommend this place. Buffet of Buffets - Clinton Street 248 Clinton St. Review by Debra When we were looking for places to eat in the East Village, we saw the Buffet of Buffets ad in a restaurant guide. We had been to the Buffet of Buffets in Manhattan and had liked it. We thought we would give it a try again. We had 2 meals and they were both very good. The prices were high, but they were worth it. We had 2 meals for about 30, which was more than I had expected. The service was good. It was a good place to take a group of people. I would recommend it.

Tsinghua,yelp-123,"I've been a member for over 2 years now. At first, I loved the change from the usual local gym. The instructors were awesome! They were happy and amazing. However, after a year of working out there, I realized that I was just using the same machines over and over again. So I started to look for another gym. I'm not going to lie, I was a little hesitant about going to another gym. I'm a very strong believer in consistency. When I go to a new gym, I expect to be forced to work out in a different way. I was not prepared for the same old, same old! The worst part was that the classes were a bunch of people screaming at each other and no music. So I looked around and decided to try out a new gym. I decided to go to the South Beach Fitness. I knew the owner was a fitness guru. He had opened his first gym in Florida. So I decided to give it a try. I went in there for a free trial. It was like I was in heaven. They had all the machines that I was used to. The classes were so much better! They were not loud and you could hear the music. They also had a huge variety of classes. So I decided to sign up for a 3 month membership. I can't say enough about the owner of the gym. He's a genius. He is very creative. He made sure that the gym had everything that I needed. I'm so glad I found this gym! It is my favorite place to workout! Also, it is so convenient to me! I live in the area and I don't have to drive anywhere. I just walk 15 minutes to get to the gym. That is great! I'm a very lazy person, so this is a blessing! My sister lives close by as well and we love it. I am so glad that I found this gym. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

Don't waste your time believing everything someone tells you, especially when it comes to car maintenance.

He didn't mention any warranty benefits or anything like that so I'm not sure why you feel obliged to buy this stuff from him. Just tell him no when he's asking Good point. It's rare for a car owner in these parts to ever have their engine overhauled but it's never far off my mind when someone asks ""wouldn't my next oil change be better than just regular""? These guys are great people who really care but it's hard to avoid getting sucked into trying to push products whose primary purpose is to make money, especially since they're all too happy to offer something without thinking through how much impact they'll have on customer satisfaction levels."

So my fiance and I had dinner at the Big Bowl yesterday and we both really enjoyed it. I thought the service was a bit slow but overall I really enjoyed it. The pork belly was a little salty but I like it that way. I also really liked the lamb belly. The chicken was pretty good and it was big and juicy. I think it was the most expensive meal I have ever had at a restaurant and I would definitely go back. The other dishes were good as well. I went to the Big Bowl yesterday with my girlfriend. She's never been to a Korean BBQ restaurant and was very curious about what to expect. I tried to find a review online, but it wasn't easy. So I made my own. The staff was friendly and we were able to get in right away. We sat down and the waiter brought us some samples. I thought they were pretty good. I was a little worried about the price, but the portions were pretty big. I ordered the pork belly and the beef brisket. The pork belly was really good. It was so tender and juicy. The meat was so flavorful. It was a little salty but that was okay. I didn't really care for the sauce that they gave us. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed the beef brisket. I usually don't like beef brisket, but this was so good. It was really juicy and tender. I was a little worried about the sauce, but it was okay. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. I would definitely go back. The Big Bowl is a very good place for lunch. They offer different options for lunch. We usually go for lunch because they have Korean BBQ lunch specials. There are usually some pretty good deals on the menu. The food is really good. I like the taste of the food here. It's very different than most other places.

The pork tenderlion that was higly recommended by yelpers relied too much on the sauce (which was too sweet), once the sauce was gone, I had no desire to keep eating the meat. The fries was also way too thick, not crispy and too much oil. The gourmet burger was good, but no special. The best thing we ordered was the brussels sprouts. The mint, onions and walnuts made it super tasty. Overall, I wouldn't say it's a must go to place, unless you live nearby. I went here with a friend and we had a great time. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. We had the chicken parm sandwich and it was fantastic. The meat was juicy and tender and the bread was perfectly crisp. My only complaint is that the lemon aioli sauce on the side was extremely salty and overpowered the rest of the sandwich. My friend also had the chicken and waffles and it was also delicious. The chicken was perfectly crisp and the waffles were perfectly cooked. The maple syrup added a delicious sweetness and the spicy honey added a kick. I will definitely be coming here again to try their other delicious food. For a moment I thought I was in the South. I had the fried chicken and waffle with spicy honey. The chicken was juicy and crispy. The waffle was fluffy and crispy. The place was packed and the crowd was a good mix of young professionals and families. The staff were all helpful and very friendly. I went with a friend for brunch on Sunday and we both enjoyed it. I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and my friend had the shrimp and grits.

(If only i'd gone back home earlier!) The smell has not been properly addressed yet. This is clearly unacceptable behaviour by the ownermanagement team! The best restaurant I've eaten in years!!!! They have several different types of meat kebabs which are soooo good!! Can't wait until they're open again!! This wine seems to be raising its profile recently but deserves full attention: Gioia Nero di Montalcino Brunello Riserva 2016. It features red cherry fruit flavors, licorice and spices, with some earthy herbal notes too. The tannins are nicely integrated though soft; no harsh edges or acidity here. Drink now-2036. Italian wines often seem slightly disappointing when compared to those made elsewhere - Beaujolais Nouveau aside - even among the most renowned Italian regions. For example, Chianti Classico zone produces wines with much better rapport than Barolo (and less expense). Yet Tignanello 2015 has more depth and interest than Sangiovese ever can muster within similar price brackets. Made entirely from 100 Merlot grapes grown some 25 km south-east of Florence, this oenologically brilliant Tuscan red displays many distinct characteristics - particularly fine structure and concentration - without detracting from any notable charm. Bright sangria-red color. Aromas give way first to dark cherries, plums, cassis, black olives, minerals and violets, then gradually reveal hints of vanilla, cloves, black pepper and cigar box before finishing delicately savory. A serious expression of terroir-driven Merlot. Medium bodied, well-balanced and silky-smooth still evident through the long finish. Drink 2016-2025 Palo Cortona Rosso 2011 shows aromas of strawberries, raspberry jam, dried herbs, green peas and mint. Its bright yellow-purple-colored body reveals sweet grapefruit-like notes and fresh berry fruits. There's also a touch of earthiness and forest scents along with hint of toast. Dry acidity enhances fruit intensity. Palato La Bianchetta 2009 expresses currants, blueberries and delicate oak characters. It's medium-bodied with nice balance between acids and alcohol. Opulent mouthfeel offers a candy-coated palate enriched with ripe berries, candied citrus rinds and minty nuances. Fine grain shimmers off glass. Terrific overall quality for this winemaker-overlooked area. Pair with heart-shaped pasta dishes such as calzones and ravioli. Enjoy forthrightly during summer months. Tuscany is probably Italy's largest producer of high-end table wine despite being a comparatively small region (only 2 of total European vineyard surface), thanks largely to fertile soil conditions where rich volcanic soils predominate. And typically, these lend themselves splendidly to high-quality sparkling rose production. Not bad considering it's produced under extreme temperature fluctuations both day and night throughout-the-year...like anywhere else in Europe."

I was a little disappointed with the food. My son had a cheeseburger and it was well done. He said it was over cooked. I had the pork chop and it was well done. It was not rare. I am not sure how much more I can expect to pay for the meat. We ordered fries with our meal and they were not hot. They were cold and my son could not eat them. I was not happy with the service either. The waiter took forever to come back to our table and he was very rude. He said it was not my fault. I told him it was his fault for not coming back. He told me to relax. I have never been treated like that before. The food was ok. It was not good but not bad. I will go back. I went to Isabekka's on Saturday night. The food was great, the service was very good. The staff was very attentive and the food was hot and well-prepared. The only negative aspect of the experience was the long wait. The restaurant was very crowded and the wait for a table was around 30 minutes. The good news was that I got a nice table, close to the window, which was a big plus.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-127,"So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip, which is probably what most people would do. I stayed at The Orleans Hotel (just off of Las Vagas Blvd) for 30night including parking!!!!! It's... umm.. old school? Not by any means fancy but certainly funky! Like almost everything else out there except New York City or San Francisco - places are ""famous"" because they're famous not necessarily good haha Anyway two words: CRAZY FUNKY HOTELS!!!! And this one has some cool memories from last year:). So yeah if you want an inexpensive place with character go here:) They even gave me free shampoo conditioner despite all their other stuff being overpriced so wootwoot 3 Also check them oops oh right no charge also okay don'y worry too much lol"

I will post pics when we get back home... but here are some shots at the beginning, which shows what kind of ""event"" we were there for: By all means visit and enjoy your trip!!! We love to hear about it!! Thank you so much again for sharing with us!! This turned out well! It looks like fun (and so does Florida)!

My friend actually had a wedding that weekend and it was a great trip. 1. Bellagio: The fountains are absolutely beautiful and it is a must see. 2. Caesars Palace: It was a very nice hotel. 3. The Venetian Hotel: It was amazing and so realistic. 4. The Strip: It was so bright and colorful at night. 5. The Paris Hotel: It was another nice hotel.
OpenAI,yelp-127,"So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip the entire time. That's great to hear! Vegas definitely has a lot to offer beyond the strip, including outdoor activities like hiking, beautiful national parks like Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam, and great food and entertainment in neighborhoods like downtown and Chinatown. It's always good to try new things and explore different areas when traveling to new places."
PaLM,yelp-127,So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip. I actually stayed in a hotel about 30-40 mins from the strip. It was a lot cheaper and I found it to be more enjoyable! There was a free shuttle that took us to and from the strip and I had no problems with it. I also found that the casinos were not as crowded as the ones on the strip and I was able to get a lot more gambling done. I would definitely recommend staying off the strip if you are looking for a more affordable and enjoyable trip to Vegas.
Tsinghua,yelp-127,"So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the Strip for more than a day or two! I took a few days off to just relax and go see my parents. I also got to see my boyfriend of two years- Matt- he was in town for a few days. I am so glad we were able to get away from work for a little bit and enjoy some time together! The wedding was amazing and I loved my dress.... and my sister's dress was beautiful too! We are so excited for them and can't wait to see pictures. They are so cute together! I have always wanted to see the Taj Mahal, so I was so excited when we went there! It was really beautiful.... although I would have liked it to be lit up at night. My mom and sister had so much fun playing the slot machines and my mom won 30 bucks! She is such a hoot! I loved the show and the food was good too. We went to dinner at a great place called Vino by Scott on the Strip and it was delicious! After the wedding we went to dinner at Panchos in the MGM Grand. It was really good and the churros were to die for! On our way home we stopped at Las Vegas Ice Works. It was so fun and we got some ice cream and a smoothie! The wedding was wonderful and the venue was beautiful. I was so excited to have a big family and close friends get together for such an important day. It was nice to spend time with my mom and sister and see my brother and his girlfriend. It was a wonderful day and I am so glad I was able to spend it with my family and my boyfriend. My mother is the best.... always looking out for me and making sure I have what I need! So my mom and I went to Disneyland and I had such a great time! We went to the parks on Saturday and Sunday and it was so much fun! I went to Disney World with my family in the summer and it was so much fun, but Disneyland is so much better! We rode the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, had a ride on the monorail, went to Space Mountain, got a cupcake at Mickeys Candy Cane Lane, and saw the Christmas lights. We also went to the Ice Rink and saw the princesses! My mom bought me a really cute tutu from Disney and it was so fun to wear. We also saw the show ""Frozen"" and it was so good! I loved it! I am so excited for my trip to California next month! My mom and I went to San Diego and had a blast! It was so much fun! We got to see all the sights and go to some really great restaurants! We ate at All-Clad, Carne Asada, and Terrazzo. All-Clad was the best and the food was so good! I love Mexican food and I have always wanted to try it. It was so good! We also ate at Terrazzo which was really good and my mom and I went to Carne Asada and had a really good time! My mom and I went to the beach and took a few days to just relax and go shopping. We went to a little town called La Jolla and had a great time! I had a great time in San Diego and I can't wait to go back! My mom and I went to the beach and got to see some of the sights of San Diego. We went to the ocean, saw the old train cars and took some great pictures. I got to see the local surfing spots and was so excited to see the waves! I loved the beach and I can't wait to go back! My mom and I also got to see the town of La Jolla which is really cute. I loved walking around and getting to see the local shops. I loved the hot dogs and we also got to eat at the local ice cream shop. I loved everything about San Diego and I can't wait to go back! I got to spend time with my family this weekend and it was so much fun! My mom and I went to the beach and took a few days to relax. We ate at a great restaurant called Mr. Charlie's and I got to try some really good food! We also went to a great coffee shop called Brewed Awakenings and it was so good! I loved the hot chocolate and coffee! My mom and I also went to see ""Zootopia"" and it was so good! I love animals and this movie was so good. It was about a bear, a fox, a rabbit, and a zebra who are trying to save their city and save their friends. The movie was so good and I loved it!"
Human,yelp-127,So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip. The staff is great and we were greeted with a smile and 2 warm cookies! There is a shuttle that runs to the MGM every hour- so that was quite helpful! Saved me and the BF about 60 in taxi fares. It'll run about 20 from the strip back to the D.T. They have an applebee's on site- pretty cool.... especially when you don't want to pay to go anywhere.... Although they did have a cafe in the lobby..... I didn't get a chance to check it out. Anywho- they have a nice workout room and small pool..... for the price and convienence- not bad at all!

This place was no exception, the chef was very friendly and kept the conversation going throughout the meal. The food was also delicious, I especially enjoyed the shrimp and beef dishes. The service was excellent, the staff were attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to others.

Human,yelp-128,"Had dinner here the other night for my birthday. I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air. So we decided to try Benihana's. Unfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke. His performance was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat! The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty. You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold. They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats. They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls. They also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out. This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for."

This restaurant however is not very busy, which after all makes sense since you're basically right next door from where they make their food at this place too... but still that doesn't hurt business in any way or form!! hahaha My friends family enjoyed themselves quite well though:) The fish sukiyake soup tasted really fresh (just like how i remembered!) although we didn't order anything else because of our friend who ordered sashimi later on - she got her favorite sea bream with spicy ginger sauce!!! It looked delicious We also ended up ordering ChineseKorean style fried rice when one person couldn' t eat what everyone wanted anymore... wasn'tt bad either:DBut definitely love me some Korean BBQ chicken katsu plate The portions were generous enough except maybe if u happen 2 get certain dishes.. anyway thats just personal preference shrugsI would say try out Bamboozle its worth every penny"

This place was a bit different. The chef didn't tell any jokes. In fact, he was a bit of a grump. He did not acknowledge any of the customers until it was time to cook their meal. The food, though, was very good. My steak was cooked perfectly, and the shrimp was very good too. I ordered the chicken fried rice, which was excellent. The prices were about what you would expect for a Japanese steakhouse, maybe a little less expensive. It's located in the old Golden China building on Fruitville Rd. It's not an overly fancy restaurant, but it is clean and the service was good. If you like teppanyaki, this is a good place to go. The prices are reasonable and the food is very good. We ate here on 10315, I had the New York Strip Steak and my wife had the Chicken Breast. The food was delicious! I also had a sake martini, and a Sapporo beer. I love the beer chilled with an ice ball. I would highly recommend this restaurant! The staff was very friendly and the chef was entertaining. The prices were reasonable."
BigScience,yelp-128,"Had dinner here the other night for my birthday. I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was making food, but this one was different just from how not friendly they were with everyone ordering their meal at random without asking if you needed anything special or what! Not that it mattered much since everything came out fine, but I felt so bad about having such an experience there! This place is very nice inside as well outside because of its outdoor space. My favorite restaurant in Singapore. After visiting many Japanese Restaurants all over Asia, we finally got lucky enough to visit Katsuya. There are two branches on Somerset Road (1) Tanjong Pagar respectively. (2) Katsuya has become quite famous amongst Asian tourists especially among those who love sushi andor seafood. It offers amazing variety of delicious dishes which includes Sushi, Sashimi, Fried foods and desserts. We ordered some basic starter like California Maki Roll Crispy Chicken Salad Sandwich which both tasted great. Upon finishing our main courses, we decided to order dessert after seeing the huge selection available. The Apple Tart should be top 1 most popular item! OMG, it was soft yet crunchy wrapper combination of pastry tart filling. Such a delightful treat indeed!!! For side dish, we chose Shrimp Tempura Fries which we shared between 2 people thank goodness... Delicious!!!"

This time I got a different chef who was less funny and did not tell jokes, he also seemed very lazy and was slow in doing his job. He made me wait for 30 minutes before he even started to cook my food. He also put in too much of the sauce and my food was too spicy for my taste. I don't think I'll be returning. The last time I was here I ordered the salmon and had a mixed vegetable plate and the service was good. This time I ordered the tuna and again the service was good, however the meal was much smaller than I expected and the salmon was not as fresh as I had previously ordered. I ordered the tuna and the salmon and was very disappointed in both of them. I was very disappointed in the quality of the salmon. The tuna was also a little bit off and was very rubbery. The bread was good but not very flavorful. The portions were small for the price of the meal."

The people at the next table were having a good time and were eating all of their food. There was quite a lot of people and the staff was very slow in clearing the tables. I did not feel that I was treated with any kind of respect. I would not go back to this place.

Very good food. The wait staff was very good and I did not feel rushed. I got a sweet and sour beef and it was very good. My husband got a filet mignon. He said it was good too. We also got a fried oyster dish and that was also good. The one thing that I did not like was that the service staff would not give us a drink until we ordered. We ordered and they brought the drinks but we did not get the drink for a while. It was a little annoying but it did not affect our meal.

LLAMA,yelp-130,"Wasn't too impressed with this place. I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio. All the tables were quite dirty! I went inside and asked for a wet rag and soap to clean the table. The hostess just looked at me like I had asked for a unicorn! Eventually she brought me some paper towels and a bottle of sanitizer. After sitting down, I realized that the chairs were all covered with dog hair. We were the only ones sitting outside so it wasn't like someones dog had been there before us. The menu was pretty standard pub fare. I went with the nachos and they were very greasy and average. The service was also pretty bad. The waitress was very rude. I would not recommend this place at all. Posted by DaveO on June 24, 2012 at 10:56 AM Re: ""Rusty Rudder"" Good sandwiches. Poor service. Posted by goodfoodonly on March 20, 2012 at 1:00 PM Re: ""Coleman Public House"" I have been to Coleman's Pub twice in the last month and have had a wonderful experience both times. The menu has a great selection of both small and large plates. I am a big fan of the small plate selection as it allows me to try several dishes. The Chicken Wings are to die for. My husband is a big burger fan and swears this is the best burger he has ever had. The Pub Fries are also excellent. Our server was friendly and attentive both times we were there. We look forward to returning again. Posted by CharlestonDining on February 6, 2012 at 12:41 PM Re: ""Tavern and Table"" I will admit, I was expecting a lot more from this place. I was excited to try it and even though I got reservations, I still had to wait 20 minutes for my table. I have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. The food was good, not excellent, but good. I liked the selection of the menu and the beer was cold. I think what surprised me was the lack of service. Both times I was there, I had to ask to have my beer refilled and to have the server take my order. I also had to ask for a to-go box on my second visit. I don't think this place will be around long if they don't improve their service. Posted by goodfoodonly on January 24, 2012 at 3:47 PM I have been here twice and had a very good experience each time. The service has been good and the menu has a nice variety of pub fare. I love the wings! I also enjoy the fact that they have entertainment most nights. It's nice to have a local place to grab a beer or a bite to eat. I think the burgers and the pizza are the best on the menu. The shepards pie was also good. I will definitely be going back again soon. Posted by CharlestonDining on January 24, 2012 at 1:24 PM Re: ""Fish"" We have been to Fish 3 times. The first two times were good. I thought the fries were a little soggy but the fish was very good. Our last visit was not good. We waited over an hour for our food. When we asked the server how much longer it would be she said the kitchen was very backed up and our food would be out in about 10 minutes. Our food finally came out and was just not very good. The fries were soggy and the fish was very greasy. I think they need to work on their consistency. I probably will not go back again. Posted by goodfoodonly on January 23, 2012 at 12:23 PM We were not impressed. The restaurant was not very clean. The food was ok but the service was terrible. We had a party of 5 and we had to ask for things throughout the whole meal. We had to ask for water and silverware and refills. Our server never checked back to see if we needed anything. Even when we saw her, she did not seem interested in helping us. The manager came over at one point to ask how things were and we told him. He just walked away. I would not go back here.

OpenAI,yelp-130,"Wasn't too impressed with this place. I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio. All the tables were quite dirty! I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience at the restaurant. It's unacceptable for the tables to be dirty especially during lunchtime. Have you considered letting the management know about the issue? They may not be aware of the problem and may appreciate the opportunity to address it. Additionally, if you feel comfortable doing so, you can leave a review of your experience online to provide feedback to others considering the restaurant."
Human,yelp-130,"Wasn't too impressed with this place. I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio. All the tables were quite dirty! I understand that we were seated outside, however, I have eaten at other restaurants before where their patio seating is CLEAN...I guess it doesn't happen at this place. Overlooking the dirtiness, I wanted to give Bootleggers an opportunity to prove my impression wrong through their food. As the waitress came out, I saw that her uniform (which was black) was quite dirty also! Her black apron and shirt was smeared with some red sauce (spaghetti maybe?) and white powder (cocaine maybe?)...Really not appetizing. I did notice that the inside dining had very dim lighting, so maybe she didn't realize that her uniform was that dirty. Nonetheless, it's not something I want to see. She took our drink orders and handed us the menus. Even those were DIRTY! A friend of mine had a coffee stain on his menu and we all had watersauce stains throughout the pages....They should really clean those! We should have left then and there, but NO! I wanted to let Bootleggers redeem themselves through their food. The waitress came back quickly with our drinks, complementary mini garlic rolls, and took our food order (she was quite friendly btw, which was a plus). I had the mozzarella caprese and deep fried cheese ravioli. The garlic rolls were not really warm...well, let me take that back. They were warm on the outside and cool on the inside. Meh, let's say I wasn't a fan. The mozzarella caprese and deep friend cheese ravioli were both were pretty good. Nothing exciting or exceptional though. The caprese needed more balsamic glaze. They just squiggled three lines on the plate. The cuts of mozzarella were nice and thick, so was the tomatoes. The deep fried cheese raviolis came with marinara sauce. There was a good crunch to them. However, once again, these dished were forgettable...which is better than being bad dishes, I guess. Overall, I don't think I will be returning. However, I did enjoy the weather:)"
PaLM,yelp-130,"Wasn't too impressed with this place. I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio. All the tables were quite dirty! We waited a while for our server to come and take our order, and when she finally did, she seemed very rushed and not very friendly. She took our order and then disappeared for a while, only to come back and tell us that they were out of one of the items we had ordered. We were a little disappointed, but we decided to just order something else. Our food finally came out, and it was pretty good, but not great. The service was still pretty bad, though. Our server never came back to check on us, and we had to flag her down to get our bill. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this place. The food was decent, but the service was terrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Here are some specific examples of the problems I encountered:  The tables were dirty.  The server was rushed and not very friendly.

BigScience,yelp-130,"Wasn't too impressed with this place. I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio. All the tables were quite dirty! The food was also mediocre, it didn't feel like we got what we ordered (too salty) or that they put in extra effort to make us happy. Amazing pizza. We haven't been back since our last visit but will be going again soon because they have amazing pizzas! Stayed there for 2 nights during my wedding weekend. This hotel is always clean when you arrive at any time of day night. Room service is great has an awesome breakfast. Staff are friendly and helpful. If you're looking for yoga classes you'll find them here...the only way I've ever missed one!! They offer multiple levels including beginners... I've never heard about him before I checked into Vegas, he said he'd pick me up from Hoover Dam so I could take pictures of ""Miss America."" He then brought his own camera along and took more than half as many photos as I did."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-130,"Wasn't too impressed with this place. I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio. All the tables were quite dirty! And they didn't do much to clean up after we left, so when my friend pulled her chair back in...we saw that it wasn' t just crumbs but also some dirt from their table onto hers as well (she was careful not put anything there). The food itself tasted ok; nothing special though... espescially compared against other places around town which are far better value (european restaurant next door is 2 bucks more per entree than here!)"
Human,yelp-131,"Just had a very memorable experience her this past weekend. We made a reservation and my boyfriend asked that since it was a date to make is special. When we arrived, they sat us right away at a round banquette that overlooked the entire restaurant from the back of the room. Perfect location. The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done. We went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. thinking we were jsut getting tastes of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The wine guy (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that I was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food I just went back to our hotel and zonked out!;-P For anyone looking for a memorable dining experience, there's lots of celebrity chef restaurants out there but this one was really worth it. The bill came out to about 300 for two with tip, I believe (i just glanced at it as he opened it) Not bad at all."

When we arrived, the staff had set up the table with candles, rose petals, and a personalized note wishing us a happy date night. Throughout the meal, the server checked in on us frequently, and recommended some of their most popular and delicious dishes. The ambiance was incredible, with soothing music playing in the background and a cozy atmosphere. We both had a wonderful time and it was definitely a date night to remember."

The salad was fresh and flavorful and the goat cheese was perfectly creamy. For our main course, we had the filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection and was incredibly juicy. The accompanying asparagus was also delicious. We ended the night with the chocolate mousse cake, which was light and fluffy and had a rich chocolate flavor.

BigScience,yelp-131,"Just had a very memorable experience her this past weekend. We made a reservation and my boyfriend asked that since it was a date to make is special. When we arrived they were so nice, friendly, helpful and welcomed us with open arms. My husband ordered the fish tacos as I wanted some seafood for dinner..Both meals are incredible! The food came out hot and delicious! Marina's has become our favorite restaurant in Redondo Beach....people come from all over town just to eat here! Been coming here for years but never been before because of Covid restrictions- but like everyone else have also missed cooking at home...so stopped by on Sunday night and not disappointed. Service was quick an efficient...The more you order the better your value gets!! They did mention delivery would be limited - I guess their employees don't get paid when people can't go visit them? But whatever, got what I needed will definitely continue returning. We started visiting marina's after moving to redmond beach about 10 or 12 yrs ago - always enjoyed the food. Our family grew up going there too I love eating here, it's great quality food with lots of options. The best part though isn't only does they serve amazing food which really speaks volumes considering how few restaurants exist around Redondo Beach now (which is sad), they're super welcoming and fun place to hangout with friends. Also affordable prices compared to other places. Marina's rocks!!! I've tried many times to write reviews but no one reads them!!! In fact if it says ""read"" it won't let me comment!!!! Ok ok let's try again. This is THE BEST FISH TACOS EVER!!! Oh my gosh, these things rocked!!! I'm not even joking!!! This guy makes his own salsa and offers multiple sauces to choose from. One of mine went off perfectly well with my Gatorade flavor drink. If you're looking for something fresh and DELICIOUS without breaking the bank then MARINA'S IS YOUR PLACE TO BE!!! Best mexican take-out ever! Food fantastic, service fast and reliable, dishes big enough for two adults! Delicious margaritas, great drinks selection, friendliness of staff!! I don't normally leave a review but this time I felt compelled due to the exceptional dining experience I've received during my most recent visits to Marina's Mexican Grill. First of all, thank you for supporting local businesses. Secondly thanks for providing safe work environments where health protocols can be observed while still enjoying outstanding cuisine developed by Executive Chef Paul Cederholm, whose passion for making excellent food comes through every bite. Following are some tips regarding a safe environment: - To ensure social distancing, please plan ahead reserving seating directly with Marina's. Reservations available 247 via phone call or text message chat. - All masks must be worn at all times inside the establishment - No drinking outside tables or chairs - Be considerate when ordering foods between couples as table side waiters may need assistance being seated and delivered food safely - Wash hands regularly using alcohol based sanitizer provided inside the establishments - Customers arriving together should remain separate from others when possible - Clean counters and surfaces frequently- any dirty items removed immediately - Hand disinfectant wipes placed strategically throughout the establishment For additional information please contact Marina's mexican grill at PI:KEY"
Tsinghua,yelp-131,"Just had a very memorable experience her this past weekend. We made a reservation and my boyfriend asked that since it was a date to make is special. When we arrived at the restaurant they asked if we wanted a table for two or 4. I said that we would like 4, as I had brought my parents and a friend to join us. We were seated and my boyfriend was given a special card and then my parents and I were given cards. We were asked if we wanted to see the menu. We said yes and the man that was there went away and came back with a menu for us. He then asked if we would like to see the wine list. We said yes and he asked if we wanted a drink and I said yes and he brought us drinks. When we were seated we had asked that the waiter bring us water, a beer, and a glass of wine. After we had all been seated, he brought us the menu. I ordered a bottle of red wine. After I had ordered, my parents and I were each given a glass of wine.

LLAMA,yelp-132,"The hubby and I arrived on Friday and went to Pure later that night with another couple. We had a lot of fun! It was even better that we didn't have to pay cover. On Saturday, we went to the market, had lunch at The Roast Room, stopped by Black's and then ended up at the city for some shopping. We had dinner with the family and then met up with another couple at The Keg for drinks and dessert. I know, we are such party animals! On Sunday, the hubby and I went to the casino for breakfast and then walked around the mall. Afterwards, we dropped by my dad's for lunch and then headed home."

It was even better that we didn't have to wait that long in line and we didn't have to pay a cover! The only thing that needs to be improved is the organization of the line. We were all bundled up in a ball line. The music was good, not a lot of hip hop music though. The decor is nice but I really enjoyed the rooftop. Wish we would have spent most of our time there."
PaLM,yelp-132,"The hubby and I arrived on Friday and went to Pure later that night with another couple. We had a lot of fun! It was even better that we didn't have to pay for anything because we won a free bottle of champagne at the door. We ended up staying there until the club closed at 4am. Then we went back to the hotel and got some rest. The next day, we went to the beach. It was beautiful out there! We spent the whole day laying out in the sun and swimming in the ocean. We had a great time and it was the perfect way to start our vacation."

OpenAI,yelp-132,The hubby and I arrived on Friday and went to Pure later that night with another couple. We had a lot of fun! It was even better that we didn't have to worry about transportation as we were able to use the Pure shuttle service. It sounds like you had a great time at Pure Nightclub! I'm so glad to hear that you didn't have to worry about getting around thanks to the shuttle service. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Tsinghua,yelp-132,"The hubby and I arrived on Friday and went to Pure later that night with another couple. We had a lot of fun! It was even better that we didn't have to wear swimsuits because the pool was only a few feet deep. So if you're ever looking for an intimate holiday to get away from it all, Pure is a great choice. Plus, the location was perfect for a quick weekend getaway to the Hamptons. We took the ferry over to the East End and were home in less than 3 hours. Now that the weather is getting nicer, we'll be looking for more opportunities to head to the Hamptons. Next time we'll be going to Greenport and taking the boat over to the Far Rockaway. We had a great time at Pure. The staff was very friendly and the vibe was great. We didn't do any yoga, but we did spin and had a blast! The exercise class that we attended was fun and challenging. We had the pleasure of meeting a lot of other people who were just as friendly and fun. I would highly recommend Pure Yoga to anyone looking for a great workout. The owners, Jonathan and Andrew, have created a place where people can get a great workout while being surrounded by friends. They are very friendly and always there to make sure that you're having a good time. I hope that you get the chance to visit Pure. It's a place that you can feel comfortable and relaxed. Wednesday, May 16, 2012 We had a great time at Pure. The owner, Jonathan, was very friendly and took the time to explain the different classes. I can see why so many people have been coming back for years. We went to the spin class and had a blast! It was challenging and the music was great. After the spin class, we did yoga. We got a lot of good exercise in. We are looking forward to our next trip to Pure. I can't wait to go to the spin class again. It was a fun workout and it was great to meet new people. Sunday, May 13, 2012 We went to Pure Yoga last night. It was great! The owner, Jonathan, was very friendly and knowledgeable. I can see why so many people are coming back. It was a great workout and we met a lot of new people. It's a great place to go if you're looking for a great workout. I hope that you get the chance to visit Pure. It's a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. Thursday, May 10, 2012 We are on vacation in South Carolina. I haven't posted anything for a while. We've been having a lot of fun and are enjoying every minute of it. Our vacation is coming to an end. We have a few more days to go, but we'll be heading back home soon. We've been to the beach, a amusement park, and a horse farm. We've been to Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head, and the Lowcountry. We've been eating great food, playing golf, and enjoying the great weather. We've been spending a lot of time with family and friends. It's been a wonderful vacation. We're going to miss the beach and the beautiful weather. We'll be looking forward to our next vacation. I hope that you are having a great week. We'll be back to regular posting on Monday. I hope that you have a wonderful weekend. Have a great week!

BigScience,yelp-132,"The hubby and I arrived on Friday and went to Pure later that night with another couple. We had a lot of fun! It was even better that we didn't have any wild animals in the area, but they were there mostly anyway. Saturday morning around 8:30 we headed out for some breakfast at Pokey's Diner (the pictures are below). Then about 10:00 we met up with one of my friends Julie who lives locally and her husband John; she drove us all over town visiting family buildings including Pioneer Village and Pottsville Trolley Museum. The museum is amazing...and it has good food too! For lunch, we took our own picnic by eating at Root Cabin Cafe right outside the entrance gate. Besides being a nice place to eat and enjoy beautiful scenery surrounding you, it's also free admission which makes things much more affordable than going inside other places!! We started driving back home from here after Lunch so we could stop by Purdy Gardens for periscope live seals before heading into Portland. Heading toward Oregon: After stopping off here we found ourselves near an old high school where my friend Sarah teaches art classes - they don't seem like students anymore as they start getting older! It's quite breathtaking however especially when looking through the glass doors - something I've never seen anywhere else. This gigantic structure looks almost surreal:"

Tsinghua,yelp-134,"Awesome food, awesome service. The best way to do teppanyaki without breaking the bank or having to drive down to the strip. We have been here many times for birthdays, family gatherings and just for fun. Portions are big, but the food is good and not overly salty. I recommend the chicken skewers, and the udon soup. Don't forget the shiitake mushrooms. Best place I've been to for teppenyaki. Will be back for sure. I've been here for dinner on several occasions. I've also had teppenyaki there on several occasions. My most recent visit was a teppenyaki. The teppenyaki is very good, and they have the largest teppenyaki I've seen in Vegas. The portions are generous, and the service is good. The place is very clean, and it's nice and quiet. There is a small bar on the side, but I would recommend going to a teppenyaki establishment if you want a drink. There are also some food items to purchase at the bar, but it is a very small selection. Overall, I would recommend this place for a teppenyaki. Great place. I love their beef, and their beef was the best I've ever had. The portions are large, and the service is great. It's nice and quiet, and it's close to the strip. They have a small bar, but it is only for food, not drinks. I've eaten here on several occasions, and I will be back. I have eaten here many times, and I have never had a bad meal. The portions are large, and the service is very good. The only reason I have not given this place a 5 star rating is because I have never been able to eat the shrimp. The shrimp are very good, but I'm allergic to shrimp. I can eat the beef, and the udon, but I cannot eat the shrimp. It's a small price to pay for the large portions and great service.

It comes out in individual serving bowls so you can get as much or little of each ingredient that way without feeling like your over-eating because there are only 2 servings to an order instead being able to overload yourself if it were 4 big plates...which would be ridiculously expensive.) The food was excellent (except for my wife's dessert which we found very dry) but what really made me smile about our experience at Mimosa Grille last night: When they brought us back from taking some photos outside by ourselves after finishing up eating drinking too late into Saturday evening around 1am - Mr C walked right past where his main table seats used t"
Human,yelp-135,"Wife and I had dinner on sat, April 30. I ordered the organic chicken with shrooms. This is a signature dish and she ordered the beef short rib dinner with Mac and cheese. Well the chicken was like med rare beef, pink and oozing pink juice. Not good. Sent back to kitchen and came back, kinda medium, still pink near the bone. Sent back again and manager came out and said what can we do, so I ordered the tuna which was good. Wife's short rib was not what I am used to for short ribs. No falling off the bone here. Just chunks of beef that was kinda dry and overcooked. Like brisket really. So not to good a first experience. As I tell everyone, if you want good chicken, check out Banderra in Scottsdale. They set the standard for all chicken in the valley. Sooo good."
LLAMA,yelp-135,"Wife and I had dinner on sat, April 30. I ordered the organic chicken with shrooms. This is a signature dish and she ordered the beef short rib dinner with the added asparagus. Both meals were very good and the wine prices are reasonable. The hostess seated us at a table that was too close to a group of young people (at least I'm assuming they were young due to the amount of volume and laughter emanating from their table) which made our dinner conversation difficult. I requested a move and it was done with no problem. They have a great salad bar and it's included in the price. There are also some items from the salad bar that you can order separately. The service was good, they were busy but it seemed like our waitress was on top of it. We will be back. Such a great place to get something to eat after a day of fun. We went up there to snowboard and decided to go grab a bite to eat. I ordered a taco and it was really good. We ended up ordering another one and it was just as good. The service was great and the workers were super nice. Fast and friendly service. Pizza was good and fresh. Beer is always cold. Tv's make it a great spot to watch the game and eat a slice of pizza. I was pleasantly surprised how good the pizza was. The chicken alfredo was delicious. Always a great experience. If you want good food, plenty of choices, and a great atmosphere this is the place. We came to this place with our son for his birthday. We had a great time and the food was great. We will be back. So we had a great time here. This is a really nice place with good food. The service was friendly and the prices were good. We stopped in here for a bite to eat after a long day of snowboarding. We came in around 7:30pm and it was pretty empty. We ordered a pizza and it was delicious. We also shared a beer. The service was quick and friendly. We will definitely be back. I had a great experience here. The service was really good.

The first course came around 2 minutes ago...no sir!! We got our food for 15 minutes later and guess what?? It took 3 times as long to come out! There were no swords nor knives in sight!!! When we finally got it, there wasn't any sauce or anything else at all on top! My wife then mentioned that they didn't bring her hot chocolate either which should've been brought together with their entrees before dessert!!! Overall not impressed here but definitely will never be back.. it'll probably only take me about 2-3 years to get over this disappointment Had an amazing experience from start to finish!!! Food was incredible!!!! Service went above my expectations....friendly staff helped us pick some wines pairings and even let us try a few dishes so I can choose the best ones to order next time!!!! Would highly recommend!!! I made reservations last minute without checking reviews, thought I would give you guys a chance because your burgers are just too good to pass up. Found the restaurant by accident after seeing one review online and ended up being very pleased with everything!! Food quality could have used a little more attention - like maybe adding salt liberally instead of sprinkling over each bite? A bit expensive when compared to other restaurants within walking distance I must say, although worth it if its something you're looking forward to eating often The copycat pizza dough had terrible texture and consistency. Not sure why copies can't make it right. Lovely spot, great service, nice atmosphere...but overall pricequality ratio isn't really high enough: (Friendly staff: Very friendly staff, especially Jacob who cooked such a delicious steak that I ordered again for lunch on the same day.

It was fresh, crisp and delicious. I have to say the menu was very appealing, especially the chicken and beef dishes. I had a great dinner. The only downside was that the check was 47.90. Not a bad dinner but not as good as it could have been. I was a little disappointed that the wine was only 14.90 and that it was not a wine I've had before.

Again, like the Rio Hotel, the price was ok for what you got. I had a great stay there on my vacation last year - all of the staff went out of their way to make sure I felt welcome! They were super friendly with our group of 4 adults! We stayed at this hotel as part of an overnight tour through Las Vegas. The room (1037) was spacious but did have one small dead area between the bed and ceiling fan so it could use some work being refurnished if we are going back. It is also quite noisy from other guests unless they go into the hallwayrooms. However, it is possible to switch off your AC unit which seems to be working fine considering it's summer time outside. Our room was clean and comfortable with a new brand of mattress pads provided by the hotel; however, they do not provide pillows or sheets. We used them when booking and saved some money depending upon how much luggage each person brought along since these items can get expensive in Las Vegas. Breakfast was included though: continental spread - eggs bacon waffles, bagels, muffins, granola, etc., coffee, tea, juice, bottled water?and many more choices than usual! There's an ATM inside the building too. Overall though, I'd say the place has improved somewhat over previous years we've visited! A bit disappointed that no breakfast available during Covid times- do u know where else i should look???? The overall experience was not bad considering COVID restrictions... No elevators must wait in line until given number then board elevator. Hot tub was clean... Everything about my visit was supposedly Covid safe...

Want to see the best that Argentina offers?! You've come to the right spot! From national parks filled with wild animals to beaches packed with sunbathers, you're bound to find something worth exploring while visiting Buenos Aires. From wine to tango, food to culture, this list features everything you need to know about Argentina's capital city - including places to eat, things to see, activities to take advantage of... it's guaranteed that you'll want to return again and again!! Set deep within the heartland of Patagonia, Torres del Paine National Park consists of two main hiking trails called Laguna Amarga and Laguna Blanca (roughly translates to: ""Amber Lake"" and ""Lily Pond. Seasonally, visitors can enjoy numerous possibilities both day hikes and night adventures. Visitors seeking adventure await. Set amidst stark landscapes surrounded by glaciers, jagged mountains and pristine lakes, Torres Del Paine National Park boasts a wide variety of options both daytrips and treks spanning several days. To begin with, just a 10-minute drive away lies a breathtaking lake known simply as Lago Grey. Situated alongside a big blue glacier, its colorful shores are absolutely mesmerizing, especially during peak viewing periods. Whilst the most popular activity throughout the park is trekking, tours can vary greatly depending on the individual's needs. For instance, a guided river raft trip would include some moderate physical exertion whilst offering beautiful views and wildlife encounters. If you're looking to spend only the morning walking, try taking a boat ride to Laguna Esmeralda, followed by an afternoon hike to Laguna Carla. This itinerary will allow you to spend less effort whilst still getting full viewings of many different kinds of plant life and wildlife."

PaLM,yelp-137,"I took our VW Passat here on Wednesday to get the oil changed. They squeezed me in, and rotated the tires too. Cool. As I was driving to Minneapolis on Thursday, I noticed a weird noise coming from the front left wheel, and it felt like the car was pulling to the left, even though the steering wheel was centered. I pulled over and checked the tire. It was flat. I called the shop to see if they could fix it, and they said they could take a look at it. I brought it in, and they said that they had over-torqued the lug nuts when they rotated the tires, and one of them had broken off. They fixed it for me, and I was on my way. So, the service was good, but I would have preferred if they had been more careful not to over-torque the lug nuts. I also would have liked it if they had told me that they had done that, so that I could have been more careful when I was driving.

Human,yelp-137,"I took our VW Passat here on Wednesday to get the oil changed. They squeezed me in, and rotated the tires too. Cool. As I was driving to Minneapolis on Friday, however, the plastic bottom covering the engineoil area (or whatever is down there, I don't really know) began to fall off. Eventually, I had to stop at a random dealership right outside of Eau Claire so that they could remove the rest of the plastic, which had been dragging on the highway. I called Goodyear, and Polly basically said oh yeah, we noticed that the bolts were stripped that hold it on, we shouldn't have put it back on. This is a common problem with VWs, and it's really not a big deal - the plastic isn't necessary for the car, it's just a pain when it actually falls off and drags. What I don't understand is why they put it back on when it was obvious to them that it wasn't going to stay on. So now it's back at Goodyear for the day. They are putting a new cover on, for free of course."
Tsinghua,yelp-137,"I took our VW Passat here on Wednesday to get the oil changed. They squeezed me in, and rotated the tires too. Cool. As I was driving to Minneapolis on Wednesday, I was thinking of all the reasons to shop at Al-Qadi. And here's the list. I have an American Passat with a rebuilt engine that was supposed to last 200,000 miles, but it's already been on the shop floor twice, for oil changes and to have the ""F"" oil filter changed. The Passat is 15 years old. Al-Qadi has a full service department with good mechanics. They have a couple of staff mechanics who are ""certified"" (but I don't know how they got certified). The shop has been around for years. The staff is friendly and they have good prices. I know they have other locations in Minnesota and I would shop there if I lived in Minnesota. The last time I went to Al-Qadi I noticed they have ""house specials"" that are different every day. That's a nice touch. I've seen them at other places, but not here. Al-Qadi has free WiFi. They also have a discount for American Express cardholders. They have a large selection of cars, from new to pre-owned, and they also have used cars that are pre-owned by Al-Qadi. They have a good selection of auto parts, and they have a large selection of motorcycle parts. Al-Qadi is not a big dealership. They don't have a big showroom, but the service area is nice and they have good parking. Al-Qadi is a well established business. They have a good reputation. Al-Qadi is in a nice neighborhood. It's in a small shopping center. The parking lot is easy to find."
LLAMA,yelp-137,"I took our VW Passat here on Wednesday to get the oil changed. They squeezed me in, and rotated the tires too. Cool. As I was driving to Minneapolis on Friday, the damn oil light came on, and it wasn't a low oil light, it was the ""I'm going to blow up and take your car with me"" light. I pulled over, and it cooled down. The damn light never came back on, so I drove home. I just happened to have an appointment there today, so I decided to go in. I asked for the manager, and he asked if he could take a look at it. It's only a coincidence that the same guys that changed the oil on Wednesday were working today. I told them that I was not happy that I just got a 40 oil change on Wednesday, and now I'm getting a free oil change today. I'm really happy with the way they handled the problem. They admitted they made a mistake, and they made it right. Yeah, it's a frickin' oil change, and they didn't do anything wrong to my car, but I'm willing to give credit where credit is due. Thanks for making it right, Firestone. Excellent. I'm glad they made it right. I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again. I LOVE my Firestone guys. If there is ever anything wrong with my car, they tell me right away. They have never, ever tried to sell me a service I didn't need. The last time I went in, they rotated my tires for free. Nice to see them treat you well, too."
PaLM,yelp-138,"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing a review.  I have been to this restaurant 3 times now and I have been very pleased each time.  The service is always great and the food is always delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Mexican food. The atmosphere of this restaurant is very casual and relaxed.  It is perfect for a casual dinner with friends or family.  The decor is simple and the lighting is dim, which creates a very cozy and intimate atmosphere.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and they always make sure that you have a great experience. The menu at this restaurant is extensive and there is something for everyone.  They have a variety of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and more.  They also have a great selection of margaritas and other drinks.  I have tried a few different things on the menu and everything has been delicious.  My personal favorites are the chicken fajitas and the carne asada burrito. The prices at this restaurant are very reasonable.  You can get a full meal for under $20.  The portions are also very generous, so you will definitely leave feeling full. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Mexican food.  It is a great place to go for a casual dinner with friends or family.  The food is delicious, the service is great, and the prices are very reasonable. Here are some specific details about my experiences at this restaurant:  The first time I went to this restaurant, I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The fajitas were cooked perfectly and they were served with a delicious guacamole and sour cream.  I also had a margarita and it was the best margarita I have ever had.  The second time I went to this restaurant, I ordered the carne asada burrito.  The burrito was huge and it was filled with delicious carne asada, rice, beans, and cheese.  I also had a horchata and it was refreshing and delicious.  The third time I went to this restaurant, I ordered the enchiladas.  The enchiladas were also delicious and they were served with a side of rice and beans.  I also had a margarita and it was just as good as the first time I had one. I have been very pleased with my experiences at this restaurant and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Mexican food."

LLAMA,yelp-138,"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing about it. Tacos al Carbon is in the Plaza Las Americas, which is the largest mall in Mexico. I don't know if there are many big malls in Mexico but it is the biggest one I have been to. It is a large two story mall and has many different restaurants and a movie theater. Tacos al Carbon is located on the second floor and is a very popular place. The restaurant is a sit down restaurant but it is a very casual restaurant. They have a variety of different tacos and each one is delicious. They also have other Mexican dishes like enchiladas, tostadas, quesadillas, and fajitas. The restaurant has a variety of different sauces for each dish but I usually order the same thing every time so I don't get too adventurous with the sauces. I always order the Chicken Tacos and they are so good! The chicken is moist and tender and seasoned to perfection. I also order a side of guacamole and it is delicious. The guacamole is made fresh at your table and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. I always get my tacos with rice and beans and I like them both so much that I have to eat them last to make sure I can eat all of my tacos. I also always order a margarita and they are amazing! They come in a variety of flavors and they are huge! I also love the atmosphere of the restaurant. They have a great patio area where you can eat outside and there are beautiful waterfalls and plants everywhere. It is a very pretty place to eat and it is very relaxing. If you are ever in Mexico and you like Mexican food than this is the place for you!"
Eleuther-AI,yelp-138,"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around writing about it. The decor is super simple and warm; the walls are painted a light tan color with modern white accents, there isn't really any artwork on display either which makes me think that they want you focused solely upon your dinner instead of selfies from Instagram pictures hanging in plain view (which can be great if people take photos before eating). The lighting was dim at first until we got our waiter who searched highlow through their kitchen looking into some back storage area where he found us two very bright lights...seriously what were these guys doing? He also asked how many items should come out yet no one had taken notice over all those minutes both groups spent waiting once seated behind closed doors stuck together inside an enclosed space! Anyway after turning off his flashlight briefly while placing several plates down during each course order along side setting them up like mini buffets only when ready did everyone get served simultaneously making things easier as far less waiters needed per table compared next time someone may visit here hopefully without being left staring idly by windows or endlessly fiddling between menus trying not miss anything important due too limited seating arrangements within such small spaces.just notewe didn't eat desserts because supposedly savory dishes make better use fo appetizers than sweeter foods since usually dinning comes afterward anyway"
OpenAI,yelp-138,I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to trying their margaritas. Do you have any recommendations for what type of margarita to try?
Human,yelp-138,"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing about it! In MY opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in terms of authenticity. I know there are a lot of trendy mexican-fusion type joints but this is just your old fashioned get your grub on type Mexican. The GOOD: The salsa is very good...fresh ingredients give it a little bit of chunk and the flavor is perfect. It is a little runny but I don't like salsa that has been thickened by paste or because it was pureed. I would rather the flavor with chunks of onion and pieces of cilantroand that is what this place offers. The BADThey serve the salsa in a very small dish and they have a disclaimer on the menu that indicates only the first two rounds of chips and salsa are free. I mean, what? I understand we are in a tough economic situation but you can't be a mexican restaurant and charge for chips and salsa. We have managed to avoid that extra charge so far. We usually just ask a different person for more salsa every time...I know, a little dishonest, but I can't help it! I expect a charge when you go to some random place and happen to order chips and salsa as your appetizer (like Chili's or something) but any standard, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place should NOT do such a thing. THE EXCELLENT: Their fresh, tableside guacamole! WOW! I had no idea avocados could have so much flavor. It was fantastic. The flavors were bold and boasted of fresh cilantro, onion, and lime! It was such a perfect combination of flavors. I have had it with the jalapenos and without...either way was incredible! I typically get the veggie fajitas and that is another reason why I love this place. TYPICALLY, if I order veggie fajitas I end up with onions and peppers marinated in salt. Azteca sends out grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes, squash, broccoli and mushrooms. They are not weighted down with sodium and dripping in a fajita sauce....they are grilled and fresh. It really is perfectly done! The beans and rice and pretty basicnothing to speak about. The flour tortillas are great and their pico de gallo is fresh and flavorful. One other downfall is that they don't give you the option for black beans on the side. But, what I found out is that black beans are not as authentic in terms of Mexican food. Muy interesante! It is definitely worth checking them out...even if it is just for their guacamole. You may want to bring your own jar of salsa though....just kidding"

The sauteed kale side. Seriously over-salted. The Brussels sprouts side. Seriously over-salted. Even the wedge salad. Seriously over-salted. Our server was pleasant and friendly, but it was obvious that this place is going downhill. I've had my fair share of meals there and really don't understand how this can happen. After mentioning to our server that we noticed the saltiness of every single item, he did offer to bring a fresh side dish, but we declined. Honestly, we were just shocked. It's a real shame. We won't be back. We had a great meal and service. One of the owners was serving us and she was awesome! We have been to other restaurants that have more ambience, but this was a great place to meet some friends. We were there on a Monday night and were the only ones in the restaurant. The waitress was very attentive and we were able to visit with her. The food was excellent and plentiful. We loved our experience. I can't recommend this restaurant. Very poor service and food quality. Had a great meal with friends on a Friday night. Service was excellent. Food was delicious. Food was very good and so was our waiter. There was a large table next to us, and the waiter was very attentive to them, but we were left waiting for refills and other things. The restaurant was not busy at all, so it wasn't like he was overwhelmed. Food was excellent. Best salmon I've had in a long time. Our server, Kara, was very friendly and attentive. Nice atmosphere. My favorite place to eat in the Naples area. The food is always delicious. I really love the waiters there. We had a reservation at 5:00, but we arrived at 4:45 and were seated immediately. The waiter was very attentive and did a great job. The food was excellent. We have been there before and will definitely return. This restaurant is one of my favorites in Naples. I was especially impressed with the waiter who served us on this visit. He was very attentive. The food was excellent. Our visit was after a funeral. The service was great and the food delicious. I've been to City Tavern twice now and each time I've enjoyed it more. The food is well-executed with fresh flavors and the portions are generous for the price. The service has been excellent as well. I'll be back. Love City Tavern! Food is very good and creative! The server we had last night was exceptional! Love City Tavern! Food is very good and creative! Our server was exceptional last night! Great service, food, and ambiance. We'll definitely be back! Had a reservation for 2 and waited 20 minutes. We were then seated in the back room and waited another 15 minutes before anyone came to our table. After that, everything was great. The server was very apologetic and the food was great. We have been to City Tavern several times. This time the noise level was very high. Also, my husband was very disappointed that the Chicken Pot Pie was not available. It is his favorite menu item. We understand that the menu is seasonal, but the pot pie was listed on the menu as available. The restaurant should not list an item on the menu if it is not available. We had to send our appetizer back because it was not cooked properly. We were disappointed and will think twice before we return. I love City Tavern. The food is excellent, and the wait staff are very attentive. My wife and I enjoy this restaurant very much. I love City Tavern. I go there all the time. The food is excellent. The food and service were great. However, the noise level was so high that it was difficult to talk with the other members of our party. We were disappointed in the food, particularly the salmon"

I had the ""small"" version of the avocado, which is a 5 oz avocado. It was extremely over-salted, which made the whole meal so over-salted. I think the best thing we had was the baked squash with goat cheese. It was light, flavorful and had a great texture. I would definitely not order the squash again. And I would not order the hummus again. We were also served a small bottle of house wine. It was an Italian white. I found the wine to be slightly too sweet. It was a very enjoyable meal, and we will definitely be going back to try something different, but I would definitely recommend ordering the ""small"" size. Absolutely not worth the price. I have had this restaurant twice now, and each time it has been different. First time was really good, food was great, presentation was good, service was great. Second time, food was ok, service was ok, presentation was good, no good on the second visit. I was told that the chefs are very busy and are unable to prepare my meal on time. I was also told that the service is very slow. I will never go back to this restaurant. We had the four courses for two with 2 bottles of wine and they were wonderful! I really loved the butternut squash soup, the risotto, and the lamb! We would definitely go back and order something different. My husband and I had dinner here last night. The food was great and our server was very nice. We ordered the 4 course menu. The first course was the best and was excellent! The lamb was good and the risotto was great. The butternut squash soup was a bit bland and not very good. The next course was the best and was very good. The pasta with chicken was very good and the butternut squash puree was a bit bland. The cheesecake was the worst of the 4 courses and was not very good. We did not finish it. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely go back. This is a restaurant that does not get enough love. It is in the midst of downtown Vancouver and is very easy to find. The staff is super friendly and attentive.

The butternut squash soup with truffle oil, salted so much you could probably drink it plain without getting sick (and a few sprinkles of cream to make up for some flavor). Don't get me started on our dinner salad - which might have been great if not all chopped tomatoes were salty!

The butternut squash tortelli would have been good if smaller for an appetizer, but as a main course the taste and consistency were too much. The filling was exactly the consistency and taste of a soggy amaretto cookie, which was the main flavor. The flavor was overwhelming after 3 torts. I had a special which I don't remember what it was called but it was chicken, pancetta, a cream type sauce and a fine, almost clear pasta. Again it was overwhelmed with salt. I know pancetta can add that saltiness, but not to this extreme. And the pasta was all stuck together. They weren't individual strands, but stuck clumps. Funny thing (not really) is, the couple right next to us had the same issue with saltiness with their meal and had one taken off of their check. The one positive was that they continued to fill our water glasses as we needed that to get through the meal."

Yes, somehow everything's related to chocolate for me). Then, I forgot to blog about them. It's a small Japanese specialty store selling Japanese daily necessities, snacks, drinks, magazines and cooking utensils. I had to make the trip all the way down to Uptown for David Bacco macha chocolates though. It's something I just can't find anywhere in Edmonton. The chocolates are so good. It's chocolate ganache with macha (green tea) flavour. They have the bars, and the boxes of chocolates (which is quite pricey). They also have chocolates of other flavours which are equally delicious. One of my favorite is the milk chocolate with orange flavour. I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate so I stick to their milk chocolates. Sadly, they're not always available. Anyway, the store has a wide variety of Japanese snacks, drinks, and cooking utensils. It's a fun place to browse around. My parents are visiting from Korea and my mom got really excited to see all the Japanese products that she can't find in Korea. The store also sells bento boxes which are so cute. They're only open for lunch, though. You're allowed to eat your bento box in the store or take them to go. When I was there, I bought some Japanese snacks, some sake, and some David Bacco macha chocolates. This store is definitely for the Japanese food lovers. Or the chocolate lovers like me."

OpenAI,yelp-141,"Margarita pizza was like out of a box from grocery sauce. The tofu fries tasted weird. The hummus was not authentic. The smoothies were watered down all I can taste I'm sorry to hear that you didn't enjoy your food. If you'd like some help, I can suggest some tips for making your own margarita pizza with fresh ingredients so it has more flavor. For example, you could use fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and aromatic herbs like basil to add flavor. As for the tofu fries, sometimes the way tofu is cooked can affect its taste. It's possible that they were overcooked or not seasoned properly. You could try making your own by marinating the tofu in a flavorful sauce and then baking or frying it to your preferred level of crispiness. For hummus, there are many recipes online that use fresh chickpeas and spices to make an authentic and flavorful dip. Try experimenting with different recipes until you find one that suits your taste preferences. Lastly, if you feel that the smoothies were watered down, you could try making your own at home using fresh or frozen fruits and a small amount of liquid like almond milk or coconut water. This way, you can control the consistency and amount of water in your smoothie."
PaLM,yelp-141,Margarita pizza was like out of a box from grocery sauce. The tofu fries tasted weird. The hummus was not authentic. The smoothies were watered down all I could taste was ice. The service was terrible. The staff was rude and did not seem to care about our experience. We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The smoothies were watered down all I can taste it and the coffee had no flavor at all. Foodtruck is amazing but they need to change their layout because its always so crowded with people waiting for food. Its too busy We ordered two orders, came very quick! This place has great food...and service really nice guys! We will come again! Love this spot - our first time here we are definitely coming back! (Even more excited now that we're in Brooklyn!):) Great location on Lower East Side!!! Love going there after working late when everything else closes!! This restaurant opened up close by my old job. Now I'm living just across the street, although making waymarks sometimes I'm still lost. Went here about a month ago while touring NYC as part of an internship experience and loved every bit. During COVID restrictions we haven't been able to go though, but it's such awesome atmosphere you can't help wanting to try lots of dishes (we tried brunch twice!). They have vegan options which I'll be sharing soon! The best brick oven pizzas I've ever eaten!! I live in New Jersey but don't get them anymore; would highly recommend trying these online and getting delivery if possible or eating off-site during covid times.... Fantastic! Had some friends over once who didn't eat meat so thought we'd order something protein-packed. Definitely worth a visit even without meats, love how they make your meal special. Good lunchtime choices; subsided well into happy hour. Great menu selection and quality foods made fresh daily. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. I have never seen anything better than what I got! Brick Oven Pizza with mozzarella cheese stuffed inside layer cake batter, sauteed artichokes, pine nuts, shaved parmesan cheese, sweet chili oil dressing, green olives, red pepper flakes, chorizo and black beans along with other goodies tossed together. Delicious!"

The chicken breast that my sister got was sooo small it looked like it was for a 6 year old child not an adult. It was very over priced for juice bar food we spend almost 50 for the both if us for lunch the funny thing we were still hungry the portion are really small.

Tsinghua,yelp-142,"Recent family lunch at the Duck, outside under the amazing eucalyptus trees, had more great sandwiches. It's so easy to get a really layered and yummy vegetarian sandwich with great toppings, but the Duck has perfected the art. There's a number of sandwiches that I've had and they are all delicious. The duck breast sandwich is fantastic, and I love the vegan brussels sprouts sandwich. The Duck also offers a great deal of vegetarian choices, such as the mushroom patty with sundried tomato pesto, or the mushroom and white bean sandwich. My favorite sandwich is the vegan brussels sprouts sandwich, with vegan mayo and fresh parsley, or the duck breast sandwich, with shiitake mushrooms and creamy vegan truffle mayo. The Duck is very happy to help you customize a sandwich if you like. The sandwich prices are a bit higher than I would like, but considering the deliciousness, it's worth it. One of my favorite places for vegetarian food is South of Market's Tender Greens, which is a very casual place that has a menu of a variety of vegetarian dishes. I always go for the Caesar salad, with the grilled chicken Caesar salad. I love the vegan bread, and I usually have a side salad as well. There are also many vegetarian and vegan entrees, and I have had the vegetarian lasagna, with zucchini noodles, and the vegan butternut squash and feta ravioli. I like the fresh veggies and I'm always happy to have a fresh vegetable salad with my meal. Tender Greens is a great place for lunch, and it's very casual and fun. My husband and I recently had lunch at Parnell's and we both enjoyed our meals. We both had the beef lasagna, which was good. The beef lasagna is a good vegetarian entree, and the vegetarian pizza is a great option for a light lunch. We also had a salad, which was good.

The server says, if you really want a 4 oz pour, I guess I could do it, but it's really only a 2 oz pour. We leave. We don't go to bars often, but I'm pretty sure if you're gonna try to bring in new people, you might try to actually make them happy. Terrible, terrible experience. 100 agree, terrible experience.

Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.

We walk in, find the bar is closed and the bartender standing by his door clutching our order slip. Two of us were there for dinner last Thursday with a friend who was new to town (and apparently one that has been using the same name as her boyfriend). The first thing she does when arriving at this place is going up to the counter asking about ""regular prices"" or if they are ""all inclusive"" vs ""no tips."" (I can't believe someone would ask me such a question... but hey...) She also asks what type of beer I want, which leads into an extended discussion of how much different beers cost (some being cheaper than others), etc. We ended up leaving because we'd had enough. She feels like all it took was some polite conversation before ordering that gave her something else to talk about other then food price or not having any alcoholic drinks available. If you see your girlfriend wifehusband just sitting around waiting until you're done talking so she can run out there buy another drink so she doesn't have to say anything then think again! Interesting story. But I'm sure you guys left soon afterward and didn't lose money, right? Or did both parties agree to pay double? The owner came back inside to apologize and said he couldn't do the regular price anymore because he'd lost the competition from 'all inclusive' nights at local spots Began taking reservations over phone, email and text earlier tonight during weekday rush hours. What people don't understand is these places get booked fast without reservation sometimes ten minutes or less before their closing time. You call them up late into the evening hoping to book a table. None show up. People try calling three times and cancel their plans only to end up rescheduling the following morning while trying to leave early to make it work."

The restaurant itself is beautiful, with lots of dark wood and exposed brick. The menu is fairly limited, but everything we ordered was delicious. We started with the oysters Rockefeller, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned. For our main course, we had the filet mignon and the salmon, both of which were cooked to perfection. The filet was juicy and flavorful, and the salmon was flaky and light. For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake, which was rich and decadent. Overall, we had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was beautiful.

Lots of reviews mention it's in a bad part of town but it didn't seem too bad to me. The food was ok, nothing too spectacular. The prices were a bit high for the quality of the food. I have always been pleased with the service and food. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. There is a diverse clientele, and I have always felt safe. If you like the food and are adventurous, go for it. I love this place. There is a lot of seating. They have lunch specials and the food is amazing. It is located in a low income area and I feel safe there. It is a great place to bring your family. I was hesitant to visit this place due to the location of this establishment. I have heard many good things and I was really excited to try it out. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an upbeat and friendly staff. The atmosphere of the place is very modern and clean. The food was absolutely amazing, i tried the chicken masala and it was incredible. They have a nice variety of different foods from the middle east. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait to go back. Food was great! Service was pretty good. Will return. I love this place, I get their food everyday for lunch. They have the best chicken kabob ever! I would highly recommend this place to anyone! I'm not sure why I waited so long to try this place! The decor was modern and clean, the service was very friendly, and the food was incredible! We were promptly seated upon our arrival and were greeted by a waiter who helped us decide on what to order. The food came out quickly and we were not disappointed! I had the kofta kabob and it was delicious! Definitely going back. The food was amazing. I ordered the chicken shawarma and it was the best chicken I've ever had! They also have a variety of drinks and desserts. I recommend this restaurant for a lunch or dinner date. The staff was very friendly and attentive. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant in all of Miami. It has a very modern atmosphere and the food is amazing. I tried their chicken kabob and it was amazing. The food is very fresh and the service was excellent. Food was excellent. Wish there were more places like this in miami."
BigScience,yelp-145,"Came here for my birthday with a friend. Parking is a pain, it is REALLY dark and the service was ok. Lots of reviews mention it's in a bad part of town so I guess that's true. I love this place! The best burgers around. We always get them on brioche bun's because we like how they hold up better than regular buns This place has to be one of the most underrated restaurants in all of Chicago. It doesn't have that high end decor or fancy seating but it's still worth checking out! Outstanding food at an exceptional price. Super attentive staff who are happy to set you up with your favorite side dishes as well. Definitely recommend passing by if you're ever hungry in the West Loop area. Love this spot....great prices good quality ingredients...very fun atmosphere....and warm-hearted people.... As far as places serving really great tasting burgers go, I'll eat there every time I'm close enough (within walking distance). Everything is top notch from starters to desserts. The server didn't even ask why i couldn't take credit card info when she gave me 2 drinks which came together in 1 glass and then told me over over again ""sorry about any inconvenience"" I'm trying to do business online since March 2020 thanksgiving day and now 8 months later and only 3 customers asked me if paypal works.."

Lots of reviews mention it's in a bad part I'm sorry to hear that your experience was not fully enjoyable. It's unfortunate that the parking situation was difficult and that the lighting was inadequate. As for the service, it's good to hear that it was at least okay, but there may be ways for the restaurant to improve upon it. As for the neighborhood, it's always a good idea to do research beforehand and be aware of any potential safety concerns."

I got the ""Winter in Miami"" cocktail which was amazing and just the right amount of spice to warm you up. I also tried the BBQ Brussel sprouts which were really good. I loved the bourbon glaze. My husband had the mushroom grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque and he said it was delicious. My only complaint was that our waitress was a bit slow. She took a long time to bring us our food and she didn't return until we were almost finished with our meal. When we ordered dessert she never returned to ask us how it was. It took a while to get the check. Food was great! Service was slow, but she was nice. The hostess was super friendly. It was a great experience. The Local is a great place to stop in for a drink and dinner. It's a relaxed, casual atmosphere and the staff is friendly. The food is prepared well and there are quite a few vegetarian options. The beer list is small, but solid, and the cocktails are delicious. Awesome food and service. We will definitely be back soon. The Local is a great place to grab a bite and a drink. The service is always great and the atmosphere is very cool. The only thing I would say is that they should have a larger selection of beer. Great food. Great service. Very cozy environment.

They have a good selection of food to choose from, and it's usually good to go. A great lunch spot, with decent prices. This is the only restaurant I have ever eaten at where the service was horrible. I went in for a late lunch and the place was packed. I was served by two different servers, one who kept asking me how my sandwich was and the other who was barely polite and made me feel like I was bothering her. The sandwich was very good, but not worth the service. Delicious!10.03.12: Posted by Cheryl H I have been coming here for years.

Terrible service. The most incompetent staff I've ever encountered.

The cashier had no idea what she was doing and the pharmacist is in the back making calls for 20 minutes instead of working. If I could give no stars I would. This pharmacy is the best. Everyone is very pleasant. They go above and beyond their duties. We love this pharmacy. They are always pleasant and so efficient. We like using this pharmacy for all of our medication needs. Awesome pharmacy! I went to pick up a prescription for my dog and they did not have it yet. They offered to run to the store and get it so I could get it that day. So friendly and helpful!

They quote wrong wait times which are frustrating and inconvenience customers. I'm sorry to hear that you're having a bad experience with the pharmacy. I can understand how frustrating it can be to feel like you aren't being given the attention you deserve as a customer. If you haven't already, I would recommend speaking to the pharmacy staff and expressing your concerns. They may not be aware of how their actions are affecting customers and may be able to better manage their time and prioritization of tasks. In addition, you could consider leaving a review or feedback on their website or social media page. This can help bring attention to the issue and encourage the pharmacy to make changes to improve their service. If you're in a rush and need your prescription filled quickly, it may be worth considering using another pharmacy that can better meet your needs."

Tsinghua,yelp-148,"First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back. We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already reserved. We took the table, paid for it, and were seated immediately. We went to the restroom, got back, and we were seated at a table of 12 (no problem there)...and we were given the ""bill"" (not our tab) to sign. We did and were told we were to wait for our food to come out. I was sitting in the back of the restaurant and had no idea what was happening until I heard the ""ca-ching"" of the credit card machine. When I walked up to see what was going on, the server was apologizing and told me that the other table had the food (and a bill) already paid for. Needless to say, we were not happy with the situation. I will not be returning. Good Afternoon,I am a new customer and would like to tell you a little about me. I am a recent college graduate with a background in Hospitality Management. I have recently been asked to help out in the restaurant by the owner, and I am very excited about it. I am very passionate about the business and the job, and I am very good at my job. I am able to work quickly and efficiently, and I enjoy my job. I have worked in several other establishments in my past, and I have worked in the restaurant business before. I am able to get the job done quickly and efficiently, and I do not waste any time at all. I have also been working in this industry for quite some time, and I have learned a lot about the business, and I am excited to share it with you. I would like to tell you a little bit about myself. I am a very friendly person, and I love to talk to people. I have a very good personality, and I love to have fun. I am always happy, and I am very outgoing. I am also very energetic, and I love to get up and get things done. I am also very hardworking, and I love to work hard. I have a good work ethic, and I am always willing to work hard. I am very dedicated, and I am always willing to put in the time and effort to do a good job. I love my job, and I love working here. I know that I can help you in the restaurant, and I know that I can do a good job for you. I would like to work for you, and I would like to be your server. I would love to talk to you, and I would love to work for you. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope to talk to you soon. The first time I was at the Maverik on Thurs, I did not notice that the whole restaurant was set up for their lunch rush. It took a while for our table to get served, and I was told that the cook was still working on our meal. I was really mad about this, because it seemed like we were getting served to much food. Our food was on the table when I left, and it was nice to have the food with me. I would have appreciated it if the server had let me know that we were getting served to much food, so that I could have been prepared. The second time I was there, I was not happy with the food. I ordered the Prime Rib, and it was a little too salty for my taste. I would have appreciated it if the server had told me that the food was a little too salty, so that I could have changed my order. My husband had the Shrimp, and he said that it was good. The next time I was there, I ordered the Salmon, and it was a little too spicy for my taste.

Human,yelp-148,"First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back. We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager, I presume, say to her You're having a great time, just by yourself, aren't you? as he placed the appetizer she had ordered on the table. After announcing ourselves, we sat and soon after the server, Beth, came to the table. Honestly, I had to check my receipt for her name because she never told it to us. Since we didn't know our drink order right away, we agreed she would return for it. At least 10 minutes later, she returns for what turned out to be our simple beer order. After we had selected our sushi choices for our meal, Beth verbally ran through the choices. After explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are not waiting, our friend asks if the Mango Tango selection can be put on a separate plate as she is allergic to mangoes. After clear confusion on the face of Beth, she stutters out I think we can do that. We were thrown by her confusion. As our first plate of rolls arrived, delivered by someone other than our server, we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table. The soy sauce pitcher on our table was almost empty as was the one on the table next to us. After about 10 minutes, Beth arrives to check on how our rolls taste and we inform her that we hadn't had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes. Beth leaves to get those items for us and tell us to get started with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher. The Mango Tango dish arrives and Beth's confusion was answered: the mango was on the side. She had apparently thought we were requesting for the mango to be in the side instead of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls. After our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company, drinking our beverages, Beth arrives and places the bill on the table, telling us she will pick it up whenever we are ready. No mention of coffee or dessert. When we hadn't touched the check for 10 minutes, Beth checks in to see if it's ready. When we told her we hadn't even looked at it yet, she says If you would like to hang out and order anything else, I can have another server assist you. I have been here since 10 and would like to close out your check. It was 9pm. After the looks on our faces expressed our disappointment with her attitude, she attempted to back peddle and essentially ended up repeating herself and thus, sticking her foot back in her mouth. Not to be insensitive at all, I, myself have been a server and a bartender in the past and I am all too familiar with pulling a double. And I have been stuck at work because of that last table that consisted of people not going anywhere. It wasn't that she wanted to leave, it was the way she told us. I had just worked a full day myself and was about to do it again the next day, in the midst of a 3 week straight work schedule with 0 days off. Once we paid our bill, cash and card combo that again confused Beth, we added our gratuity and our meal was complete. But not before Beth checked her tip while still very much in our range of vision. Oh, and the sushi? Mediocre at best and not worth going back!"

After that, I didn't see him again until after dinner was over when we were all leaving, so it seems they weren't still serving each others food. He waited like a maniac until he could get his chicken thighs on the plate as his first course. Then no one ever came up and asked if anyone wanted any dessert, even though my husband ordered two desserts because he felt better than everyone else who only drank water."
LLAMA,yelp-148,"First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back. We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already been waiting awhile and asked the waiter to check on his food (we had just ordered ours). The waiter had to ask the cooks to put our food in and told us it would be at least another 15 mins. We thought this was strange since we had already ordered and others at the table had their food. He came back and said it would be another 5 minutes. Our food finally came but my friend's did not. The waiter said it was done but it was missing the beans and rice. I asked him why they couldn't just make him a new order and he said they were waiting on the beans. Again, strange since there are always beans on the table. My friend's food finally came after another 15 minutes. By this time, the rest of the table had almost finished their food. We asked for the check. It was brought to us and I gave it back and asked if they could bring us a new check since we were going to split it and the waiter said he would need the credit card to do that. I said I would pay with the card and he could have us split it. He said he would bring us a new check. He came back with the check but we were missing a couple of drinks on the check. I asked him to bring us a new check and he said he couldn't since he had closed out our bill. I said we would just use the card to pay for it but he still insisted he couldn't do it. I then asked for the manager and he said she was on the phone. I said I would wait. The manager came and I explained the situation and she said it would not be a problem and walked away. The waiter then came back with a new check that now had the drinks on it and we were able to split it. The manager never came back to the table to see if everything was okay or if there was anything else she could do for us. The waiter also did not check on us or apologize for the wait. We felt like a burden instead of valued customers. The food was good but the service was horrible. Went to this restaurant for the first time last night with a friend and the waiter was rude. We arrived at 7:30 and there were plenty of empty tables but he seated us at a table by the kitchen. Then my friend ordered the taco salad but the waiter said they didn't have that. He offered to substitute the chicken or beef for the taco meat but my friend didn't want that. The waiter took the order anyway. Then when he brought our food, he put the salad in front of my friend and said, ""this is the taco salad."" I don't know how he didn't know what a taco salad was since it was on the menu, but then he was rude to my friend for not wanting to substitute something for the taco meat. We won't be going back anytime soon. Great food and great service. I go here every time I go to Little Rock."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-148,"First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back. We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already occupied, sat down only for about a minute then left without taking any food; I should have been more polite but we were so tired by that point it was just too much effort when you've got an hour drive home ahead! However they did make some great pizzas... The service is fast friendlyhelpful - even though there are no staff standing behind your tables anymore like on previous visits this year's visit felt better organised than last years with all waitresses working together rather well despite having multiple sections open simultaneously which made things feel busier overall as opposed earlier days where if section A wasn't busy nobody would go onto say B until C cleared out first while waiting several minutes before being able progress again into D etc.."
PaLM,yelp-148,"First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back. We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at, ordered, and received our beverages. 10 minutes later, our friend's food arrived, and we were informed that the kitchen ""forgot"" to put our orders in.  We waited another 20 minutes before one of our plates (of the 3) came out.  The other 2 orders never did come out, and when we asked the server about them, he said ""they'll be out soon"".  After waiting another 10 minutes, we asked again, and this time he said ""they're not coming out.  They're sold out of the main course you ordered"".  We asked if we could order something else, and he said no, because the kitchen was closed.  So we ended up leaving without eating.  All of us were very disappointed, and we won't be returning. Here are some specific examples of things we didn't like about our experience:  The server was very rude and unapologetic about the fact that our food wasn't coming out.  The food that we did receive was cold and not very good.  The atmosphere was loud and crowded, and we didn't feel very welcome. Overall, we had a very negative experience at this restaurant, and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

The following are just some of what I've been thinking about as we move forward towards that goal: 1) If possible, get into one of the best rental car companies out there (I have heard great things about Enterprise Rent-A-Car), and rent a full-size SUV after all our family cars, including the minivan. 2) Do a thorough cleaning of every roomliving areakitchenbathroom before leaving; use lots of paper towels andor clothes; vacuum everything thoroughly; sweep floors to eliminate dust bunnies; get rid of very old booksdrawingbooks off shelves; give away anything that's not needed while I am gone 3) Before heading out the door, pack a few items from these categories: garbage bags and trash cans; Styrofoam trayscans (you can buy them cheaply online), wood chips, (note: these don't need to go straight through your garbage disposal! The container will automatically empty itself once it's filled!) 4) Pack extra snack foods like protein bars, water packets (some stores sell them in bulk- I personally prefer Dove since their bottles look cleaner), hummus (Protein World sells lobster flavored stuff - who knows why?), etc., 5) Get used to using food processors 6) Brush teeth daily 7) Wash dishes each night 8) Make sure clothes wear well 9) Mop bathroom floor 10) Keep household clean 11) Use vinegar 12) This entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged balance budget, meals by edwardmutt1823.

Tsinghua,yelp-149,"Il Mulino Staple of NYC and My Hometown comesto Las Vegas in the new section of the forum shops on the North End of the Strip. Everything is pretty much as it should be. From a cheesecake to a hamburger. To even an omelette. I like that they have a different menu on the lower level. The quality of the food is a bit higher than you'd expect. My family and I got a few sandwiches and tried a few drinks. We didn't go to the bar, but we did try the bar. I tried a peppermint martini and it was just a little bit too sweet. I would have liked it with a little bit less sweetness. The other sandwich I tried was the bacon-wrapped hot dog. It was good. It was like a hot dog that had a little bit of a crunch to it. It had a lot of flavor and it was juicy. The service was pretty quick. I was able to get in and out in about ten minutes. It was nice. It was like a good atmosphere. There was music and there was a couple people having a nice time. It was a good environment. I think the food is good. I think the prices are reasonable. I think the service was fine. The other good thing is that it's very close to my hotel."
OpenAI,yelp-149,"Il Mulino Staple of NYC and My Hometown comesto Las Vegas in the new section of the forum shops on the North End of the Strip. Everything is pretty much set up and ready to go, except for one small issue: the restaurant's new signage has not yet been installed. The signage company has let the restaurant know that they are running behind schedule and won't be able to have the signage ready before the restaurant's opening date. As the helpful assistant, I suggest the restaurant consider some temporary signage options to utilize until the permanent signage is ready. Here are a few options: 1. Printed banners - the restaurant can have banners printed with the name and logo of the restaurant and hang them outside the entrance until the permanent signage is ready. 2. Chalkboard or whiteboard signage - the restaurant can place chalkboard or whiteboard signs outside with the name and logo of the restaurant, as well as any special promotions or menu items. 3. A-frame signs - the restaurant can use A-frame signs with the name and logo of the restaurant to attract attention from the street. 4. Sandwich board signs - the restaurant can put up sandwich board signs outside with the name and logo of the restaurant and special promotions. 5. LED signs - the restaurant can utilize temporary LED signs with the name and logo of the restaurant outside the entrance. These are just a few temporary signage options that the restaurant can consider until the permanent signage is ready. The restaurant can also consult with a sign company to discuss any other temporary signage options that might fit their needs."

A nice change from the other gay bars in town, this bar is cool, low key, has GREAT music, and if you feel like being a tourist again, all you have to do is go down the escalator and walk around Freemont. They have a coreographed drag show every half hour on fridays. It was awesome.... but my mother made a comment that made me laugh:, I would hate to be the coreographer of that group.... you know, cuz they're all Divas.

Some good options include shrimp cocktail, ceviche, crab cakes, and calamari. If you feel like something a little more substantial, perhaps you could try some fish tacos or sliders. Don't forget to pair your food with a refreshing drink - a crisp white wine or a cold beer would be perfect with oysters. Enjoy your meal!"

Are you suggesting that there is no issue with pigeons? 4242015 9:49:43 AM Ryndan: 20 years ago there were gnats EVERYWHERE.

PaLM,yelp-153,"Normally LOVE Penn Station, but today was. Greeted by a gnat infestation my Penn Station. Sooo troubled by that! Please get rid of the gnats. I will be back at Penn Station when you do. Penn Station is a major transportation hub in New York City. It is served by Amtrak, NJ Transit, the Long Island Rail Road, and the New York City Subway. It is also a popular tourist destination. Gnats are small flying insects that are often found in warm, humid environments. They can be a nuisance, but they are not typically harmful. However, they can be a problem for people with allergies or asthma. Penn Station is a large, enclosed space, which makes it an ideal environment for gnats to thrive. The gnats are likely attracted to the food and water that is available in the station. They can also be attracted to the people who are coming and going from the station. The gnat infestation at Penn Station is a problem that needs to be addressed. The gnats can be a nuisance to passengers and they can also be a health hazard. The station should take steps to get rid of the gnats so that passengers can enjoy their experience."

Dont know why Red Rock hosts this establishment???? ? I went here with a group of friends on a Saturday night and it was packed! The place had very nice decorations around Christmas time but we were still able to dine in. The menu looked great but when they brought our appetizer it didn't look like anything special so I don't feel that bad about not getting my appetizer at another restaurant. All of us decided to get another round of appetizers which included a crab cake sandwich each. We all liked them and the portions were huge for a lunch or dinner plate. Unfortunately though we ended up only having one dessert dish since none of us wanted dessert before going home from work. Worst red rock experience ever! It took 45 min just to come out of line. Our server was rude as heck, asked if he could speak english? then tried talking to everyone who came into his section. Waited over an hour for a table after being told there would be no problem because we already ordered online. Ordering 2 burgers and 1 side was fine. But waited 30 minutes then moved people into tables to have 4 more orders ready - we never got any burger patties till almost 40min later. The best hamburger I've ever eaten anywhere. Great atmosphere accompanied by amazing flavors tasty ingredients Everything was delicious including their macaroni salad. My friend's wanabee chicken satay was also outstanding! Great Pizza . Service was excellent too.. They didnt rush you either.. This is what makes me want to go back again"

BigScience,yelp-155,"I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for variety), craft beers, and signature cocktails. My favorite breweries are usually more of an experience than just drinking beer. Even though I have been to many breweries over my years as a writerwine enthusiastbeer nut, I've realized there's nowhere like going local! Staying with Washington State, check out this list of four amazing breweries located on some beautiful islands off the coast: These breweries aren't huge internationally known companies, but they do make interesting beers from unique ingredients and pretty much anything you can imagine! They also encourage their visitors to come along during harvest times so guests get the inside scoop on what exactly goes into each batch of beer... If you're looking for something slightly different, try going to one of these wineries: Wine Walk Tasting or Big Bear Vineyard Winery! You should definitely go wine tasting at Second Harvest Food Bank - if you're lucky chances are you'll even see them milling around packing cans up right next door. (Seriously!). Food entertains me enough already without having cooking videos explaining how to make things - why wouldn't someone upload recipe channels? One of the best ways to learn about food is through culinary schools; whether it's cooking techniques, how-to guides, famous chefs' recipes, or stories behind dishes...you name it, you can find all sorts of information online and below are links to two great cookbooks:"
Human,yelp-155,"I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!"
Tsinghua,yelp-155,"I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure). They have a killer growler-filling service. They have a full-service restaurant, including a bar that looks like the middle of the woods. They've got good food and they've got a full bar. Capital Brewery has it all. And they've got it all for a reasonable price. I can't say enough about the way they've managed to keep their prices down and their quality up. The beers they make are truly the best beer in the state, period. I think they're well worth the trip to the Capital. And if you're there, you should definitely check out the new brewpub, too. After your beer, get some food. There's nothing quite like a hot dog at the Capital Brewery. And if you're hungry after the beer, they have plenty of options. 4. Wisconsin's Finest: When you're a beer drinker, there are certain things that you have to do. There are some beer geeks who spend all their time talking about and debating the finer points of beer, and that's fine, I guess. But the fact is, most people just want to go out and have a good time. And the Wisconsin beer scene is full of beer bars that provide exactly that. One of my favorite things to do is go to the beer bars in the state, and the state has a lot of really good beer bars. There are a lot of them, too. In fact, it's so easy to find a beer bar in Wisconsin, it's not even funny. Most of the bars are fairly close to each other, and you can drive around a little bit and find a few bars to try. That's a good thing, too, because if you're in Wisconsin, chances are you're looking for a beer. And beer bars in Wisconsin are full of great beer. So you can stop in and get a few different beers, try a few different styles, and then decide what you want to try next. I think the Wisconsin beer scene is full of really good bars. It's a place where beer lovers go to get their beer fix. 5. The Breweries: There are breweries in Wisconsin. I'm sure you know this. I'm sure you have been to breweries in Wisconsin. But do you know which breweries are the best? I don't know about you, but I love going to breweries. And I think the Wisconsin beer scene is full of great breweries. If you're a beer drinker, you probably know that. And if you're a beer lover, you're probably a little bit obsessed with Wisconsin breweries. I think that Wisconsin breweries are some of the best in the country. I think they're well worth a trip. I've visited most of the breweries in Wisconsin, and they're all great. I think it's pretty safe to say that if you're in Wisconsin, you're probably going to go to at least one brewery. And if you're in Wisconsin, you're probably going to go to a lot of breweries. It's pretty easy to get around Wisconsin. There are lots of breweries, and they're all close enough to each other that you can get to a few of them without much trouble. And if you're a beer drinker, that's good. It means you can go to a lot of breweries. And that's a good thing. I hope you enjoyed my list of the 5 things you should do when you're in Wisconsin. I hope it makes your trip a little bit easier. I hope it makes it a little bit more enjoyable. If you have any questions, please leave a comment below, or send me an email. I'd love to hear from you."
LLAMA,yelp-155,"I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure) and distributes them throughout the Midwest. Capital also has an awesome beer garden, a great tour, and is surrounded by Wisconsin countryside. I have been to the brewery several times, including the last two visits I made to Madison. My wife and I even celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary at the brewery. Capital Brewery was founded in 1984 by Ed Januszyk and was located on the west side of Madison. The brewery moved to its current location, a converted canning factory, in 1998. In 2008 Capital Brewery produced 46,610 barrels of beer and was 48th in total US beer sales. Capital Brewery also won a gold medal for their Weizen Doppelbock in 2006 at the Great American Beer Festival. Capital Brewery is one of the only breweries in the United States that is still a production brewery in a true sense of the word. Capital employs six copper kettles to brew their beer. They only produce lagers, which require much longer cooling times than ales. The brewery tour was great. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the brewery and the beer. We got a chance to see the entire brewery, including the bottling line and packaging area. The beer garden is definitely one of the high points of the brewery. They have a huge beer garden that overlooks the Wisconsin countryside. There is live music and food is served. They even serve brats, a Wisconsin staple. The beer is also really good. I think the Winter Skal is one of the best holiday beers around and I always try to pick up a six pack or two whenever I can find it. Capital also brews one of the best wheat beers I have ever had, Capital Wisconsin Amber. Capital Brewery is a great brewery and if you are ever in Madison, Wisconsin you need to make a stop. Labels: Beer, Beer History, Brewery, Capital Brewery, Wisconsin I agree, I really like Capital beer, especially the Amber Wheat. I miss Capital Brewery! Their tours are the best and the beer garden is so relaxing. My husband and I always make sure to get there whenever we're in Wisconsin. I agree with the first comment, the Amber Wheat is amazing."

Capital Brewery makes some of the best German lagers in the country. Their flagship beer, Capitol Pale Ale, is a classic American pale ale that's perfect for any occasion. Their Bock is another great option, and it's perfect for enjoying on a cold winter day.  The brewery is beautiful. Capital Brewery is located in the heart of Middleton, Wisconsin. The brewery is housed in a historic building, and the grounds are beautifully landscaped. It's a great place to visit, and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.  The food is delicious.

It's in most all food that is I understand your concern about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food. Genetically modified crops have been controversial for many years because of concerns over the safety of consuming these products. However, there are currently no convincing scientific studies that show that GMOs are harmful to human health when eaten in foods. Nevertheless, if you prefer to avoid GMOs in your food, you can look for labels or certifications that indicate that a product is non-GMO or organic. Additionally, you can choose to eat whole, minimally processed foods rather than highly processed foods, as GMOs are more commonly found in processed foods. In terms of McDonald's, the restaurant chain has stated that they use some foods that contain genetically modified ingredients, but they are working to reduce the amount of GMOs in their products. They have also committed to sourcing more sustainable and responsibly raised meats and dairy, as well as offering more plant-based options. It is ultimately up to you to decide whether or not to eat at McDonald's based on your personal beliefs and preferences."

Location is great...hotel is in the middle of everything. Conveniently located right off of the strip in the heart of Las Vegas. We had a good time staying at the Planet Hollywood. The location is close to the strip, but off of the strip. The rooms were spacious. We stayed at a suite and it was nice. My only complaint is that they only offer 2 bottles of water for free and 12 for another bottle. The water should be free since you can only have 2 bottles in your room at a time. The valet parking is the only parking, but they do have a lot of valets. Also, you have to pay a 10 fee for the valet parking. I thought that was a little much. Overall, I had a good experience with the hotel and would recommend it. Very good hotel in a great location. This was our second stay at Planet Hollywood. The first was about 4 years ago. We had a very good stay and decided to stay again. The hotel has been updated since the last time we stayed and the room was very nice. My family and I have stayed here every time we come to Vegas. This time we had a hard time getting to our room because of the construction going on in the hotel. Once we got up to our room, we had a great time. We will always stay here when we come back to Vegas! Overall it was a good stay. The hotel staff was friendly and they were very helpful. However, there was a lot of construction going on and you could hear it from our room. It was a bit of a noise but not a deal breaker. This was the third time I have stayed at Planet Hollywood for my annual trip to Vegas. The location was great and the rooms are nice. The casino wasn't as nice as some of the other resorts. It seemed as though a lot of the gaming tables were closed for renovations. I also like to play a lot of video poker and this casino seemed to have more slot machines. The location of the hotel was very good. The room was spacious, had a great view and was clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. I enjoyed my stay here. The location was very good.

BigScience,yelp-158,"Love the hotel....staff is outstanding and so helpful. Rooms are very nice especially when you get an upgrade. One bedroom suites are HUGE! Location is great...hotel is in the middle of downtown, but not too far from everything. The hotel rooms were spacious with a large bathrooms for relaxing after long days at work or sightseeing around town I had two nights here while on business trip to Portland. The staff was extremely friendly accommodating. I received my room upgrades both times that i stayed there. And it was absolutely clean - much cleaner than other hotels I've been staying in. Breakfast area to be honest wasn't huge, though they did have free coffee every morning (and good stuff). But still, it couldn't hold all guests. Would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a budget-friendly staycation! We love our new suite! It has a separate sitting roomkitchenette, which makes entertaining easier and more comfortable. We also really appreciate having complimentary breakfast included!! I can't say enough about how amazing and supportive Jennifer Mellemire is as well as her team. She went out of her way to make sure we could enjoy our wedding day without any stress whatsoever and her communication skills are unbelievable!!Thankful for them!!! Excellent location close to major attractions such as City Hall, Oregon Convention Center, downtown shopping areas. Also one block away from the beautiful park where tourists stop by before heading into Downtown Salem. Room was very clean. Staff was incredibly friendly and efficient. Will definitely return next time I'm in Salem. These guys go over and above just making your travel experience easy. They helped us change dates twice within 24 hours each time because of work commitments; however they always made sure they got things done efficiently no matter what. If you're traveling alone it's worth taking some extra steps to find someone who knows exactly what you want and can help take care of small tasks like setting up wifiinternet etc. When booking via they asked me to submit a credit card information through PayPal. Upon arrival, I learned that does not accept American Express cards and thus refused their request. When I called the front desk, they said they'd send me a bill. After submitting a cancellation form online they never emailed back with updated info. So I ended up paying full price instead. Daily Dishwasher Repair"

LLAMA,yelp-159,"This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy. They sell their rolls in 3 different sizes (regular, large, and ""super"" which is what you see in the picture). The veggie rolls are the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The rolls are so big, you can get by on just one. I also love the Yummy Yummy roll. So yummy. They have a ton of rolls on their menu, with creative names to boot. Check them out. I love this place. I've been in the area for two years, and I've been back to Sushi Too several times. I always get the Dragon and the California rolls. The portions are always generous, and the rolls are always delicious. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other rolls. The service is always great, and the wait staff is always attentive. I'd recommend this place to anyone. I LOVE SUSHI! I have eaten sushi all over the world, and this place is by far my favorite. The sushi is made to order, and is so fresh. I haven't had a sushi roll here that I didn't like. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great. If you're new to sushi, this is a great place to start. If you're a sushi connoisseur, this is the place for you. Check it out. I love Sushi Too. I eat there almost every week. The sushi is great, and the prices are reasonable. I love the atmosphere, and the staff is always friendly. I would highly recommend checking it out."
PaLM,yelp-159,"This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy. They sell a wide variety of sushi, sashimi, and other Japanese dishes, and everything I've had has been delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the prices are reasonable. My favorite thing to order is the spicy tuna roll. It's made with fresh tuna, avocado, and cucumber, and it's topped with a spicy mayo sauce. It's so good that I can't help but order it every time I come in. I also love the California roll. It's made with crab, cucumber, and avocado, and it's also topped with a spicy mayo sauce. It's a classic sushi roll that's always a good choice. The staff at this restaurant is always friendly and helpful. They're always happy to make recommendations, and they're always willing to answer any questions you have. The prices at this restaurant are very reasonable. A basic sushi roll will cost you around $10, and a more elaborate roll will cost you around $15. The prices are very comparable to other sushi restaurants in the area. Overall, this is a great sushi restaurant. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend it."
BigScience,yelp-159,"This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy. They sell the best udon pasta (I highly recommend their spicy version) that I've ever had anywhere. We were leaving when we stopped here to grab some fried rice - they have an awesome selection of dishes made with fresh ingredients including shrimp tempura, scallops, crab sticks, chicken katsu etc... The food was delicious! Located on Church St., this small restaurant serves breakfast every day but also has plenty of great sandwiches and salads as well."
Tsinghua,yelp-159,"This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy. They sell sake, but not as much as I'd like. (And you know I'm always looking for good sake!) There are lots of different rolls, and I'm usually happy with whatever they have. If I had to choose, I'd go with the tuna roll. It's pretty good, but I can't quite decide if it's my favorite. It's definitely a keeper though! And their tempura is great. Just ask for it crispy. (Though I think it's better served rare.) For a special occasion, I'd definitely recommend the Japanese Prime Rib. It's huge! If you can get it, you can get it medium rare. You can't beat that! The chef told me it took him two days to prepare it, and that he cooked it in his kitchen. It's also 45! But that's okay. It's worth it! This place is awesome. And if you can't get it, just go with the Prime Rib Roll. It's not half bad! And it's only 24! (I think I paid 25.) If you're going to have it, I'd recommend it. And their sashimi is good too. Just make sure you ask for it well done. (I always ask for it rare, and it's always good!) I'd also recommend the Korean Pork. It's great. I usually have it on the half shell with lettuce and a side of a Korean sauce. It's very tasty! The seaweed salad is great too. And I've been trying to get the sushi roll I saw in the window. It looks good, but I can't decide what it is. It's pretty good though! This place is awesome! It's a little bit off the beaten path, but that's part of the charm. And I can always find parking. The view is amazing. You're looking at the New Pittsburgh Forge in the background. And it's just gorgeous. They serve some great pizza, and the specialty is the Prosciutto Pizza. It's topped with prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula, and a marinara sauce. It's just awesome! It's always worth the drive. I'd recommend getting the New York Cheesecake. It's not as good as the Cheesecake Factory's, but it's still pretty good. I can get it for about 10. And it's pretty good. And it's one of the better cheesecakes I've had. I don't like too much frosting, but this one is just right. It's the best cheesecake I've had in Pittsburgh. This place is awesome. I'd recommend the Buffalo Chicken, though it's pretty good with or without the Buffalo sauce. I don't like it with the sauce, but I can get it with it if I want. I'd also recommend the Brisket. It's great! And they have some good soups. I'd recommend the Chicken Noodle. It's not bad! And the meatloaf is good too. And the sandwiches are pretty good. But the soups are the best. And the fish and chips is good too. And the fries are great! They have some great fried chicken too. And the BBQ ribs are great. I'd recommend getting them well done. I've tried the sausage too, and it's pretty good. I've also tried the homemade pizzas. They're good. I'd recommend the Hawaiian. It's a good pizza. I'd also recommend the garlic knots. They're pretty good. I'd recommend getting the pizzas with sausage. They're just as good as the ones without. And the homemade pizzas are great. And they have some good salads. I'd recommend the Shrimp and Crab Salad. It's pretty good. And they have some great soups. I'd recommend the Shrimp Bisque. It's just great. And I'd also recommend the Salmon Chowder. It's great. And they have some great burgers too. I'd recommend the Smoked Turkey burger. It's pretty good. And the soups are the best. They're pretty good. I'd recommend the Shrimp Bisque. It's just great. And I'd also recommend the Salmon Chowder. It's great. And they have some great soups. I'd recommend the Shrimp Bisque. It's just great. And I'd also recommend the Salmon Chowder."

Human,yelp-159,"This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy. They sell prepared bento boxes (made fresh each day), as well as a handful of hot Japanese entrees (chicken teriyaki, udong). I've never had anything here I didn't love, but I'm personally partial to the rainbow roll, Oxford roll, and inari (stuffed fried tofu). If you're not very hungry, the salmon or cucumber maki are light and tasty. The family that runs the place and their employees are some of the friendliest people, and always stop to ask how you're doing and how your meal was. In terms of ambience, well, it's a food court, but the restaurant itself is fairly isolated. I've had a few lunch meetings here and haven't had a problem with it being too loud, even when it's busy. Prices are decent - I usually wind up paying around 15 for a roll and a drink. The only downside is that they don't take credit cards, so bring cash."

Not sure if we will be coming back. This place has been around for a while but it's always crowded! The food's good, but sometimes they have to rush it through because of traffic or how busy it gets (they had to do that with burgers as well). It was really nice having breakfast before our trekking tour so you could enjoy some delicious Chinese cuisine! While on vacation at this hotel, check out these attractions nearby - Fishing Pier of Haikou City (1 km), China Customs House (2.4 km) and Tianjin Square (3 km). I booked 4 nights here during our 2 week trip to Hainan. Super convenient location right next to Huanggang Railway Station which means we only needed 1 ride there instead of several transfers by taxismotorbikes. (We were able to save about 50 RMB!) This hotel offers free shuttle bus servicetaxi services fromto the airport- some even up until midnight when exhausted after long flightsthe drive home. We also got complimentary breakfast and continental buffet dinner included so no need to worry about paying extra. Our room on 2nd floor was very spacious enough for us both plus comfortable bed. They provided all kinds of amenities like fridge, hairdryer, ironing board etc.. There are many restaurants close by too including fast food places and Western-style ones (we tried Bistro 21). Price wise, this hotel was more expensive than most budget hotels but still affordable considering its location facilities. The property is located within walking distance from the train station where visitors can easily reach various tourist destinations across the island via public transport such as buses or trains."

Human,yelp-161,"This place was gross! My water tasted like a toilet. We ordered a cheese crisp, which was over cooked. The fajitas for two was more like for three (could have gotten the regular size). I was excited when I first saw them because I was so hungry!! Then, I took a bite and was disgusted! I don't know what spices they use, but it is not good. Who can ruin fajitas? Usually I can tolerate any quality of Mexican food. Just put a little salsa on it and it will be edible. I tried a second bite and wanted to choke! I couldn't eat it. Even my husband thought they were bad but he choked them down. We didn't tell the server because we didn't want to complain. I ate the chips and salsa which was ok. My husbands beer came in a margarita glass. We sat on the patio, we were the only ones there, and it seemed like every five minutes one of the workers was opening the door to look at something in the back. I don't know if they were worried about us leaving or if they were waiting on a drug run;) The server was nice but slow and forgetful. Additionally, the food is waaaayyyyyy over priced. You are much better off going to Raul and Theresa's or even filibertos....lol."

LLAMA,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a Groupon to use and had never been. When I read the description of Focaccia Fiorentina it basically said that they have the best panini's in town, I am not sure if I would agree but this sandwich was still pretty damn good! I went with the Carne Focaccia which is a meat filled focaccia bread sandwich. The bread was the best part, and when you think of a focaccia you think of the bread, thick, dense, soft, and chewy. It was all of those things. The bread was amazing, and when you combine that with the meat inside of it, it was great. The meat was decent, it was a little on the cold side but it was still good. The meat had some sort of red sauce on it that was delicious. The bottom line is, this sandwich was good and if you find yourself in the Bellaire area stop on by and get one. You'll have to excuse my non-quality photos, I didn't realize that I was going to review this place and had to take photos of my leftovers that I took home. I would advise you to go at lunch because they have their lunch specials. For example, Melissa had the Focaccia Fiorentina (the one that I had) and I had the Focaccia Pugliese (chicken focaccia sandwich) and it was a little less then 15.00 for both sandwiches! A good deal if you ask me! Overall, I would have to say that this place was good. The sandwiches were good, the service was good, and the location is good as well. I will have to say that it is on the smaller side and the dining area is kind of tight but I will come back. Just a side note: They have these paninis that are 12 inches long and 6 inches wide, they are HUGE. If I remember right it was like 10.95 or something like that. Here is the information for Focaccia Fiorentina, go check it out!"
Tsinghua,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a number of local wines and she was getting a bottle of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano from Alessandro di Marco of Veneto, Italy. This wine is a tad on the expensive side at around 20 but I do think it is worth it, it is a white burgundy that is aged in French oak and the tannins are like silk, and the fruit is a delicate mix of red berries, it is not overwhelming. Alessandro di Marco is one of the few winemakers in Veneto that is producing his own grapes, he makes his own vinification, and this is what makes him stand out from the crowd. This wine was originally made in 1990 and he recently brought it back out, he is one of the few winemakers that has been able to bring back vintages from 20 years ago and make them better than they were originally. The Focaccia Fiorentina, (more like Focaccia Vigna di Chiara, haha), is made from Sangiovese, Trebbiano and Grana. It is a delightfully sweet and crunchy sandwich bread that I have been making for the past two years and it is one of the best breads I have ever made, I was quite impressed with it, I have never made bread before and it was the first time I used a sourdough starter. The recipe for the Focaccia Fiorentina can be found in the book, Nom Nom Paleo by Emily and Liz MacLeod, it is one of the best books on Paleo that I have ever read. It is filled with great recipes, and tips on cooking, eating, and living a Paleo lifestyle. I highly recommend it, I have read it twice, it is filled with good information and great recipes. I would also recommend this book if you are looking for a cookbook that is not filled with chocolate chip cookies and macarons, you will be amazed at what you can do with the ingredients that you have on hand, and you will learn a lot about cooking and baking. I really enjoyed this book and I think it is a great addition to any home cook's library. I really enjoyed this bread, I am not a bread person, but this is the best bread I have ever made. It is very easy to make, I am sure it will become a staple in my kitchen. I love the texture of the bread, it is soft, and crumbly. It is not sticky at all and the dough is very easy to work with, I could see this becoming a regular in my kitchen. This is definitely a keeper. If you are a bread lover like me, I would definitely give this recipe a try, it will become a staple in your kitchen. This recipe makes two loaves of bread. 10.5 oz 100 organic all-purpose flour 2 oz 100 organic white flour 1.5 oz 100 organic stone ground whole wheat flour 1.5 oz 100 organic unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tsp 200 organic sea salt 1.5 tsp 100 organic white miso 12 tsp 100 organic active dry yeast 2 tbsp 100 organic canola oil 2 tbsp 100 organic extra virgin olive oil 12 tsp 100 organic Italian seasoning 2 tbsp 100 organic extra virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing on the bread 12 tsp 100 organic Italian seasoning, plus more for sprinkling on the bread (optional) 12 tsp 100 organic garlic powder, plus more for sprinkling on the bread (optional) 12 tsp 100 organic dried oregano, plus more for sprinkling on the bread (optional) 12 tsp 100 organic rosemary, plus more for sprinkling on the bread (optional) 1. Preheat oven to 425F. 2. Combine the flours, salt, miso, and yeast in a large bowl. Add the oil and the Italian seasoning and mix until the dough is combined. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. 3. Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, turning once to coat the top of the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. 4. Divide the dough in half."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased some truffle oil and she wanted to learn how we make this. As you can imagine there is not alot more info on making focaccccia compared other breadspastries so if anyone has any tips or tricks please share them! Use your favorite olive oils such as iberico for Italy- by far my fave flavor (although all three taste great)"
OpenAI,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a book about traditional Tuscan cuisine and wanted to try out some recipes. Focaccia Fiorentina was one of the recipes that caught our eye. It's a simple yet delicious flatbread made with flour, yeast, olive oil, salt and water. It's traditionally served alongside a platter of cured meats and cheeses, but it's also great on its own as a snack or quick meal. Would you like the recipe for Focaccia Fiorentina?"
BigScience,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased their Caffe Americano and was very impressed! The place is small so you have to be up for early mornings (I did) or make reservations. My coffee was wonderful - no aftertaste - rich, creamy not too sweet!! We also ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich which we both really liked as well. The Italian bakery has been my go-to restaurant on vacation for years now. Every time I've taken one trip back home that's when it's opened its doors again! It offers an amazing variety of freshly baked breads; pastries filled with irresistible fruits such as strawberries and figs, cakes made by hand out of pure white sugar and more delicious than anything I've ever seen in store at another bakeries around LA. The food offered there consists mostly of salads, cold meats, pizzas, pasta dishes etc.. But however good they are of course, those can only sustain your hunger until lunchtime that comes later then.... One thing I might add though: As soon as someone begins to eat the fattest part of the pizza usually the bottom crust he will lighten up a little bit:) This spot is widely known throughout Los Angeles sports circles as ""The Pit"" as a result of venue's name being used during professional boxing matches over the past 17 decades. Whether you're a fan of baseball, football, basketball or hockey; if there's a game going you'll find some kind of entertainment taking place right behind the scenes at this restaurant! I love Italian cuisine and this shop definitely lives up to its reputation... They sell all kinds of sweets including cannoli, tiramisu, pound cake, candied orange peel and much more... It's beautiful inside and outside.. It's quite cozy and inviting. You must visit ""Giorgio' if you've never done before We live just across the street from Piazza del Valentino and always walk over there whenever I'm craving something special. This is a deceptively simple looking bakeryrestaurant, yet every bite is full of flavor and deliciousness. Our favorite item there is biscotti alla genovese, a classic crunchy cookie dough treat that anyone who loves cookies should try some day. In addition to putting together fine desserts and savory treats they're getting ready for summer events by selling hot drinks and ice cream sandwiches in vintage-style glassware. My father-in-law visited us last weekend while visiting his daughter in LA and stayed overnight at the Hyatt Regency Beverly Hills Hotel. He had dinner there and said the cooking staff were excellent especially serving his steak dish, although service wasn't great, so perhaps he's got a stomach condition? Either way, he enjoyed himself immensely and we're sure he'll come back again sometime soon. Find out what other folks think about Berthoud Village Apartments below.

PaLM,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens. I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a gift card for her birthday. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining and the birds were singing. We walked around the square and took a look at the market. There were so many different stalls selling all sorts of things, from fresh fruit and vegetables to clothes and souvenirs. We bought some bread and cheese to have with our picnic lunch. We found a spot on a bench in the shade and sat down. We unwrapped the bread and cheese and started to eat. The bread was fresh and warm and the cheese was delicious. We were both so hungry and we were enjoying the peace and quiet of the square. We sat there for a while, just enjoying the day. After we had finished eating, we walked around the square a little more. We stopped to look at the fountain and the statue of the Madonna. We also stopped to admire the beautiful architecture of the buildings around the square. We finally made our way back to the car. We were both feeling relaxed and happy. We had had a great time exploring the city and we had made some new memories. Focaccia Fiorentina is a traditional Italian bread that is made with olive oil, water, flour, salt, and yeast. It is baked in a wood-fired oven until it is golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Focaccia Fiorentina is often served with olive oil, salt, and rosemary. It can also be topped with cheese, meats, or vegetables. Focaccia Fiorentina is a delicious and versatile bread that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It is a perfect addition to any meal and is sure to please everyone."
Human,yelp-162,"Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a 2 coupon from that online place (wink wink) that let us buy 35 worth of food for only 10. Needless to say, after all the restrictions of the coupon (minimum 2 people, dine-in only), we had enough food for an italian army! Still, it only cost 10 and I was hungry! I got the 3 sandwich which had Genoa Salami, Moz, Tomatoes, on (you guessed it) Focaccia bread (pardon my french, er.... italian). She got the 6 which had Turkey, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember. We also ordered the Penne (something) Vodka. You know you're an alcoholic when all you remember is the vodka part! Oh, and a large greek salad. Finally, we passed our 35 minimum and we sat down with all this food. People were staring at us all hateful like we stole this food from ethiopians or something! Geez! I didn't know there was a law against ordering this much food. We weren't going to eat it all there, I promise! We got boxes! Yes, Plural! The food was great, the lady that greeted us, not so much. We must have interrupted her break, because she was giving me the stink eye. Yes, can I order the 3? Ugh! Did you see that?!?! Why is it that Italians have the best of everything? The tastiest sandwiches, the tastiest pasta, the tastiest bread, the tastiest men.... ahem, sorry. got carried away. But its true! Everything about italy is awesome. Pizza!

This was my first visit to McCormick and Schmick's in San Antonio for their new location on Eighth Street. The atmosphere is very nice with plenty of seating including tables near the fireplace which I found comfortable during this cool Texas night. I ordered steak which came with mashed potatoes gravy as well as fries which were also served piping hot thus adding to experience. There are no hidden fees or surprises like most fast foods would do due to pricing being competitive with other establishments at around 9-11 per item depending upon how much you order. There are many options when it comes to dining out in our area. While some will argue that eating somewhere downtown may be more fun than walking through traffic on Frisco Drive towards home, there is something about heading off down busy streets just before dark after work then finding a cozy spot by the waterfront that's perfect for dinner followed by drinks (or not if you're afraid of spoiling your appetite). My wife and I decided to venture into Midtown restaurants while we waited for an early game between the Cowboys and Raiders last week (so sorry to be unfriendly) and take advantage of the citys amazing offerings outside of San Marcos. While romantic restaurants often hold up better nights romantically speaking, there's nothing wrong with making those who love each others company choose from a variety of options based solely on convenience.

OpenAI,yelp-164,"Service was really great! My friend and I came in on a Wednesday and there was only 1 other person in line. Since I had never eaten at Pinkberry before, the person working behind the counter was super helpful in explaining how everything worked and recommending some of their most popular flavors and toppings. They even let us try a few different flavors before we made our decision. The store was really clean and well-organized, and the staff seemed genuinely happy to be there. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely come back again!"
LLAMA,yelp-164,"Service was really great! My friend and I came in on a Wednesday and there was only 1 other person in line. Since I had never eaten at Pinkberry before, the cashier offered me a sample to try. I thought that was a great idea since I was a newbie. We both ended up getting the Original tart frozen yogurt, which had a really good taste. The lady behind the cash register even asked us if we wanted to buy one of their Pinkberry branded spoons. You would think this place is trying to charge you for everything you order, but it's really not like that. The prices are reasonable and the people are really nice. I would totally recommend eating here! Pinkberry's opening here in San Diego was kind of a big deal, as it is a California-based chain. I've been meaning to go for a while, but finally got the opportunity last night. It was a nice place and the people were friendly. I got a large tart with fresh fruit. It was a little pricey (about 7), but the serving size was pretty big. The yogurt itself was good, but I did find it a bit tart. The fresh fruit was delicious though and my favorite part. I'll probably give them a second chance when I'm in the area, but I don't know if I'll ever go out of my way to visit. I'm sure a lot of you have heard of Pinkberry, but for those of you who haven't, it is a self-serve yogurt place with a variety of toppings. You choose from their many flavors, and then add toppings of your choice. They charge you by the ounce, so the more toppings you add, the more expensive it is. I thought the price was a little steep, but I suppose it's comparable to other places. I did not like the yogurt itself at all. It was very tart, which is not my preference. I thought the toppings were good though. I would recommend it for the toppings. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but I don't live in the area. I finally had an opportunity to go here, and I thought it was pretty good. The self-serve yogurt was a little bit of a different experience for me. I got a small (which was still a lot) and I could have chosen from 10 flavors. I ended up getting the dark chocolate and the peach. I thought the dark chocolate was delicious, but the peach was a bit too tart for me. I did like the variety of toppings. I got fresh strawberries, kiwi, and blueberries. The people were friendly and the price was pretty reasonable. It's a little expensive, but they give you a lot. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in the area."
BigScience,yelp-164,"Service was really great! My friend and I came in on a Wednesday and there was only 1 other person in line. Since I had never eaten at Pinkberry before, we ordered the same thing as my friend, which was a pizza with shrimp (which she LOVED) and spicy scallops for me since that's what I most enjoy. This is BY FAR one of our favorite places to eat out at night when I'm not having family over or going out for dinner...and it's so inexpensive!!! We usually get about 5-10 worth of food that lasts us until midnight or later."
Human,yelp-164,"Service was really great! My friend and I came in on a Wednesday and there was only 1 other person in line. Since I had never eaten at Pinkberry before, the girl that served us was really helpful in explaining how they work compared to most places (no self-serve, no price based on weight) and about the flavors. There weren't many flavors (namely, no vanilla) which was kind of a downer, but the fresh toppings and the quality of the fro-yo really made up for it. The original was somewhere in between greek yogurt and vanilla ice cream. I had oreo topping, which made the whole thing taste like cookies and cream ice cream, with a lot less calories. The store is very small with only a few tables close together but the Arboretum has plenty of benches and seating around it to use. The price was pretty reasonable for the amount received. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-164,"Service was really great! My friend and I came in on a Wednesday and there was only 1 other person in line.

The price was very reasonable for the size of the pie. The service was excellent! We had to wait about 10 minutes for our pie, but that was the only wait time we had. They were very attentive and polite, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Pinkberry to my friends and family! My husband and I went to Pinkberry in Green Bay. The restaurant was full of people. We were able to get a table and waited a little while for our order. My husband and I were so hungry we ordered a bunch of things. The pie was delicious and the ice cream was very good too. I love the fact that they have so many flavors of ice cream and the fact that you can get the ice cream in cones, cups, and baskets."

Tsinghua,yelp-165,"Fast service considering the crowd that was there while I was. Just like any Tropical Smoothie location the drinks are delicious and reasonably priced. I've never had the sour juice drink before but I'm going to try it soon. I have the smoothies every day so I'm not looking forward to the return of the store, but I do appreciate the loyalty they have to me and the smoothies I enjoy. I've had the Strawberry Cooler 24 times since I moved to the area. I was really excited when they opened up the new location on 23rd and I immediately went there. I have to say I was a little disappointed. The drinks are very sweet and have no flavor. I was told that it was a new formula and that they were trying to change it but I still felt it was very sweet and not worth the price. The only drink that I would try again is the Apple Berry. I'm a Smoothie lover and I'm glad that they finally opened up a location. I do have to say that the smoothies aren't as good as they used to be. The prices have gone up and the quality is not as good as it used to be. They used to have a bunch of different options and now you have to pick a basic drink and add the fruits you want. Not only are the smoothies more expensive, but the variety is not as good as it used to be. I will still continue to go there because I enjoy the smoothies, but I do wish that they would change things up a bit. The smoothies are the best I've ever had, so I'm glad they finally opened up another location. I've been to their new location on 23rd and S. Houston. The smoothies are great and very good value for the price. I really like the new Tropical Smoothie 15. The only downside is that they only offer a small cup of coffee. I would recommend Tropical Smoothie 15 if you're in the area and want a great smoothie and a great value. I am a huge smoothie fan and I've been going to Tropical Smoothie 15 since I was a freshman in high school. I had the opportunity to work at Tropical Smoothie 15 as a part time summer employee. My coworkers and I are really excited about the new location opening up in the shopping center on S. Houston. We have the opportunity to meet new people and do what we love to do. I will be continuing to go to Tropical Smoothie 15 for all of my smoothie needs. They are my favorite smoothie shop and I'm glad that they finally opened up a new location. Tropical Smoothie 15 has been a great place for smoothies since the first time I tried it. The quality and taste are fantastic and I have yet to have a bad smoothie. The only thing I don't like is that the prices are pretty high, but the prices are still better than many other smoothie places. I love that the location is convenient to me, and I'm looking forward to the new location opening up in the new shopping center on S. Houston. I have tried Tropical Smoothie 15's smoothies since they first opened and I have never been disappointed. I live in the north side of the city and I can't imagine that the new location won't be a good location for people to go to. I will continue to go to Tropical Smoothie 15 because it is my favorite smoothie place and I am looking forward to the new location opening up in the new shopping center on S. Houston. I love that the new location will be in the same shopping center as the first location. The new location is going to be better for the surrounding area. I love the new location because it is going to be close to my work and I'm going to get a new smoothie. I've been to Tropical Smoothie 15's new location on 23rd and S. Houston and I really like the new location. I like the new location because it is closer to me and I'm going to get a new smoothie. I'm going to continue to go to Tropical Smoothie 15 because it is my favorite smoothie place and I like that they are finally open in the new shopping center on S. Houston.

Very nice atmosphere, very friendly people. Good service, but not enough help. I love the drinks and the service. Great food, great service. Great experience. Came through the drive thru and the young lady was so nice and helped me pick a smoothie. Food was delicious and service was great. My favorite place to go."

Tsinghua,yelp-166,"For the price the Tuesday buffet is great! There's plenty to eat. If you like seafood, there's great options for you. I've eaten there 4 times and always come back for more! You don't have to be on a diet to enjoy the buffet. You just have to be willing to share. The prices are right. I'm not sure about the prices on the Monday buffet. For the price, I'd expect better.

The food is always good, the staff is friendly, and it's the best deal in town. It's not the most exciting breakfast, but it's still a good breakfast. I would not recommend the breakfast buffet on Mondays. I haven't been there in over a year, but it's been bad for a long time. The food is average, the waitstaff is terrible, and it's expensive.

BigScience,yelp-166,"For the price the Tuesday buffet is great! And I love that you can tell they are using local ingredients whenever possible. Oh man, where to start?! The food was amazing and tasty. Everything we ordered (besides one thing) was absolutely fantastic!! We all left feeling pretty full which made for a perfect weekend on Long Island! The service at both locations were impeccable from waiterwaitress to bar staff, very attentive, friendly, efficient and professional. Very happy with our dining experience overall!! Just found out about this place last night. Went there tonight with my son and 2 of his friends. Food was excellent as usual but what really caught us off guarded how good the bottomless mimosas were. They have actually done an awesome job balancing the alcohol content in their beverages since now its not just like any other club that shakes up cocktails only slightly....this particular venue has managed to throw together something unique while still retaining some old school stuff too. As always the drinks were superb and definitely kept everyone entertained. Great group atmosphere and location right by the beach...we will certainly be back again soon I was lucky enough to get a ticket to MIMOSA's Opening Night party last week! It was Awesome!!! Then i got tickets to last friday morning and had another blast!!! All that said the Disco never sets it down!! If u don't know who or what Mimosa's is try them sometime!! You won't regret it!!!"
PaLM,yelp-167,I was disappointed when I came here! I came here because we wanted some food after a long night and somewhere close! We were staying at the venetian and we decided that this would be a good place to go. We were so disappointed! When we got there it was really loud and not very inviting. The staff was not very friendly and the food was not very good. We would not recommend this place to anyone.
Tsinghua,yelp-167,"I was disappointed when I came here! I came here because we wanted some food after a long night and somewhere close! We were staying at the venetian and we wanted something close, and this place was the closest. So we went there and it was horrible! It was a bit of a pain in the ass to get there, too! You have to go to the car park and walk to the left, then you have to go down the stairs and take the right turn, then you have to walk up the stairs to the left and take the left turn! Then you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant! We went for dinner, and I ordered a salad with chicken and pasta. I ordered a veal with vegetables and potatoes, and a chicken with vegetables. When I got the bill I was shocked! My bill was over 200, and I only ate 40 worth of food! It was really bad, and the waiters were rude! I would never go back! This restaurant is very very expensive. I would only recommend it to people who live close by.

Can you please tell me more about what happened? Perhaps I can help with resolving the issue or providing some suggestions for finding a good place to eat nearby.

I came here because we wanted some food after a long night and somewhere close! Was so hungry, I was about to pass out! I asked for some service! I was ignored, then I asked for a menu, I was ignored! Then I asked if we can seat ourselves and we got a smile and a nod! We sat down and waited for a while for a waiter! Then someone came with a menu! I asked for a menu for myself! She said I have to wait, we waited and waited! I was asking for some service! I saw the waitresses walking around and they just ignored us! Even if we tried to wave them down! Then we were finally served! I thought the food was good, nothing special, but my companions didn't enjoy the food! We were too hungry to care at this point! The waitress brought us the bill, I tried to hand it to my companions, and she didn't give it to them! And she just left! She didn't even ask if we wanted anything else! I didn't mind paying and tip, but the service was horrible! I just wanted to pay and leave as fast as I can! We walked out, and we heard the hostess saying someone was coming for our table! I thought it was funny! And the guy was surprised! I told him our experience and he said he would take care of it! I got his business card, I forgot his name, I was too hungry and tired! My companion said he would never go back, I don't think I will either! But I'll give it one more chance, if I don't like it, I'll never go back! Everything was good! The service, the food and the drinks! I would go again! Hmm, not impressed with the service! I was visiting my brother and we wanted some drinks and snacks! I ordered a grilled cheese and onion rings! The waitress didn't come with my drinks, so I asked her for it! Then she said she will come with it! I asked for a menu, she came with it and then we ordered! I waited for my food for a while, and I was about to ask for it, but then it came! The onion rings were really good! But the grilled cheese was burnt! I told the waitress and she said she would take it back! I waited for a while for my food, and it came! It was good this time! The waitress didn't come back! So I had to pay at the counter! I enjoyed the food, but not the service! I probably won't go back!"

We were staying at the venetian and we needed something quick. The first place that opened up to serve us, just as they did for everyone else in line...was closed!!! And it's not like its all new restaurants out there or anything...They need more places!! And you could see how soon everything got messed with..how late people waited until their meals finally arrived (after an hour) but then thought nothing of leaving without paying....dont get me wrong i wouldnt leave if im eating dinner which is why ive never left ever yet lol BUT THE FIRST TIME IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE TO SHOW OTHERS WHO WANNA EAT OUT IN CENTRAL FLORIDA!!!!"
Human,yelp-167,I was disappointed when I came here! I came here because we wanted some food after a long night and somewhere close! We were staying at the venetian and we also wanted something not too pricey as well! We came here and all their dishes were around 20 or so. I got the vodka pasta which was ok. Nothing great. The boyfriend got the pizza which was way too cheesy! I don't think I'd be returning to this place in the future.
LLAMA,yelp-168,I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25 just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this. Service was prompt but didn't really know what they were doing. I was there for brunch and it was mostly like bar food with a few breakfast items thrown in. The pancakes were dry. The eggs were overcooked. We ordered a salad and it was wilted. I know it was a Sunday and this place was packed but there's no reason for a salad to be wilted. The bar was half empty so no excuses.

My food came out and it was all cold and there were several little brown spots on it. The manager had to get up to check on us and asked us what was wrong. We were very unhappy and explained what happened. She gave us the manager's card and told us to give him a call if we had any further questions. I'll never be back. Definitely do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Posted by Kelly from Massachusetts on 2016-02-19 07:49:52 Served it to my husband and ate it. Worst tasting chinese food I've ever had. Definitely do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Posted by Kelly from Massachusetts on 2016-02-19 07:49:27 I'm not sure what happened but the food was not great. The fish was not fresh and there was an awful taste. I'm not sure if it was a bad batch of fish but I wouldn't go back. Posted by Alexandra from Westport, CT on 2016-02-19 07:48:47 The service was horrible. My waiter was super slow and when I asked for something, he would not tell me the price. I was annoyed and left without my order. I went back for my friend's birthday dinner, and the service was good. Posted by Roberta from New York, NY on 2016-02-19 07:48:15 We had 24 oz. of fish that was cooked very well. We had a great meal. Our waitress was excellent. The only issue was the waiter. I think he was overwhelmed and did not seem to be very efficient. He did not check in on us to see how we were doing, and did not know if we were still waiting for our check. Posted by melissa from brooklyn on 2016-02-19 07:48:01 This was our first time dining here and the food was good. The price was great and the service was quick. I will be back. Posted by Carol from North Carolina on 2016-02-19 07:47:48 I love Chinese food and this was one of the best places I have been to. I had the beef and the egg rolls were awesome. I also had the chicken and it was very good. The price was very good. Posted by Sandy from Illinois on 2016-02-19 07:47:33 Awful service and food.

We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter. When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress. The meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date. Do not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment. Eat here if you want to punish yourself."

Service I'm sorry to hear that you had a bad experience at the restaurant. As an AI language model, I don't have any way of knowing the specifics of your dining experience, but if you are looking for advice on how to handle the situation, I can suggest that you reach out to the restaurant's management to voice your concerns. This can help them improve their service and possibly prevent similar negative experiences for others in the future. Additionally, if you haven't already, you may want to consider leaving a constructive review on a website like Yelp to share your experience and help others make informed decisions when choosing where to eat."

This is located some distance away past security checkpoint (where you might expect it) but well worth finding if your plane arrives late or early since there are no other signs pointing toward this area once through doors into terminal building.)

LLAMA,yelp-170,"This review is solely for the food court. After shopping, my family wanted to grab some quick munchies to satisfy the hunger. We headed over and noticed they had some pretty good looking food options. My family and I decided to try the pizza. The pizza was made pretty fast, was hot and tasty. The employee was very friendly and nice. We ended up grabbing a cold drink as well. All of the food was priced great. We'll definitely be heading back to this food court. At the mall I work at we have a food court. This food court has several fast food chains like Subway and Taco Bell. The food is great and I love going there for lunch. It is a great place to go with your family and friends. They have a very good selection of foods to choose from. They have many different types of food for all different types of people. Everyone should be able to find something to eat. They have a variety of places like Pizza Hut, McDonalds and more. They are all great and delicious. It is a nice place to go for lunch or dinner."
Tsinghua,yelp-170,"This review is solely for the food court. After shopping, my family wanted to grab some quick munchies to satisfy the hunger. We headed over and noticed they had some familiar brands such as Taco Bell, Dairy Queen, etc. However, they also had some new names that we have not seen before. I was excited to see the items because I knew we could pick up a few quick meals. We walked around and browsed for a bit, but eventually decided on the food court. There was a large selection of food items that were available to order. I had to choose from 11 different options. The first item I ordered was the Mac N Cheese. I also chose a side item that I could choose from the options on the menu. I chose a side item called Potato Chips with Cheese. I was pleased with the price of the meal. The cost was only 1.49, which was really good. I really like the fact that you can also choose to add chips to your order. The meal was tasty. I enjoyed the taste of the mac and cheese. I really liked the side items as well. I thought they were delicious and the price was really good. I think you can get more for your money by eating in the store. This is an item that you can pick up and take home and enjoy later. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone. The next item I ordered was a cheeseburger from Wendy's. This is one of my favorite fast food restaurants. I ordered a medium cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mustard, ketchup, and a slice of American cheese. The price of this item was 2.49. I was really pleased with the price of this item. I really like the fact that I can get a medium cheeseburger for just 2.49. I really like the taste of the burger. It was a bit greasy, but it was tasty. I really liked the condiments on the burger. I really like the taste of the American cheese. The burger was a bit big, but it was tasty. I really enjoyed the taste of the burger. The cheeseburger was really good. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone. I would definitely go back to the food court. I would also order a different item than the burger. Overall, I would recommend this location. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick meal to eat while shopping. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants a tasty meal that is not too expensive. This location has really good options that you can pick up and eat at the store. This is a great option if you are looking for a quick bite to eat while shopping. I would also recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a fast and easy meal to eat at the store. I would also recommend this location to anyone who wants to save money on fast food."

Human,yelp-170,"This review is solely for the food court. After shopping, my family wanted to grab some quick munchies to satisfy the hunger. We headed over and noticed they had some dim sum. Great! Or so we thought. I stood staring at the cashier for a good 5 minutes, I was ready to just leave, but my dad was set on getting dim sum. After getting the cashier's attention by knocking on the glass, she finally took our order. We only wanted to get 2 pieces of sesame balls, 2 pieces of fried shrimp balls, and an order of shu mai. The lady told us that 1 order of shrimp balls comes with 3 pieces, so we took that. We then proceeded saying we wanted 2 PIECES of sesame balls, she started grabbing 3-4 and I stopped her saying no I only want 2 pieces she then starts saying TWO IS SIX. I then told her I'll just have 1 order since I figured one order is 3 pieces. She then gave a horrible attitude and THREW the sesame balls back into the tray. Overall Service: 0 stars After I ate the food it was sub par at best. the shu mai and sesame balls were fine, but the fried wonton chips on the shrimp balls were stale! Food: 3 stars I understand these Chinese places generally have bad service, but I would have rather had no service than this horrid service. I highly do not recommend eating anything at the food court. Just shop and move along folks."

We headed over and noticed they had some pretty good options. We ended up getting a couple of slices of pizza from the pizza place and some chicken tenders from the wing place. The pizza was pretty good, but the chicken tenders were a little dry. Overall, the food was decent but not great. The staff in the food court was friendly and helpful. They were quick to take our order and bring our food out. They also cleaned up our table after we were done eating. The atmosphere in the food court was pretty relaxed. There were a lot of people milling around, but it wasn't too crowded. There was also a lot of seating available, so we were able to find a table right away. Overall, I would say that the food court at the mall is a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat. The food is decent, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxed. However, the prices are a little high and the food is not always great. Here are some specific pros and cons of the food court at the mall: Pros:  Friendly staff  A variety of food options  Plenty of seating Cons:  Prices are a little high  Food is not always great  Can be crowded"

But on the visits I've made to the Amber Rose, I found the service to be slow and the food unremarkable. However, I understand that everyone's tastes and experiences can differ, and I would recommend trying the restaurant for yourself before forming a final opinion. Perhaps you will have a more positive experience than I did."

If you're anything like me you'd better start planning your weekend away as this one looks absolutely gorgeous! It's chilly here in Scotland but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy some sunshine while we're out enjoying the fresh air! I've been loving these days off because I'm able to take advantage of being free for lunch or dinner over break time (or both!). Which means you know what... More food photos coming soon!! A great place!! My sister lives down near Elizabeth and she brought us once when her hubby was always working late until midnight....and he went back again the next day!!! We had such a wonderful meal! She just loves The Prime Rib!!! This sounds fabulous and perfect weather too! We haven't seen any snow since December and it's lovely to see bright sunny days - although still cold sometimes:)"
LLAMA,yelp-171,"I'm continually unimpressed by the Amber Rose. I've not eaten there, and if I do I'll gladly update my review if it proves me wrong. But on the visits I've made, the place has been noisy and crowded, with a kind of unimaginative cafeteria style menu. The only thing that stands out is the fact that they're ""gay friendly."" I suppose that means there's a rainbow flag somewhere on the premises. The Amber Rose does have an interesting history, however. In its heyday, the Amber Rose was THE place for jazz in Indianapolis. The Jazz Kitchen was also a popular jazz club in Indianapolis, but the Amber Rose started things in 1954, with the Jazz Kitchen not coming along until 1984. The Amber Rose was a place where local musicians could hang out, and it was a popular place for international jazz stars to drop in. It was where Indiana natives Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, J.J. Johnson, and the Montgomery-Johnson Quintet played regularly. It was where James Brown and Aretha Franklin made surprise appearances, as did Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, George Benson, and Chet Atkins. From about 1954 until 1961, the Amber Rose was located at 205 N. Illinois Street. In 1961, the club moved to 1328 N. Illinois Street. In 1971, it moved to 716 N. Illinois Street, and in 1978 it moved again to 227 S. Illinois Street, where it remained until it closed in 2010. In 1967, the club changed hands from Pat Riley to the brothers Pat and Dave Belmont. Pat had been a fixture at the club for years, and the brothers decided to keep the club going. In 1971, the club was sold to Pat McCune, who kept the place going until 1983, when it was sold to Larry and Edie Baker. The Bakers ran the place until its demise in 2010. The Amber Rose was a place where, as one patron put it, ""You were likely to meet a member of the Rat Pack at any moment."" As a club owner, Pat Riley had some unusual rules. He wouldn't let the customers touch the instruments, and he wouldn't let his musicians sing. He was notorious for his fights with musicians over the bandstand. He was also notorious for his fights with his girlfriend, Patti Page. At one point, Page tried to shoot Riley, but she missed. Riley's girlfriend before Page was Miss Indiana, who won the Miss America title in 1955. Riley's successor as owner, Pat McCune, was no less a character. He was an ex-prize fighter, and he kept up a reputation as a scrapper. If the crowd got too rowdy, McCune would step down from the stage and take care of the troublemaker. The Amber Rose was also famous for its food. The original owner, Pat Riley, started out as a chef. In fact, the Amber Rose started out as a nightclub called the Onion Room, located at 205 N. Illinois Street. The Onion Room was a nightclub, but it was also a restaurant. It's menu was limited to steak, and there was only one salad. But it was a famous steak, and the club's reputation for food was still going strong when the Amber Rose closed in 2010. At some point in the 1970s, the Amber Rose became a gay bar. During the same time period, the Jazz Kitchen started up, and at some point the Amber Rose started having some trouble. By the 2000s, the Amber Rose was, well, a dump. The food was still good, but the place was dirty, the bathrooms were atrocious, and the place was noisy and crowded. The Amber Rose closed in 2010."
PaLM,yelp-171,"I'm continually unimpressed by the Amber Rose. I've not eaten there, and if I do I'll gladly update my review if it proves me wrong. But on the visits I've made I've found it to be an overpriced, underwhelming experience. The food is just not very good. It's bland and uninspired, and the portions are small. The service is also pretty bad. The servers are inattentive and rude, and they seem to be more interested in chatting with each other than taking care of their customers. Overall, I would not recommend the Amber Rose to anyone. There are much better restaurants in the area that offer better food, better service, and better value for your money."

But on the visits I've made, the food was nothing special and the service is far from stellar. And there are much better options within walking distance. I am happy to be wrong, but I think this is the only place in the area worth a try. So I'm not a fan of this place, but I'm not sure it's actually a place you can go and ""enjoy."" Parking is at a premium, so I'm not sure you can really expect the place to be a favorite with locals. I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. I ordered a carpaccio of beef, and a salad. The carpaccio was undercooked and not very flavorful. I would not recommend it. The salad was not very good either. I would not go back. This restaurant has been recommended to me many times, and I was very excited to try it out. I was very disappointed. I had the mushroom soup, which was quite mediocre. I tried to get a salad as an appetizer, but the waitress told me that they were out of the one I had ordered. I got a very bland salad instead, which was served cold. The service was slow, and there was not much of a selection of appetizers. I ordered the filet mignon, which was extremely dry and tasteless. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I was very disappointed. I've been to this restaurant a few times, and I really liked it. I just tried it again a few weeks ago and I was disappointed.

Perhaps it's the expensive drinks, the obnoxiously loud music, or the unfortunate fact that I don't have breasts and therefore won't be served at the bar in under 15 minutes. Maybe it's the combination of the above. As I said, perhaps the charm of this place is in the food and if I ever eat there, I'll certainly revisit my review if I'm proved wrong.

You don't have to do anything more than get on a campus and you will see it for yourself. It is not that the administration is stupid, it is that they are just over-protective and paranoid.

So I went to the deans office to ask why my classes were not getting a grade and why I was not being given a class schedule. He told me that the professor had been notified and I would get a grade. 2 weeks later, I get a letter from the Dean that says I need to be in class or I will be in violation of the attendance policy and my class grade will be F'd. I tried to appeal the grade to the professor and he gave me a reason why the grade should be F'd. I then sent a letter to the dean and said I would not come to class and the professor would have to make up the class since he would be missing the class due to my absence. I received a letter from the dean saying I was in violation of the attendance policy and that I would be in violation of my contract and could be suspended or expelled. I sent him another letter stating that I would not attend class or make up the class since I did not receive the grades. I then received another letter stating that I was in violation of the attendance policy and that my contract could be terminated. I was in class and the professor said that he was in violation of the attendance policy because he did not have the grade. I told him that the dean had already told me that I would get a grade and he was told that I would be in violation of the attendance policy and that I would be suspended or expelled. I then went to the Dean's office and told him that I would not be attending class. I was told that I would be in violation of the attendance policy and that I would be in violation of my contract and could be suspended or expelled. I was then given a copy of the attendance policy.

The staff is friendly though sometimes not as fast when you see them as some people think (some of us). The computer lab is basically a freezer that runs 12 hours everyday! My current job showcases this very well from our office manager who works away at her LLM program outside of college hours creating an online workspace where we can work together anywhere...she's fantastic! My advice: take advantage of all classes offered by University West. Some way or another you'll end up being able to take advantage of something that's reasonable in terms of time commitment - just make sure you're taking full advantage of what they're offering without giving yourself much more than you'd be willing to give someone else. And also don't be afraid to ask questions - there's always space for improvement, especially if you've never taken any kind of coursework before; it's completely OK for anyone to need help figuring out how things work; there's no shame whatsoever about asking for assistance."

Another option is to speak with the store manager and express your concerns. They may be able to address the issue and improve the customer service experience for future visits. Finally, you could also consider leaving a review on the store's website or social media platforms to provide feedback for the management team."

We have been to this City Farmers Supermarket three times since its opening last year on July 8. The first time we walked into it with our shopping list of 20 items. We scanned every item twice as if they had never seen us before! Then when we came out everything was tallied up twice also (twice!). Then at checkout each employee pounced upon us with questions so many that she could barely hear her own thoughts. She then started asking us why we didn't buy more because it's only 25 cash back per visit. While I've bought from other stores where you get 10 or 20 off but nothing quite like what they've offered here. They don't even give you your change...but ask me next time! I am extremely disappointed in how much money I'm paying extra for no apparent reason. Yes, they're fresh produce prices are very reasonable, which makes them great value at around 1-2 cheaper than their competitors. But that's still way too high. All the food has yet to be tested by third parties for cleanliness and safety issues Curbside pickup isn't readily available 6 days a week. And finally, while the front staff may appear friendly - please realize they aren't trained nutritionists nor do they know anyone who does. I'm sorry but these are all reasons why my grocery bill will increase dramatically during the summer months unless there's some sort of promotion going on soon. My daughter wanted the strawberries at a ridiculous price that I thought wasn't right. So i went to check out. A lady told me I must purchase ten cbs worth of fruit another woman said 2 lbs of apples etc.. Bought two bags of strawberry pics and gave her receipt. Forcing me to spend 14 bucks!!!! No could I just take those strawberry pictures home? This morning my family visited DICK'S Sporting Goods Chains. There were several people working behind a counter waiting for shoppers to come through. As a matter of fact within 15 minutes after getting downstairs, the doors opened wide and everyone left quickly leaving numerous empty seats."

Didnt want me to order dessert so I left early and returned a few mins later they said no it was taken off their menu there for x number of days now so if you ordered then dont come back This place has been one of my favorite places since I've lived here... But I'm disappointed when it's absolutely packed with people (not too crowded) and there's only two tables available: One for 4, one for 2.... Disappointed! Food was good; atmosphere was great, we had a table next to an open window which made us feel right at home. Service wasn't bad either - waiters were attentive and friendly. Went with friends last night after reading the reviews This place is beautifully decorated however the service was awful We waited over 30 minutes before our food even came out The server kept coming in asking what time would be perfect to bring our drinks and must have missed as he never brought them Even while waiting for our food he wouldn't stop talking trying to get more business from the other patrons However once our food arrived it was very disappointing It looked terrible and tasted horrible Price-wise we paid quite a bit more than normal places around town A lot better value elsewhere"
OpenAI,yelp-175,"The worst Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! The taste is ok, but not worth the price at all, neither the taste nor the amount. I'd rather go to Oriental Express or I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience at the Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's always frustrating when the price doesn't match the quality of the food. It's great that you have other options like Oriental Express, which you enjoy better. If you have any other restaurant recommendations, feel free to share them."

I'd rather go to Oriental Express or Jeannemarie's for less money and more quality They are really unprofessional too: they don't even bring you a fork after paying 10 per plate without asking anything why? And if it was me i would never pay that much again because of how bad this place tastes..."

I'd rather go to Oriental Express or any other fast food to get a moderate Chinese food with cheaper price. I've been here several times with friends, nothing impressive, and the last visit was the least favored. The Lamb Kebab is really, really just a few bite.... and it taste like fried, not roast on fire.... I would like to pay only half the price, or even less for it...The Xinjiang Style Chicken was not in so large amount as the menu says (serves two), and it is the least authentic Xinjiang Style Chicken I've ever got (and much worse than the one I cooked) I never try their Sushi, seems much better than it's Chinese."

Tsinghua,yelp-175,"The worst Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! The taste is ok, but not worth the price at all, neither the taste nor the amount. I'd rather go to Oriental Express or Panda Express. One thing that is disappointing is that there are no steamed vegetables on the menu, which I think is a must-have in any Chinese restaurant. Also, the salad they offer with every entree is bland and uninteresting. The restaurant is also very dirty, the floors are very sticky, and there are random crumbs on the tables. They're not in a bad location, but the quality is very poor. I recommend eating at Panda Express. March 12, 2015 So-so I would not say this is a very good restaurant. The food was bland and nothing special. The only thing that made it better was the waiters. They were very nice and did their best to make sure everything was okay. March 10, 2015 NOT A GOOD PLACE! I have been here twice now. The first time was horrible. We got a table and the service was terrible. The food was terrible. The next time we were served by the same people but they were horrible and rude. It was like they were not happy that they were serving us. The food was still terrible. We would not recommend this place to anyone. February 24, 2015 Worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to The food was so bad. I could barely finish my meal. I had a chicken soup and the soup was barely hot. The taste was awful. I was so disappointed. The staff was horrible. I was talking to the manager and he was rude. I will never go back. I hope they are as horrible at the other restaurants. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. February 16, 2015 In a nutshell: ""Terrible."""
BigScience,yelp-176,"We were in Vegas for the week for my daughter's wedding and wanted to try someplace different...not a chain, not on the strip, but great none the less....we found it at this small hotel. The Manager was fantastic - friendly, attentive and helpful. Our room had an amazing view of the city from our window with bathroom right next door! I thought our stay would end when we left town, so after looking back I'm still amazed that we didn't find out sooner about how wonderful this place is! Great place to have dinner or just hang around while visiting San Diego. My husband picked up Costa Rican food. It took him 15 min into his dining experience before he could speak fluently enough to order cocktails. The food here is quite good: traditional Mexican dishes like tamales (actually tastes better than they do at home), enchiladas etc.. Taste seemed very authentic. Service OK though slow due to high demand; take-out available also if you get tired waiting. Country Inn Suites by Radisson Denver West Lakewood offers a fitness center and business services such as meeting rooms. There are free self parking spots nearby, as well as valet service."

PaLM,yelp-176,"We were in Vegas for the week for my daughter's wedding and wanted to try someplace different. We didn't want to go to a chain, and we didn't want to go on the strip. We wanted to find a place that was great, but not too expensive. We found it! The restaurant was called ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" It was located in a small, unassuming building off the main drag. The inside was decorated in a Western theme, with lots of dark wood and leather. The menu was full of classic American dishes, done well. We started with the buffalo wings, which were some of the best we've ever had. For our main course, we had the steak and the ribs. The steak was cooked perfectly, and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. We finished our meal with the apple pie, which was homemade and delicious. The service was excellent. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. He made sure that we had everything we needed and that our meal was perfect. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. We felt like we were part of the family. We would highly recommend ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" to anyone looking for a great meal in Vegas. It's not on the strip, but it's worth the trip."

We went on a Monday night, and made reservations since there were going to be about 10 of us. We only had to wait about 10 min. after we got there, no problems at all. It isn't very big, but it's decorated wonderfully and it doesn't feel crowded at all, just right. One thing I loved is that the entire time we were there there was a 1 man mariachi playing a guitar and singing live. I don't know if he is there all the time or not, but I loved it...just added to the ambiance. We ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido con Chorizo in addition to the complimentary chips, salsa, and frijoles. Oh my goodness! It was the best, cheesiest, sausage-y goodness ever! Our table also ordered a pitcher of Cadillac Margs...the pitcher was more of a carafe, but the margs were delish! With 10 of us there were a variety of entrees ordered and everyone loved theirs. Mine was a cheese enchilada and chili relleno, both were delicious. Flan for dessert topped off the evening perfectly. When I'm in Vegas again I will definitely go back!"

I would highly recommend this place to anyone. We went with 3 couples and 20 kids. Great food and service. Not a bad tip either. The drinks were not cheap, but they were very good. The decor is a little dated, but not really noticeable. I would definitely go back. I had the deluxe sushi dinner, which was a lot of food. I have eaten at several different sushi places in Vegas, and this one is by far the best. The waitresses are very nice, and the service is quick and friendly. I would definitely go back and recommend it to others. I will be back. This was a last minute pick for dinner and I can honestly say it was the best sushi I have had in Vegas. The wait staff is friendly and professional and the food is amazing. We had the deluxe sushi dinner which came with several rolls, tempura and a dessert. It was well worth the money. The only negative was the bill which was a little higher than I would have liked. But I don't think I will ever go back to the original location."

We opted for an inside table and got seated promptly at 10:00 pm, which was great since we had been out all night! The service crew (ValerieSherry) greeted us with smiles upon arrival; they offered drinks right away but it took some time before anyone came around looking like he could take my order? The waiter finally showed up later after I asked twice if someone would come back over when there are customers waiting in line..... Anyway... once orders where taken that's about as far from what actually happened next - no one paid attention again until everyone has left half-way through their meals or so.. No check ever arrived either despite multiple requests throughout dinner.... It made me feel uneasy being waited on while other people ignored themselfs eating, watching TV etc.; you never knew who is going serve your food anymore because none of this seemed organized whatsoever......"

We had a wonderful server and our drinks came quickly. My husband and I both got the Mediterranean Latte and we loved it. It was a simple latte with a bit of cardamom syrup in it. For brunch, we both ordered the Bastilla which is chicken in a phyllo dough with a light egg wash and saffron, topped with cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. The chicken was tender and the cinnamon and sugar was a great touch. We also both got the chicken and waffles, which was a chicken thigh marinated in a house blend of spices, served with a Belgian waffle, bacon and a side of maple syrup. The chicken was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. I don't usually like chicken and waffles but this one was really good. The waffles were thick and crunchy.

The margarita was quite good. I enjoyed my Mexican food and the calamari was amazing. The only complaint we had was that it was a bit pricey. Our bill was 60.00 which included a house margarita. We will definitely return to Casbah to try their brunch menu. A couple of weeks ago, we stopped by New City Brewing Company to try their tasting room. We had heard great things about New City and we decided to check it out. We started our visit by sitting at the bar and drinking a pint of their newest brew, 'Shrek-a-Bock'. We were impressed with the beer and it's flavor. New City also had a variety of draught beers on tap. We decided to try their seasonal brew, 'Cherry Sour'. This was a very refreshing brew. We were very impressed with New City's selection of draught beers. We ended our visit by trying their newest Nitro beer, 'Cannonball Pale Ale'. This was another great beer and we were happy to try it on nitro. New City also has a variety of bottled beers on tap. We had a bottle of 'Old Milwaukee' which was quite good. New City has an indoor and outdoor seating area and there is a stage for live music. New City is a great place to hang out with friends. The best part of New City is that they are open 7 days a week. We had heard about 'Ladd's Texas Grill' for quite some time. We finally decided to give it a try. Ladd's is a steakhouse located in Houston, Texas. We were seated right away. We were both quite surprised to see that the restaurant was quite large and had a great atmosphere. We ordered a glass of house wine and then ordered a bottle of house red. We were not disappointed with the wine. The steaks were delicious and we were happy with our choice of steak. We will definitely be back to Ladd's to try their lunch and dinner menu.

They also offer a brunch cocktail menu with traditional favorites like mimosas and bloody marys, as well as unique options like their lavender lemonade or aperol spritz.

We had to wait for the door to be opened for us to get into the dining area. There were a couple of tables with empty seats and I was hoping that the other table had filled up, so we could sit down. However, the other table was a very young family with a baby. I felt like a bad mother for wanting to sit down, but we had been waiting so long. We sat down and the young family moved to another table, leaving us a seat. After a few minutes the other table filled up and we were asked if we wanted to wait for a table. I said no, and we went and sat in the dinig area. The food was okay, but there was not much of it. We had both eaten breakfast at 6:30 am and had not eaten lunch before coming here.

BigScience,yelp-179,"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that looked like an old garage with hardwood floors and chairs up against the walls-a booth near me had electric heaters (I know you don't need them if you're wearing long sleeve shirts) but I wanted to be comfortable. The food-though not particularly expensive-seemed high quality: bratwursts with melty cheese; warm dumplings stuffed with meaty mushrooms dipped in cream sauce; freshly baked bread rolls; corn on the cob drizzled in honey and butter...all served by friendly waitresses who didn't seem too busy! We started out our meal with four German sausages each with their own bun, they were delicious! After eating, we wandered over to the gift shop where I bought myself some nice glassware from Germany as well as several other souvenirs of my trip since this is one time I'd rather have something made here than bring back home-so it's all good Then we headed into the museum adjacent which has several rooms that display artifacts from various historic eras including Roman times. It also features some models built based upon actual finds found close-by - more on those later!! One thing I would say about looking through these displays-while items are interesting and historically valid-it's difficult to tell what makes them unique unless you've seen them before-often I've wondered why things look similar when I'm easy enough to see which ones aren't the same because the images are different-but then again-I'm no archaeologist or even a person who cares much about history so maybe that's just me... Anyway, after wandering around the exhibits and learning more about ancient Rome-and discovering how many other cultures influenced her-you can go outside to enjoy the view There's also an amphitheater-like area right behind where crowds gather on weekends during spring and summer-tennis courts equipped with lights-the facility doesn't appear to use its capacity always-so we opted to sit down for dinner nearby instead-since it felt a bit chilly inside the restaurant we got a table next to the windows overlooking the pond and barbecue pit-funny tables too-there was nothing fancy though and everything pretty basic-bacon wrapped chicken breast, salads and drinks."

Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner! The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot) - While our food wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time.

During my recent visit, I found myself paying attention because they do offer some specialty items on their menu. The first one I tried was a hot chocolate with marshmallows inside which came out great! It looked like delicious bread pudding too so I'll definitely try them again. My favorite item though was the cherry pie. It's the most authentic recipe they've ever made! The food there is amazing!

Our waiter was very nice but he could not give us any information and just let us wait. Then when he did finally tell us that our order had been sent to the kitchen we were told that they had run out of a specific item and could not fill our order. I did not understand this. We were told we would have to go to the next door to place our order. No explanation as to why this would be a problem. We got there and they were very nice and were able to make the same items we had asked for. They were very generous and I felt so much better about our experience. It was a shame that we had to wait so long and I feel like it was just the staffs way of making us feel unwelcome. The service was terrible. We waited over 30 minutes to be seated. We were then given a menu and were asked to wait another 15 minutes. When the waiter finally arrived, he took our order and we waited another 15 minutes. When the food came, the first course was barely warm and the meat was undercooked. The staff was unhelpful and the waiter didn't even try to rectify the problem. We will never eat here again. Would have never thought of coming back after our experience last time. The restaurant was closed when we got there so we ended up sitting outside. It was 100 degrees outside and we were told that we had to sit inside and wait for the restaurant to open. We went back inside after waiting for 20 minutes and the food was still not ready. We had to wait another 20 minutes for our food to arrive. The food was cold and barely edible. We had to wait an hour for our food. The restaurant is located in a nice location.

I ordered the wings and they were over cooked and hard to bite. The chicken was so dry. The burgers were dry and tasteless. We spent way too much money for lousy food and terrible service. We went here to eat and we had a party of 6. The service was terrible, the food was not that great and when we asked to talk to the manager we were told no. We were then told by the waitress that the manager was on break and he'd be back in 10 minutes. So we were willing to wait for him and he never came out. The waitress was rude and acted like she didn't care, she was texting on her phone and rolling her eyes at us. I will never go back to this place. The service was very slow and the food took 40 minutes to get to our table. When my group of 5 and I arrived to the place the waitress sat us down and took our order and went to the kitchen with no problem. But after a half hour we realized that the waitress forgot about us! We had to ask her for a refill. Then, when our food arrived we realized that 2 of our meals were wrong! One was missing the fries and the other was missing a topping. The waitress fixed it and then I asked to speak to the manager. The manager said that she was in the kitchen and will be out in 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, she came out to talk to me. I told her how rude the waitress was and the manager said that she will talk to her. I was glad to see that the manager took my complaint seriously. After that she apologized and offered us a free meal. After I told her thank you, she immediately went to the kitchen and didn't talk to me or my group after that! I gave her a 1 star rating for the service! We had dinner here Saturday night. We had a party of 5 and they put us in the back room away from everyone else. It took over 2 hours for our food to come out. When we asked the waitress if the food was coming out she said it would be a while longer. I am surprised that this place is still in business."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-180,"Had the absolute worst service here today. Straight from the Amy's Baking Co handbook. As a former regular we will never go back. Our entire table was flabbergasted at the horrendous treatment they received and it wasn't even busy which is why I have always been so loyal to this place before, as well overcooked food with minimal flavor just isn't worth 8-10 per entree (we were four). We had asked if there would be any substitutions or modifications that could possibly help in our situation of having very young children but nope! Nothing like my other experiences where you can order off menu items for special dietary needsrequests without much hassle...but not tonight!!! It didn "" it stop us though since both adults are gluten free along w some others on board who requested similar changes.....and two sides paid up front....no change allowed unless otherwise stated....so basically paying full price plus tip within 20 minutes upside down cause he refused anything else under new recipes......absolutely ridiculous!!!! You might want me banned too..........I almost fell outta chair when she said ""you""ll need more sauce..........""since after being told repeatedly about her lackluster efforts earlier...there should NOT BE ANY MORE SAUCE ON THAT DISH.....that means NO ONE ELSE WILL GET A SPLASH OF IT either!! WHY IS SHE SHOVING JUNK IN OUR MOUTHS? That rightfully belongs only saved him,as amy did nothing wrong ever during his visit except hire an atrocious manager! This restaurant has lost its way by hiring one now..its bad enough i see what goes into most dishes anyway...i don' take kindly knowing all those flavors belong solely mine. The resturant offers little value healthy choices such good quality meats produce etc ...while leaving behind meal options entirely unhealthy minus fresh greens literally thrown away once cooked made available upon request instead updating their signage accordingly................they do keep kids happy somehow??? Its clear these employees dont work together properly nor know how things operate because EVERYONE TELLED HIM AGAIN AND again "" She wont EVER get another lickin"" while changing ingredients mid dish time??????? But wait - let them make your plate then leave half untouched huh ""she says."" If anyone knows someone affiliated please report immediately - You may save lives!"""

It is a great way to unwind for a while after a morning of sightseeing and shopping. We were able to sample a variety of the dishes on the menu and they were all quite good. I particularly liked the grilled chicken served with mashed potatoes, green beans and a delicious sauce that tasted of fresh herbs. If you enjoy a good burger, you will not be disappointed with the classic one served at the pool bar. I am also partial to a good chicken sandwich and the one served here did not disappoint either. The burgers come with a side of fries and are satisfying enough. The only downside to this meal is that the fries are not very hot, but they are quite good. The dining area is small, but the service is always very attentive and friendly. It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so if you are not a guest of the hotel, it is still a nice place to have lunch."

The food is what surprised me. I got the salmon salad and shared the tuna three ways. My friend got the crab cake sliders and it was all delicious. The crab retained its texture and did not gum together like one which is made of all bread crumbs. The aioli is on the heavy side. The salmon was cooked to perfection. A beautiful medium with a nice warm center. It broke apart without flaking everywhere. The use of dressing was light and the flavors of the artichoke and other vegetables were present. The tuna three ways was okay. I am not a huge roll type of person, so I could do without it. The upside was that they did not skimp of the center. It was predominantly spicy tuna. The poke was decent. Nothing spectacular. The thick slices seared was the best of the offerings."

There is a restaurant on site where you have continental breakfast buffet for 15 per person which includes coffee or hot tea.

They have, by far, the best margaritas I have ever tasted...and I think the food is good too! My boyfriend complained about how small it was. And that he wanted a bigger parking lot to get more cars out there. But still amazing. Everytime we go here it's awesome but definitely need some services fixed. The kitchen needs new floors. Spaghetti sauce leaks into your pizza at least once per week with no way of fixing it on short notice The menu does not reflect its location. We were told they do burgers which are NOT listed on their menu. We asked for an example because my son likes them was charged extra money saying they did not offer any. Our neighbor next door who owns a restaurant offered us his choice - great customer service!! He ordered what we requested without hesitation!! Pretty sure we'd be happy if we could order anything from our local restaurants. Service is slow when you choose something off the dining room section as opposed to the main menu. It's only 1 side dish so don't expect much variety or quality items. Aside from those two issues - everything else has been outstanding!! This really isn't worth going even though the name says Pizza Ranch. Their pizzas suck, I've never had one that didn't turn into a clay pot after 30 minutes baking time (it came out dry). Not bad enough they treat you like crap while you're waiting for orders.. absolutely horrible experience overall"

Human,yelp-184,"I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than biopsy) performed, and discovered the dog had a sever infection of the prostate. The prostate had enlarged to twice the normal size. The infection was actually located on the outside of the prostate and could have spread and possibly killed the dog. I'm glad I didn't take Dr. Anderson's advice not to perform the biopsy (or similar test). It took immediate surgery and three weeks of antibiotics, but my dog it doing much better. The cost was less than I had expected. I'm glad I didn't waste any more time waiting for Dr. Anderson to return my phone calls and recommend treatment. I feel stupid for even waiting that long, but like many people noted on their reviews they trust Dr. Anderson. I was no different, so I waited.

It's hard especially since we're away during school holidays but we'll try to make sure that they are able to socialize with us by showing them pictures etc...... Just heard back from my vet who talked me into doing another blood test before sending them off back to him after I've seen everything else he's done. This morning I had extra blood drawn due to the amount of fluid being lost behind the eyes (which isn't surprising as it's such thin tissue) even though they've stopped losing fluid recently. So far 10mls have gone down the drain over the last 48 hours.. His first thought was something called ""lymphadenopathy induced hemophagocytic syndrome"" which sounds scary and maybe related to stressful pregnancy..but no idea what causes it exactly yet? He couldn't seem to find anything online either.. But anyway, hopefully means I'll be seeing someone different next week instead of whoever sent them here originally... We know skin can show signs of irritation from contact lenses (even fresh), so avoid wearing dark contacts under makeup, particularly where sun exposure may occur. (Avoid scratching.) If the reddened area becomes inflamed, discontinue use immediately. Rinse eye thoroughly with warm water to remove lens residue. Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms persist., Contact Lens Safety: Always wear protective glasses and goggles whenever working near tools, machinery, laser beams, or lasers. Wash hands often with soap and water (preferably alcohol based hand sanitizers).."

I am so glad that we took this route. It would have been nice to know if her kidney's were affected and I am still wondering if this should have been explored further.

PaLM,yelp-184,"I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than an x-ray) done on my dog, to check for any other possible issues. The ultra sound was clear and didn't show any other issues with the heart or other organs. The Vet did say that the fluid in the chest cavity was likely due to heart failure, and that there was nothing that could be done for this at this time. The Vet said that the best course of action was to keep my dog comfortable, and to provide him with pain medication and fluids as needed. He also said that we should start planning for what to do if his condition worsens. This was a very difficult conversation to have, but I know that it was necessary. I'm still trying to process everything that's happened, and I'm not sure how I'm going to cope if my dog's condition worsens. But I know that I need to stay strong for him, and to make sure that he's as comfortable as possible. I'm grateful for the support of my family and friends during this difficult time. They've been a great source of comfort and strength, and I don't know what I would do without them. I'm also grateful for the support of the online dog community. I've found a lot of helpful information and advice, and it's been comforting to know that I'm not alone in this.

Tsinghua,yelp-184,"I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than a CT scan) and my vet's initial impression was that the tumor was benign. He also said that he thought that the pain that I was describing was probably more than just my vet could diagnose. I'm glad that I didn't go to a surgeon and have my arm amputated. I did go to a plastic surgeon who is doing more research into my problem. The problem is that the tumor is so close to my humerus that if it was removed, the skin would be stretched over the tumor and it would probably detach and fall off. I'm also worried that I might have a neurological problem because of the location of the tumor. I'm hoping that it's benign and I'm just imagining the symptoms. If it is not benign, I'm thinking about having a repeat CT scan in 6 months to make sure that the tumor is not growing. 13 years old female pitbull mix (Pitbull Terrier) diagnosed with osteosarcoma, at the age of 12 years. Now 15 years old and has had a full recovery. She has been on prednisone for 3 years and is now going on her 3rd year of Ambroxol and Vit K injections. She was on Zometa for 2 months and has been off of it for 3 years. She had a scan every 3 months and every year she had a physical exam. All her scans have been clear and no evidence of disease. My veterinarian says that it is very unlikely that she will ever have a recurrence of the cancer. However, she did have a small tumor that was found after her last scan. She had it removed and it turned out to be a fibromyxoid sarcoma, which is a very rare type of cancer. It is possible that it could recur, but it is very unlikely. I have had a CT scan done 4 times and all were clear. I am in the same boat as you. My dog has been having pain in her front leg for the past few months. It seems to be getting worse. She can't jump, and seems to have trouble walking. She had a bone scan done last week, and the radiologist called me this morning to tell me that there was a 1 cm nodule on her humerus. I don't know what to think. My vet told me that there is a 50 chance that it's osteosarcoma, but I don't know how he can be so sure. He said that there are a few different types of cancer, and that if it is a malignant tumor, it will spread quickly. I know that it's going to be very hard to deal with. I just want to make sure that she has the best chance of survival. My dog had a bone scan done and they discovered a 1 cm mass on her humerus. They also did a CT scan and they found a mass in her pelvis. I don't know what to think. My vet is trying to get a second opinion, but I don't know what to do. The radiologist called me this morning to tell me that the mass in her pelvis is malignant, but that the mass on her humerus could be osteosarcoma. I am having a second opinion done, and I don't know what to do. I hope that you are able to get a second opinion done and that you are able to find out what type of cancer it is. If you can, I would try to find a veterinary oncologist that does a lot of work with sarcomas. I am having a CT scan done in 2 weeks and I'm hoping that the radiologist will tell me that it is not osteosarcoma. My vet says that the 1 cm nodule on her humerus could be osteosarcoma, but she is not sure. I hope that it is not. I just can't imagine having to go through this again. 13 years old female pitbull mix (Pitbull Terrier) diagnosed with osteosarcoma, at the age of 12 years. Now 15 years old and has had a full recovery. She has been on prednisone for 3 years and is now going on her 3rd year of Ambroxol and Vit K injections. She was on Zometa for 2 months and has been off of it for 3 years. She had a scan every 3 months and every year she had a physical exam. All her scans have been clear and no evidence of disease. My veterinarian says that it is very unlikely that she will ever have a recurrence of the cancer. However, she did have a small tumor that was found after her last scan. She had it removed and it turned out to be a fibromyxoid sarcoma, which is a very rare type of cancer."

I've eaten at this restaurant enough that it was hard for me to decide what my favourite meal would be... but now I'm taking a stab based on the following general categories: The meatloaf (toasted breaded patty with shredded cheddar cheese) - This is just one of those meals you can never go wrong! This place consistently reminds me why Buffalo Chicken Wings were created in the first place: They aren't like any other wings I've tried. They're crispy outside (like Buffalo chicken strips), yet soft inside. Incredibly tender and flavorful. It's not even close. I love their fried pickles; they're perfect as an appetizer or snack between two dinners! Don't forget about the sweet potato fries which come in both regular fries and Cajun seasoning fries. It's almost impossible to get these guys out of your mind when thinking about Texas BBQ restaurant dishes. The pulled pork sandwich comes from here every time we visit Dallasit's absolutely delicious. They offer many options for sandwiches so make sure you order something different each time: Classic beef brisket, scallion pancetta housemade green relish, smoked turkey breast, jalapeno peppers, sliced avocado, barbecue sauce chips, etc.... Enjoy their comfort foods like macaroni salad, baked beans with biscuits (my personal FAVORITE!) and corn casserole. Also check out the Fried Green Tomatoes because they ARE THE best!"

Must've been, since he ate the whole thing in about 5 minutes flat and he never eats much. The Man Candy is decadent, as it's served with Crown Royal Maple infused syrup. YUM!! I like that they have a lot of items on the menu other than bacon. I looooove bacon, so I'm in heaven when we eat there, but my daughter likes other things, so there's a good selection for her to choose from. The service is good to very good and the servers have always been friendly. We always sit at the bar so we can play the machines. We've never won anything significant so the machines seem to be a little tight, but each time our drinksbeers were comped.

Tsinghua,yelp-185,"We've been to Bacon Bar several times, and the food has always been very good and very consistent. My favorite item is the Bacon Burger; it's literally the BEST burger I've ever had. However, the food is NOT cheap. If you're on a budget, you'll probably want to skip this place. I have yet to find a place that can compete with their pizza. It's simply the best pizza in town, and you can tell that they use high quality ingredients. They have a different kind of crust that is very unique and tasty. They also do a killer ""pizza roulette"" which is a mix of 5 different toppings, with a choice of crust, cheese, and sauce. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who likes pizza. And if you're a fan of burgers, you'll love the Bacon Burger. We were driving past and were so surprised to see it was open. It was our first time trying it and we were really impressed. It is open 24 hours a day, so if you're looking for a late night snack or a quick bite to eat, this is the place for you. The place is tiny, but there's a good amount of seating. It is family owned and operated, so they really care about their customers and will give you a good deal. They also have an amazing ""pizza roulette"" that you can order by the piece. They have a great selection of drinks, too. We had the truffle fries and the bacon burger and they were both delicious. I would highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the area. Our waitress was very helpful and gave us good recommendations."

The tacos looked crappy. the burrito seemed nice enough. I enjoyed the marinade for the steak. Eh: Big blue moon beer was 7.50. A decent price knowing you are in an airport Bad: The margaritas are 15! 10 for the house one, that looked pretty weak. I sat at the bar, and I have to say I haven't been appalled by a workermanager in a long time. You know those managers that makes everyone worried and feel uncomfortable as an employee because God forbid you spill a beer or drop a napkin, he's gonna rip your face off! He would compainyellsuper sarcastic remarks to everyone working. And quite loud and openly. He ruined my mood. I really could have enjoyed a beer and decent quesadilla if it wasn't for him."

The jalapenos were over priced. The waitresses were over priced. And the drinks were over priced. It was 21.50 for a margarita. What the heck. I got sick the next day. I really thought I was gonna be sick. And the toilet in the bathroom was broken. It was a very small bathroom. And there was no curtain. So, no privacy. Lesson learned: Always have someplace to go. I guess that's what makes me happy. I can still find things to complain about. But it's not too bad. I am glad I have found a place to go. And I am glad I have my friends and family to keep me in check.

It sounds like a pretty nice place to visit, but I am glad that I don't have to go to that airport. I don't think I would want to go there. That sounds like a place I would not want to go. Thanks for sharing your experience. Hi Susan! I have been to Minneapolis several times. It is a nice city. The airport is not as bad as you describe. It is a bit small, but not too bad. And the restaurants there are really nice. I was going to try out that restaurant you recommended."

So far I've had great experiences at this establishment and hope they keep up the good work. My favorite items are the shrimp burrito bowl, for sure! More than anything else though, I'm glad my son brought me here on his first date with Kaylee. In fact, he's planning another trip because he loves it so much baby girl! Trying to find something new to eat out can get frustrating sometimes. We try to go somewhere different every time we visit our hometown. It wasn't until recently when after visiting two other places across town where neither had any food options that met my standards that we decided to come back again to Hickory Hill Brewery Restaurant Tasting Room which serves amazing food from start to finish and it's all made right there by talented chefscooks who make each dish unique using only locally sourced ingredients. What makes their food truly extraordinary? It's not quite what you should expect if you're expecting a standard American menu featuring burgers, cheeseburgers and chicken wings (although those might also appear on an occasional night), instead you'll experience cooking techniques such as: The entire menu features outstanding main course choices including seafood dishes like lobster bisque, avocado scallops and lobster roll with creamy mashed potatoes along with tender steaks served over pasta sauces, chili con carne, mac n cheese and more. We found Brought Down My Baby Chicken Wings the best wing recipe we've ever tried - they're absolutely delicious!. Ordering dessert andor drinks really isn't needed, even kids enjoy them while parents sit down and hangout together enjoying some time away from home without needing to worry about rushed service or unsatisfied hungry mouths waiting patiently outside the dining room. Food wise no complaints whatsoever! Was let down however when I called to express concern over how long it took to order a ground beef sandwich due to me demanding to speak to someone immediately rather then having to wait till 5:30pm to tell a random server ""I called earlier."" Not being used to sitting around waiting we requested a table by the window but upon arriving didn't see anyone except maybe 3 people seated next to us giving off a vibe like we're pretty much alone in the place.."

With two entrances into BWI you can see why many people get confused when they are going on their way to other places... It isn't really obvious which entrance leads directly from Mexico or if it does at all what exactly those doors lead out onto while being read by signs with words like ""International Concourse"" cars waiting outside etc.. In my opinion this needs some work as there seems no effort put towards making sure everyone has clear info about where each exit goers should be heading off too.- Bad -The sopes tasted pretty bland!

Tsinghua,yelp-187,"was this one of many casinos that didn't offer asian gaming opportunities? I forget. so many didn't. it didn't matter. when we were in Vegas, we went to a casino that was exclusively asian. i can't remember what it was called, but it was a big casino, with several stories. there was a big restaurant in the center of the casino, and a big asian section, and then a big gambling section. all the tables were 3000 bucks. i don't remember if it was an american casino, or an asian casino, but it was awesome. i think it was in Vegas, because i remember a casino in Santa Monica that was exclusively asian. we didn't go there because it was only for asians. it was a big casino, and a big restaurant, but it was for asians only. I remember that at one point, Slots used to have an area where you could go in and buy up to 10,000 worth of chips. I know it sounds ridiculous, but the action was actually pretty good. I went in there one time and bought a bunch of chips for 200, and was like, ""Okay, now I'm just going to sit there and wait for someone to bust out."" But I was the only person in there, so I just sat there for 45 minutes and watched the numbers go up and down and up and down, until someone busted out for 100,000. The next day I was talking to some guy who had bought 50,000 worth of chips and lost it all in one day. I was like, ""Dude, that was awesome!"" I was like, ""I just sat there and watched that 50,000 go down to 0 in one day."" I'm not kidding. It was so funny. I'm not sure if I've mentioned this before, but in the early days, I used to have a lot of conversations with my wife about whether or not we were going to have kids. I was very adamant that we were not going to have kids. I had a vasectomy years before we got married, and I was going to make sure that that never happened again. But, as I've mentioned, my wife and I decided that we were going to try for a baby, and then she got pregnant. When I first found out, I was so upset. I was like, ""We're not going to have kids. I don't want kids."" I was like, ""I'm not going to be a father. I don't want to be a father."" But, as I mentioned, my wife and I decided to try for a baby, and then she got pregnant. I was so excited. I was like, ""We're going to have a baby! We're going to have a baby!"" And then she got pregnant again. I was like, ""We're going to have a baby! We're going to have a baby!""

I left the office feeling like I had been treated like an inconvenience. The office itself was also very dirty and unkempt. There was trash on the floor and the furniture was old and worn.

I think that's about it for the good things On to the bad things - this place is freakin small man. like ridiculous for a place calling itself a nightclub. maybe it was the night I was there, about a week after their grand opening and on a Sunday, but it was so packed I don't think I even got on the actual dance floor till after 1am. there was a stupid amount of females in there compared to males. like other people have mentioned, the dress code was totally random. I saw a lady, not a girl, a grown ass lady in there with some dirty aerobic walking shoes like she had been to every point on the strip that day. craziness. the bathroom is outside of the club, so not only did I put off going until the very last moment, but once I got there I had to force myself to go back into the club - the damn casino, with its free drinks, was right there calling. and finally, maybe it's just me, but I never located this alleged patio outside area. and no I don't drink that much, its just extremely dark in there and they had one security guy in particular I didn't feel like going near. maybe that was the door outside, who knows. anyway, this would be a good place to start off a night, provided you were already in TI.

There wasn't even enough of what could pass off easily under one misdirected footstep being tripped over more times by your own feet when trying desperately avoid walking around barefooted - certainly NOT worth 50 plus per night!! A better idea would've been having space heaters available during those winter months instead doing nothing!!! You can hardly find anything else remotely near these prices elsewhere online either from HomeAway Booking etc....which makes me wonder where do ALL their customers go??? Maybe because IF YOU ARE READING THIS WE THANK THEM FOR IT!!!! We will probably never stay again anywhere close price wise regardless since our experience last time left us wanting way too badly: ("

I have been in a fair amount of therapy over my life and I wouldn't recommend them if it were up to me! The Main Street store has no elevator and it's ridiculous that they offer discounts for people who can't use an escalator or lift. Buying old furniture at Country Furniture was easy but buying new items from their showroom made things difficult because almost everything looked so good you could hardly tell what's wrong with it until you're there; not only do they charge more than other stores like Target (which had some nice stuff) but on top of that it's hard to negotiate prices exactly how much you want them when the salesperson knows most probably doesn't know anything about selling furniture!!!"

This is the kind of bar that is consistently good for beer and bbq. I've been to many a more ""trendy"" bar that is a complete train wreck, from my experience. ta17711771 I love this place. There are a lot of really great beers on tap. You can also get a pretty good beer to go if you're feeling really hipster. They also have good beer specials that you can find on their facebook page. The beer and food are both good. They do not have a liquor license, so they have to make beer that can't be served at bars that have liquor licenses. The menu has some pretty amazing barbecue, and some of the best wings I've had. The service is pretty good. The staff is friendly and the bartenders are always on their game. I recommend the food and beer. I'm not a hipster, but I am a geek, and geeks love nerdy places like this. grumpycanuck Haha..so true. I love this place, though. I have spent many a night here with my girlfriend. It's one of those places that people come to just to hang out, have a few drinks and enjoy the company of others. It's a hipster hipster bar that gets hip hipsters. It's a decent bar, with good food and a great beer selection. It's a bit out of the way, so you can come in on a whim, have a few beers and enjoy some friends. That's why it's hip. mschuetz They have a huge variety of beers on tap.

It is very nice and has a great atmosphere. However, recently they started using cheap microbrews. And, most importantly, their BBQ is not very good. Their wings and ribs are ok, but the BBQ is not as good as in other places. They also added a cocktail menu, which is very nice and well-priced, but doesn't seem to add much to the overall experience. codexon The best bar in the neighborhood. Not a lot of people know about it. Good selection of beer, food and live music. jsprogrammer This is a good bar. It has a great beer selection. There are a lot of really good beers on tap.

This is different from some bars where the bartender is behind a counter and you can't see the bar from the back of the room. drakenot My experience has been mixed, but the atmosphere is definitely very fun. 8ig8 Reminds me of the bars in New York, except with beer. brianmckenzie In my book, it's just another boring bar with a great beer selection."

BigScience,yelp-190,"It was a Wednesday night, the few was great but the bar itself was empty, only a few older ladies shaking on the dance floor, drinks were about 15 bucks and not bad. It's located in a mall near my parents house so it wasn't difficult to get there. I ordered some beer for me, I really didn't want anything strong because I'm still recovering from that drunk. So once again we started playing with ourselves at our own pace, she looked up at my cock when I pulled her against myself then asked what else can we do? Yup nothing breaks down better than real sensuality, piping hot sex is hard to beat. We found out that she wants more knowing this girl comes into town two nights before us. She sucks ass like no one has ever seen or done before! We place an order for pizza instead of going out to eat as its just too hot outside! My friend's mom bought him a Aston Martin DB9 Convertible last year. It cost him well over 300K. As far as i know he doesn't drive anymore. I felt sorry for his ex-wife though... He never seemed interested in having kids (or even trying) which left them with less money than if they had used their inheritance wisely... So i guess I'm wondering how many friends' moms are willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on their sons or daughters? You are welcome Lizzy! But don't tell anyone you saw these photos... This will be part of my Christmas presents If you see her driving around your neighborhood, stop by and say hi:).

Human,yelp-191,"Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and took their lumps knowing that the reward would be worth the effort. That place...is Bill's Gambling Saloon. It's not the Quad. The Quad, on the other hand, went another route: rename the venue, slowly renovate the casino portion of the building, and then sit on their asses while the rest of the building falls apart. My friends and I stayed at the Quad last week as we were looking for a cheap place to stay while on our Vegas trip. We stayed for five nights which is why we skimped on accommodations. I don't know how the new owners get away with calling this place anything except the Imperial Palace; the rooms are the same, the carpets are the same, the decor is the same...seriously, the only thing that makes it worth even entertaining the notion of staying is Hash House a-Go Go. That restaurant is the only clean part of the whole hotel. If the new ownership group had anyone with a brain left in that place they'd shut it down, do a real and full remodel, and open when the smell of cigarettes and urinal cakes finally dissipates. Seriously, the hotel is falling apart. I was weary of staying there but the price swayed me. I wish it hadn't. For the love of all that is both holy and unholy in this world, DON'T STAY HERE. Wait until the renovations are done, wait for people to review the renovations...and then wait until the gleam wears off to see if it's still worth it. You can go cheap almost anywhere on the strip at this point; the Flamingo is cheap and pretty and right next door. Plus, what asshole approved 6-to-5 payouts for Blackjack? Idiot."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-191,"Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and then waited for the hype to start building around them again... The only problem was: it took time! It takes some people forever just as much because of how long their memory is when compared with others - but also based on what's going in your life at any given moment (which I would even say has more impact). But sometimes there are things like this which can be used so effectively by many different gurus out here using these marketing techniques across multiple nichesmarkets yet all adding up together achieving one huge goal; driving consistent leads upwards from each person who uses those tactics until we get enough momentum where getting customers becomes easier faster over powered through sheer numbers alone without having every single product or service under direct control directly managed within hours.... if not days!!"
PaLM,yelp-191,"The casino closed its doors for the last time on a Friday night. The place was packed with people, all of them eager to get in one last gamble before the long-awaited renovations began. The casino had been in business for over 20 years, and it was a fixture in the community. It was a place where people came to relax, have fun, and maybe make a little money. The next morning, the construction crews moved in and began the work of transforming the casino into a new and improved version of itself. The old carpet was ripped up, the walls were repainted, and the slot machines were replaced with new and exciting models. The casino was closed for a year, and when it reopened, it was like a brand new place. The new casino was bigger and more luxurious than the old one. It had a state-of-the-art gaming floor, a beautiful new restaurant, and a luxurious spa. The casino also had a new name and a new logo. It was now called the ""Resort & Casino,"" and it was poised to become one of the most popular casinos in the country. The casino's rebranding was a huge success. The new name and logo gave the casino a fresh new image, and the renovations made it a more attractive destination for gamblers from all over the world. The casino quickly became one of the most profitable casinos in the country, and it helped to revitalize the local economy. The casino's success is a testament to the power of rebranding. By changing its name and image, the casino was able to attract a new clientele and generate more revenue. The casino's story is a reminder that even old businesses can be successful if they are willing to change with the times. Here are some of the key takeaways from the casino's story:  Rebranding can be a powerful tool for businesses that want to attract a new clientele or generate more revenue.  Rebranding can be done in a variety of ways, including changing the name, logo, marketing materials, and/or website.  Rebranding is not a quick fix, but it can be a worthwhile investment for businesses that are willing to put in the time and effort.  If you are considering rebranding your business, be sure to do your research and make sure that you have a clear plan in place. Rebranding is a big decision, but it can be a very rewarding one. If you are willing to put in the work, rebranding can help you to take your business to the next level."
BigScience,yelp-191,"Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and then the next day there was another announcement - this time it said something along the lines of ""We'll be closing again."" Well, I guess that's pretty much how I feel right now! When I try to think back on all my experiences here in Vegas lately...how would you describe them? Would anyone call what's going on with us as ""rebuilding"" or is it more like re-writing history? I'm not sure I've seen anything like our city over the past few weeks but...maybe it's just too soon for words yet! It took me some time before I really believed myself when someone told me we'd have mass shootings at numerous locations around town by June 30th (the date written upfront on every gun store door). But after seeing the headlines keep popping up since early May... Then life got real and regular citizens started taking their own lives one-by-one; no longer because of mental illnesses, drug addictions, domestic violence issues etc., anymore, these people were murdered simply because they were black andor gay. And if you're wondering why I'm writing about all this; well, among other things, let's face it: The world needs change. Maybe it's obvious from my perspective but sometimes I do wonder: How long can leaders continue ignoring the dire necessity for social justice? What happens when enough folks go into shock mode - i.e. so many suicide attempts, murders, bruised hearts AND souls, broken families relationships, physical emotional trauma....well, according to statistics, those are only expected numbers once you start getting closer to 30 unemployment rate..and guess who's doing an excellent job at keeping more Americans out of work......THIS PRESIDENT!! Even though he doesn't want it to look that way publicly - that his administration has made ""successes"" in certain areas while undermining others - Barack Obama knows exactly where America stands right now: It's dead. Dear fellow readers, friends and family members; don't worry if your political views aren't aligned 100 with mine. That's OK! Overall, however, I'd say our country is still reeling from the economic meltdown brought on via excessive debt levels which forced nearly 2 million people onto the streets of cities across North America looking for any part-time job possible. Two months ago, we had no idea what a pandemic represented. And ever since April 15th 2020 - which also happened to coincide with Mother Earth Day - we've been continuously updated with new information daily regarding COVID-19."
LLAMA,yelp-191,"Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and then had a big grand re-opening when they were done. A few weeks after they opened they found that the new sports book (where you can bet on sports) was losing more than it should be, so they hired a new sports book manager to come in and clean it up. He started looking at the numbers and found that the horse racing was losing 300 a week. So he eliminated the horse racing. Then he looked at the basketball games, and found that the sports book was losing 500 a week there. So he eliminated the basketball. By the time he was done, he had eliminated all the sports, so they just shut down the sports book. The new sports book manager didn't understand that a sports book is supposed to lose money. If it didn't lose money, people wouldn't want to bet on the games. When you're opening a new business, or a new branch of your business, you have to make sure that you know why you're doing it. You have to understand that things will not always be perfect, and you'll have to work to make them better. You can't just shut it down and give up. I was able to get my hands on a set of slides from this company's presentation at the grand re-opening. What I found was that their presentation was all about the ""wow"" factor. They talked about the big neon signs that would grab people's attention, and they talked about the spacious floor plan and the hundreds of slot machines. What they didn't talk about was what they were going to do to make their customers come back over and over again. So what did they do? They brought in a new CEO who told everyone to stop talking about what the business was going to be, and start talking about what the business was. He brought in a new management team that focused on the customers. And they were able to turn the business around and make it successful. So what's the point of all of this? The point is that you can't just do what everyone else is doing if you want to be successful. You have to do something better than everyone else. In our current economy, a lot of people are getting into business for themselves. And for a lot of them it's their first time. And the problem is that they see someone doing something that works, and they decide that they can do that too. And then they try to do exactly the same thing. So when someone's having success with a networking group, everyone else gets into networking. Or when someone's having success with a particular kind of marketing campaign, everyone else starts doing that same kind of marketing. You can't just copy what everyone else is doing. You have to find a way to stand out from the crowd. You have to find your own special way of doing business. So how do you do that? Well, you have to decide what you're good at. You have to find the thing that you do better than anyone else. And then you have to figure out how you can tie that to your business. When you have a special skill or talent that you can use to promote your business, you will always be able to stand out from the crowd."
OpenAI,yelp-191,"Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and then they went to work. The first thing they did was to take a hard look at the branding of the casino. They realized that the old branding was tired and outdated, and that they needed to create something fresh and new that would attract a younger, more dynamic crowd. They spent months working with branding experts and designers to come up with a new look and feel for the casino. They developed a new logo that was sleek and modern, with bold colors and dynamic graphics. They also revamped the interior of the casino, redesigning the gaming floors to be more open and inviting. Once the new branding and design were in place, they began marketing the casino aggressively. They launched social media campaigns, created eye-catching advertisements, and partnered with influencers and celebrities to promote the launch of the new casino. Finally, the day came when the doors of the new casino opened. People streamed in from all over the city and beyond, eager to see what this new and improved casino had to offer. And they were not disappointed. The new casino was a hit, attracting a younger, more diverse crowd than ever before. Thanks to its fresh branding and dynamic marketing, the casino was able to reinvent itself and become a major player in the gaming industry once again. It just goes to show how important branding and marketing are in any business, and how they can turn a failing enterprise into a thriving one."

They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and then reopened as a 15-story luxury hotel with 2000 rooms, a huge casino, a huge restaurant, and a sports bar. When they opened, they were offering a free dinner for every guest. How could you not go? When they opened, they were offering a free dinner for every guest. How could you not go? The people went, and when they went, they stayed. They bought lots of food, drinks, and entertainment. They stayed all night, and the next day they told all their friends. That's the power of a great offer. So, why don't you use it? What's Your ""WOW"" Offer? ""WOW"" stands for ""Wow, Oh, Wow!"" It's the initial burst of energy that gets your guests excited. I think of it as your ""wow factor."" What is it about your offer that makes it a ""WOW"" offer? What are you offering that is so different and exciting? Let's use the example of the massive hotel casino in Las Vegas that is going to be re-branded. They are going to offer guests a free meal. I know, I know. How could they not? Well, if you know me, you know I'm a foodie. I love good food. I want to eat good food. I want to eat good food that is prepared right, and I want to eat it in a place that is beautiful. I want to be entertained. The way they are going to do it is very interesting. It's going to be the food and beverage director who will be cooking the food and serving it to guests. You might be thinking, ""Oh, wow, that's really great, because it will be a chef cooking and serving the food. What's the catch?"" The catch is that he will be cooking it in the casino, right in front of the guests. He will be serving it on tables right in front of the guests. He will be making the food, cooking it right there in front of the guests, and then serving it to them. It's going to be a whole new experience. He will be serving it at the sports bar, where they have the live sports and the big screens, so he'll be able to serve a hot bowl of chili, or a warm bowl of soup, and have it ready and waiting for the guests. I think that is going to be a really big hit. It's going to be a huge ""WOW"" factor. It's going to make guests very excited. It's going to make guests come back. The Value of a ""WOW"" Offer The key to making your offer a ""WOW"" offer is to do it in a way that is unexpected. The value of a ""WOW"" offer is that it's unexpected. When you surprise people, you get them to react to you in a positive way. They'll come back for more. When you surprise people, you get them to react to you in a positive way. They'll come back for more. If you offer something different and unexpected, they will remember you and they will remember your offer. If you offer something different and unexpected, they will remember you and they will remember your offer. The more you surprise your guests, the more they'll remember you. The more you surprise your guests, the more they'll remember you. Think about this: If you want your guests to remember you, and remember your offer, the only way to do it is to surprise them. The only way to do it is to surprise them. If you don't do it, you're going to get nothing. How to Make a ""WOW"" Offer Surprise your guests with an offer that is so unexpected that it's going to make them go ""WOW!"" Here are a few tips on how to make a ""WOW"" offer: 1. Don't be predictable. 2. Surprise them. 3. Be fun. 4. Be fast. 5. Be personal. 6. Be real. 7. Be sincere. 8. Be creative. 9. Be bold. 10. Be unexpected. 11. Be different. 12. Be different. 13.

The people are nice, and the equipment is awesome. There are a couple of treadmills that have televisions built-in. You can even watch the news while you work out. There is also a large cardio room with an assortment of bikes, treadmills and ellipticals. The free weights are extensive, and the weight machines are new and clean. The aerobics classes are awesome, and I have tried them all. The best one is the Ab Attack. It's 25 minutes of pure torture, and I love it. The personal trainers are great, and the childcare is great, too. The Dowd YMCA is a great place to work out! Wow! This YMCA looks incredible. This is exactly what I'm looking for when I move to Charlotte next year. Any chance you can provide me with the contact information? I'd love to give the Dowd YMCA a call and learn more about it. Thank you!"
BigScience,yelp-192,"This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week and closes at 11 on weekends! It's great for people who have work schedules that are very flexible. That said, since this was my first time here, there were definitely some things I'd like to see changed: - The only available treadmill machines (and nothing else) had no weight adjustment knobs or resistance control - if you wanted more inclinedecline it required hitting up the counter. As someone without any prior experience running, I'm not sure what kind of impact these might have on me... - Some cardio equipment seemed old-fashionedoutdated compared to other gyms I've visited throughout California; maybe its just this one? The Dowd offers free weights as well as an abundance of exercise classes. There were also plenty of lockers provided along with showers changing rooms. Overall, the costs were affordable, the facilities nice, and, most importantly, it's close enough to downtown so it's attractive to tourists. As for space... while there's plenty of room around the floor where you're standing, crowded areas can get pretty uncomfortable when they fill-up quickly: ("

Human,yelp-192,"This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week, which while I would prefer 11, works for me. Also, going at non-peak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face- ain't no crowds at 9:30 pm! I generally stay in the Women's Fitness Center, which is a gym inside itself, but every now and then I'll make it upstairs. The desk staff is always friendly, and there are plenty of amenities to utilize. The one area I haven't ventured into yet are the group exercise, mainly for scheduling reasons, but I am eager to sneak into one one day."

Wonderful little place. Nice and cozy and clean. Nice selection of drinks. They have great tasting scotch. If you like scotch you will like this place. You will not be disappointed. Just try it. This is a great place for a small group. The prices are great and the atmosphere is perfect. The drinks are a little on the pricey side but I think that is because they are of good quality. The scotch selection is fantastic. My favorite is the whiskey and lemonade. Definitely a place to try out if you are looking for a place to have a good time. I went here last night with a friend who had never been here before. He ordered a whiskey and lemonade, and he was so happy with his drink that he ordered it again for me. We both agreed that it was the best drink we've ever had. The atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly. Highly recommended. Great place to meet friends and enjoy a good Scotch!

My husband's favorite meal is a veggie burger with a side of fries. I tried to replicate that feeling by pairing the burger with a delicious sweet potato fries recipe from Smitten Kitchen. This burger is a gem. It is not the meatiest burger you will ever eat. That is not the point. It is the most flavorful burger you will ever eat. It is light and fresh. It is the PERFECT summer burger. It is chocked full of fresh herbs, spices, and textures. It is super filling and packed with protein. I have served it to meat eaters who have never tried a veggie burger before and they LOVED it. I have also served it to the most ardent of veggie burger lovers and they have been blown away. It is a PERFECT, FLAVORFUL, VEGGIE BURGER. I could eat these burgers with a knife and fork. I would not even miss the bun! I will let you know when I figure out a way to make that happen. I will try the burgers in lettuce wraps or on a gluten-free bun next time. In a food processor, finely chop the walnuts. Add the remaining ingredients and process until well combined. It is not going to be completely smooth. That's okay. Form the mixture into burgers. I prefer to use a quarter cup of the mixture for each burger. This makes 6 burgers.

I didn't even think I'd get a good server because of the name of the restaurant. She was very nice and very friendly. I'll be back. What can I say? When the first time I tried this place I was not a fan. Now that I've tried it a few times I have to say that I am. The prices are good, the portions are good and the staff is very nice.

BigScience,yelp-195,"I couldn't wait to try this place yesterday, I was just craving something different. Darn, I wanted to like it so much but........................ I got one of their steak dishes and the portions were small. This is a good dish if you want an over-the-top comfort food experience without having to go quite out there with ingredients. The meat itself isn't that bad at all considering how cheap it's going for. It's not too dry or mushy either which means you're really getting more than you paid for here. The presentation alone makes this worthwhile however as well because they put everything on top of each other in preparation for your meal. It also has a nice savory base of sweet potatoes and carrots mixed together making them easy to eat while still being nutritious enough to satisfy hunger after. While my boyfriend thought this had some great flavors, he did find most everything to be bland. There wasn't anything spectacular about this dish except for maybe the brussel sprouts that he went crazy for (because he's nuts!) He even said that his favorite part was actually the garlic bread! Not sure why? One thing we can say though is that none of these items would ever leave our house again unless we're traveling somewhere far away from home and have no idea what else to get under the sun. Yes, we think you could make guacamole out of avocado slices freshly squeezed into the bowl instead since that's what they're doing inside there now anyway! We love our local restaurant chains everywhere around us so when we saw a review mentioning that McDonalds serves up fries made completely from veggies? We knew we'd need to check it out pretty soon... It's always cool seeing people push themselves creatively by mixing up foods you normally wouldn't mix... do you know any McDonald's stores near where you livework right now?

Human,yelp-195,"I couldn't wait to try this place yesterday, I was just craving something different. Darn, I wanted to like it so much but........................ I got one of their steak dishes which came with chimichurri sauce, white rice, spicey beans, french fries, plaintains and two fried eggs. I told them to skip the eggs and I was to get extra beans. Well I dont think I barely got one helping of beans and spicey they were not. The steak was over cooked, and couldn't taste any chimichurri. The plaintains were the only thing good, they were sweet, soft and fried just right."
LLAMA,yelp-196,"Bath and Body, they have been around for a very long time. I do not know how long this one had been here though. I have not been to one of their stores in a long time. I do not really use their products and my wife does not either. So the only time I would visit one is when I am getting someone a gift. I used to be a huge fan of their body wash. I would use it all the time. But it got to be a bit much. My skin would get too dry and it would get irritated. But I would use it a lot. I do not know why I got away from it. I think it was because I switched to a different brand that was a bit more gentle on my skin. I did try to get back into it a few times but I just did not have the same results as I did in the past. I am a huge fan of Axe body wash. I use the same body wash for a long time and I am very happy with it. I still have a small container of Bath and Body Works but I do not use it. It sits in my shower and looks pretty. My wife likes the lotions and body sprays from them. But she has not bought any in a while. She does like the scents though. The ones that she does buy are from Axe. She loves the cucumber melon. She used to use the peach but I think she is over that. I did have a gift card for one of these stores and I went to use it. I was very disappointed in the selection that they had. I ended up buying body sprays because they were the only things that were scented. I got a couple of different scents and they were fine. I am not really a big fan of body sprays but I like the smell that they have. I cannot remember the last time I wore one. I like the smell that they have but I do not like how they smell on me. I do not like how it feels on my body. I much rather use a cologne. I use Axe cologne and I love the smell of it. I have been using it for a long time and I have not used anything else since. It has a nice scent to it and I like the way it smells on me. I get compliments on it all the time and it makes me feel good. The next time I am in the market for cologne I will be buying Axe. 2019 Bath and Body Works. All Rights Reserved. Proudly Built with Startup WordPress Theme and WordPress."

Everything was super average. You know when you can tell if a dish is appetizing from the moment you see it? When I saw my chicken fried steak, I knew it was overfried, the quality of meat was NOT good, and the Cali omlette was simply too greasy and just overall Blah. The biscuits and gravy was hugeand just Not good. I can't even get into the specifics about the composition of the dish and the flavors, the meal was not worth the calories and grease. You'd think Vegas would have great bfast joints bc of the amount of hungover people in search for greasy hangover cures, but I was extremely disappointed here.

The staff is friendly and knowledgable. The beer selection is good and their wine selection is good too. They have a few hard to find beers. Overall I would recommend this place. If you're on the East side of Chicago and need a bottle of wine, or beer, or some wine accessories or a snack to go with your bottle of wine or beer this is the place. I went here with a group of friends and we ordered a case of wine to go. They told us that they didn't take credit cards and we couldn't pay cash. They were able to give us our case of wine for free though. They have a pretty big selection of wine. I got a bottle of merlot and it was pretty good. The prices are a little bit higher than what you would pay at a grocery store but it's still worth it. I got the merlot for 29.99 and the chardonnay for 24.99.

I did not expect this place to be that big and they had such a great collection of Alcoholic beverages. I went to the wine section and I was blown away by the selection of fine wines they had. I did not expect to see such a great collection of wines here. I found some of the finest wines at the best prices. I went to the liquor section and I saw a lot of great deals on liquor.

I tried to change my mortgage due to the high rates and they gave me a hard time. I have a mortgage with TD. I was very disappointed when I received a letter from them saying that my mortgage payment would be increasing by 7 . I tried to contact them to see if there is any way to avoid this, but they don't have a way to change it. I was given the reason that it is because of the changing rates. I would like to know why I am paying so much more when the mortgage rate has not increased by 7. My husband and I were referred to Michelle by a colleague of ours. We had a very good experience with her. We never felt pressured by her and she was always very accommodating to our schedule and made sure we understood everything we were signing. I was very impressed with the service and knowledge of the mortgage specialist. Everything went smoothly and I got exactly what I wanted. The branch manager at the Thornhill branch was very helpful and knowledgeable. I was very happy with the service and the rates I got. I wanted to change my mortgage due to the interest rate and my experience with TD was very disappointing. They kept me waiting for an hour and then did not really help me. They seemed to not really care and just wanted to get me out the door. The whole experience from start to finish was terrible. They took their time in getting back to me and I had to follow up all the time. Once I asked for a mortgage for a specific amount and they denied me. I increased the down payment to 60,000 and they still declined me. I tried to talk to a manager but got nowhere. I went to another bank and got the mortgage I needed. I am not sure if this is a problem at my branch or if TD is like this everywhere but the service I received was very poor. I would have to wait a long time for my banker and it seemed like she did not really care. My experience with TD has been great. I find the staff very friendly and helpful. I use the branch for both business and personal banking. I have a mortgage with TD. My experience has been good. I like the staff and they are always helpful. The service is good and I haven't had any problems with the mortgage. I was in a rush to get a mortgage and I did not have time to wait for a mortgage broker. I tried to get a mortgage with TD and the service I received was terrible. I would highly recommend not getting a mortgage with them. I was not happy with TD when I had a mortgage with them.

There are no drive thru windows, and the McDonald's employee stand outside of the store, ready to serve you."

We just ventured out here after a long day to grab some food. I ordered a 13 pounder with cheese, large fries, and a large coke. It came out quick and hot. I did not have to wait long. I was hungry. I started to dig in. The burger was awesome. The meat was tender and juicy and well seasoned. The fries were hot and fresh. I love the cajun seasoning they put on them. I put a little extra seasoning on them. I love the fresh taste of them. The coke was ice cold and not watered down. The place was clean and the staff were all very nice and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our trip to this McDonalds and we will come back again. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was clean. The food was hot and fresh. I love McDonalds."

We just ventured inside without the kids to take in some of these cool features. They are truly out of this world when it comes to burgers! For those who have never been here before (like me) I can assure you that they serve up nothing less than amazing food at an affordable price. For us moms I love how everything from the menu is so kid friendly but still tasty. I went all year around because the weather keeps changing. Here's what my family makes the most of: Made using fresh beef patties served hot in your choice of lettuce or tomato onions. Tossed with our signature homemade garlic seasoning. We recommend visiting during October since it's National Chili Cheese Month but really whenever you're hungry! This has always been one of our favorite lunches as well due to its size AND the fact they're dairy free. I'm not normally into meatless dishes or anything plant based....but I'm currently eating them ALL!! They look delicious!!! So if anyone ever asks ""what do you eat?"" I'll be happy to answer...a little bit of this and a little bit of that lol.. The best part about Everything But The Bagel is their portion sizes!!! Their bagels are huge which means you don't need many portions to get by If we think there aren't enough people asking me questions regarding automotive repairs then now there will be none left wondering anymore! A few days ago was the deadline for submitting articles for Automotive Tech News' April issue. So while I waited patiently for the editor to approve applications, I spoke briefly with some industry insiders via email. As expected, the topic was chatty - especially when conversations turned to PNC's recent announcement of 400 million in funding to help keep American workers employed when workplaces close down due to coronavirus."
PaLM,yelp-201,"My favorite place to get AYCE sushi is 808 Sushi. It's inside an old Italian restaurant that, when it was an Italian restaurant, looked really nice. But it's not going to win any awards for its decor now. The tables are small and cramped, and the chairs are uncomfortable. The lighting is dim and the walls are bare. But the sushi is great! The fish is fresh and the rolls are creative. The service is friendly and attentive. And the price is right. For $25 per person, you can eat as much sushi as you want. 808 Sushi is not the best sushi restaurant in town, but it's a great place to go for a casual meal with friends. The food is good, the service is good, and the price is right."

It's inside an old Italian restaurant that, when it was an Italian restaurant, looked really nice. 808 Sushi is not going to win any prizes for decor. I can't speak for the hygiene either. When I went the last time, I found a long piece of hair in my sashimi. I was really grossed out. But, I gave the place another chance and went again. The sushi is good, and I love the baked mussels. My favorite is the deep fried soft shell crab, though. You can also order Korean barbeque, which is also very good. It's a KoreanJapanese mix. I wouldn't say it's authentic Japanese, but it's pretty good. Labels: cheap, sushi Whenever I go to Rockville, I always try to stop at China Bistro for lunch. China Bistro is a hole in the wall. The inside is bright and clean. The food is delicious. I always get the wonton soup and pork fried rice. The wonton soup has a nice flavor. The wontons are a bit chewy, but I don't mind because the flavor is good. The pork fried rice is good, too. It has a nice flavor, and it's not too greasy. I like the fact that they put the brown gravy on the side, so you can decide how much you want to use. It's very reasonably priced, too. I think the most expensive thing on the menu is 6.95. The food is cooked fresh, and it's very fast. It's a good place to stop for a quick bite to eat. Labels: cheap, chinese Fiorella's is a fun place to go for Italian food. The restaurant is really cute, and the decor is nice. The food is not all that great, though. I've tried a few things on the menu. The best I've had is the chicken Florentine. The chicken was tender, and the sauce was good. I also got the penne, which was okay. The penne was way overcooked, and the sauce was pretty bland. The bread was delicious. I like the fact that they serve you a lot of bread. It's freshly baked, and it's warm and crispy. The service is okay. The staff is friendly, but I was seated at the front, and I had to listen to the wait staff talking about their personal lives. That was a bit weird. The restaurant is kind of noisy, too. All in all, Fiorella's is a good choice, if you are in the area. Labels: italian, nice, pasta, Rockville I went to the Taste of Bethesda a couple of weeks ago. My husband and I were amazed at the huge turnout for this event. We parked about a mile away, and walked to the street, where the food was. We started with the Indian food, which was delicious. I had the chicken tikka, and my husband had the vegetable samosa. Then, we went to the Thai place. I had the pad thai, which was okay. I think they put too much sauce in it, though. It was very saucy, and it didn't have much flavor. Then, we went to the restaurant we were most excited to try - Coastal Flats. This restaurant just opened up in Rockville. We were excited to try their food, because it looked so good. The food was okay. The wait was way too long, though. We stood in line for about 20 minutes, and we watched as other people got their food, and we didn't. When we finally got our food, we realized it wasn't worth the wait. It was really small portions, and it wasn't that good. I had the chicken quesadilla, and my husband had the shrimp tacos. They were both just okay. I was really disappointed. I thought the food was going to be a lot better. I was glad I didn't wait that long in line for a regular meal. After that, we went to the Italian food, and then we left. We didn't get to try all of the food, because some of it was meat, and we don't eat meat. Overall, it was a fun event. I don't know if we'll go again, though. The food was just okay, and the lines were too long. Labels: bethesda, festival I"

It's inside an old Italian restaurant that, when it was an Italian restaurant, looked really nice. 808 Sushi is not going to win any awards for style or decor but their quality of food and service are great. The owner makes sure the counter staff knows how much each order weighs before you go through cash registers. That helps with accuracy. Prices start at 5 bucks a plate if your ordering from the menu; it can cost upwards of 12-15 depending on what you're ordering, but I've never seen anything over 20 in my life so don't worry about getting ripped off here. If you want something special like crab rolls (or whatever), they will make them out to you by weight. This place has two locations: one called ""Tokyo"" near East Village's Oxford Street entrance which I think everyone should visit because it's part of their history, and then there is another location in Brooklyn Heights just outside Canal Park Mall called ""Captain Cook's Chops East."" I met this guy named Donny McFarland while working as a waiter back in 2003. He used to be one half of Captain Cooks Chop House Subs, a sub shop along Broadway West where we had our own kitchenette providing meals to customers who couldn't eat main dishes there. (Captain cook's was owned by Gordon Ramsay!) But he left behind him his old chops house name in hopes some day someone would reopen it since nothing seemed to budge after the smash-and-grab theft of 2005. It turns out the real estate company bought the properties and renovated everything into condos. They opened up a new location in July 2010 under the same name-and it's absolutely beautiful! The original inside space looks very different now than it did decades ago."

I would try Verde again, but I would not eat there again. The salad was really good. It was a pretty big salad and they put a good amount of lettuce in it. The beans were really good, too. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that there was no dressing on the side, and I don't really like vinaigrettes, so I couldn't really eat that. But the salad itself was really good. I'd recommend trying it if you're looking for a salad. The only thing I didn't like was that the house salad dressing was too strong for me. It was a good salad, but I just wasn't a fan of the dressing. The steak was very good. It was well cooked and the fries were also good. Overall, the meal was very good. I'd definitely recommend it.

The crew even tried to steer us away from buying fresh ingredients and suggested using frozen ones instead; we're not going to let them dictate what goes in our plates here. (We do eat meat and there is no veggie option with their signature burgers.) However, I did order my 2nd beer for free because it was the first time I'd ever been served this way.

I went to Verde to celebrate Earth Day. I thought that it would be a great place to eat lunch on Earth Day. I knew that they were a vegetarian restaurant, but I didn't realize that there wasn't much vegetarian food on the menu. I'm not a vegan, but I eat a lot of vegetarian food. I just happen to like cheese and eggs. Anyway, I ordered the Mexican plate. It came with a salad, guacamole, refried beans, rice, and tortillas. I asked for a side of cheese and sour cream to add to my tortillas. I thought that maybe I could make my own version of nachos. I didn't get any sour cream, but I did get the cheese. When the bee landed on my food, I asked the waiter to take it away. He said that they would bring me a new plate. The bee returned, and landed on my new plate. At that point, I was over it! The salad was fine. It had a lot of purple cabbage in it. The guacamole was very good. The refried beans were also good. The rice was good. They gave me way too much rice. I'm not sure why they serve so much rice at one time. I had plenty of cheese for my tortillas. The tortillas were small, but tasted good. The service was okay. Our waiter forgot to bring the sour cream, and when I asked for more tortillas, he didn't bring those either. The manager came over and asked if we were okay. I said that I was okay, but I was just a little disappointed that they didn't have any vegetarian food on the menu. He said that I could always order a salad. I guess that I'm not a vegetarian, because I don't think that I would go to a restaurant and just order a salad. I decided to leave the patio. I was really bothered by the bee, so I decided to sit inside. When I got up to go inside, the bee was still there. I'm not sure why they don't kill the bee. I had to ask the waiter to take the bee away. When I was eating inside, I heard the waiter tell someone else that they don't make nachos. I guess that I wasn't the only person who had that idea. They should just make them available on the menu. The pink building looks like a nice place to eat, but I don't think that I will be going back.

LLAMA,yelp-203,"Same situation. I called yesterday to schedule an appointment. I made sure to ask if the rental was definitely available and I was assured it was. I made the appointment. I show up today. Turns out there was a miscommunication and someone else has the car already. There was no problem rescheduling the appointment. But they didn't want to get another car because they had to close soon and they wanted me to reschedule my appointment and come back in the next two weeks. Not acceptable. They had no car for me today. I was willing to take a different car. My wife was willing to take a different car. But the manager said no. I want to buy a new car. I want to buy a Volvo. But this is the second time in a month where Volvo has really disappointed me. I am seriously considering a different brand. Unlike other reviews, I did not have the best experience at this dealership. I went in to test drive an XC40 and spoke with a salesman who was nice enough, but it was clear that he had not driven the XC40 before. So he could not answer any questions about the car. He offered to let me drive the car by myself. I did this, but I wanted to be sure that I could test out the full capabilities of the car, so I wanted to ask a few questions about that. I asked if the salesman could join me on the test drive. He agreed, but it was clear that he was not happy to do this. He refused to use the radio, which was an important part of my test drive. He did not want to take me on the highway because he did not want to go on the highway. He did not want to take me on any bumpy roads because he did not want to drive on those. He was also not willing to answer any questions about the car. I was in the car for less than 20 minutes, but I felt like it was a waste of my time because I didn't really get to test out the car. I then went to the Volvo dealership in Rockville and I had a much better experience there. We have an XC90 2016 and were interested in an XC60. After checking inventory with CarGurus, we noticed there were three of the particular vehicle we were interested in at this dealership. We went in and the first salesperson that came to us was not the best. He did not seem very interested in helping us. We test drove the vehicle we were interested in and they gave us a price. When we got home, we compared that price to the price we had received from another dealership via CarGurus. The other dealership was about 6000 less than the price we were offered at DARCARS. We ended up purchasing from the other dealership. Service advisor was very polite and professional. She made sure to explain everything thoroughly and answered all of my questions. I am very happy with the service experience. I was interested in buying a new Volvo XC90, and the dealership had two of the trims that I was interested in. I went to the dealership on the Saturday and was met by a young man named Brian. He was extremely friendly and very helpful. He answered all of my questions and did not make me feel pressured at all. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicles and was able to show me the differences between the two trims I was looking at. The whole process took about an hour and a half and I was able to walk out with a new car. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for a new or used car. Excellent service! Got my car in and out as expected."

PaLM,yelp-203,"Same situation. I called yesterday to schedule an appointment. I made sure to ask if the rental was definitely available and was assured it was. I made the appointment for this morning, drove all the way there, and they told me they had just rented it out to someone else. They said they had forgotten to take it off the website. I was so angry I could have cried. I wasted my time and gas, and now I have to start the search all over again."

The crappy Home Depot faucet lasted less than 4 years and was poorly designed. But the good folks at AAA fixed it with a lifetime warranty faucet and it is working like a charm. I would recommend AAA to anyone! Had to call AAA Plumbing for a backed up toilet on a Saturday morning. Called their office and spoke to a person. They said they would call me back. I received a call in about 10 minutes and was able to get an appointment for a technician to come out. He arrived within the two hour time frame and went to work right away. He had to use a snake to clear the clog but he was able to do it. Took him about 30 minutes total. It turned out to be roots from an old tree that was planted to close to the house. The technician was very pleasant and knowledgeable. I would definitely use them again. Thank you for the review, we are glad to hear we could help you out!"

Eleuther-AI,yelp-205,"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally tried one, and were not impressed in quality or taste - so much that my wife declared she would never eat there again! I've been following this thread since those initial days when discussions of how best they could improve themselves seemed like a good idea...but lately most posts are just people complaining about bad service because things aren't as ""friendly"" anymore- either from managementstaff attitude changes etc., OR is someone having an off day? In any case: THANKS TO ALL WHO HAVE CONTINUED WITH THIS FORUM EVEN WHEN IT WAS COMPLETELY OFF TOPIC IN THE PAST!!! The other night was apparently ugly southwestern windy weather after our anniversary dinner on Sunday evening out near Red Rocks where everthing went well except getting back home....ALL OF OUR CAMERAS AND PHONES FAILING DUE AT LEAST PARTLY (!?) BUT MOST LIKLEY BECAUSE WE WERE STANDing UP TOO LONG OUTSIDE?!??? That's why you CAN't have nice stuff sometimesit can fail us unexpectedly!! At least no walking up steps needed:) No complaint here though we had fun despite all odds but will ALWAYS go inside wagering if possible now instead"

Human,yelp-205,"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally gave it a try and wished we'd continued to avoid it. We ordered what I consider to be a 2-topping pizza consisting of mushrooms (all over), half pepperoni and half sausage. We were immediately informed that this is a 3-topping pizza and would be charged accordingly. I have never heard of this - is this the new norm? It's always been my experience that two half toppings count as one for pricing. How was the finished product? The crust is extremely thin, soggy and lacking flavor; I am usually one to eat the crust edges, but this was so bland, there was no point. The cheese is exceptionally greasy and it didn't go to the edge of the pie. The mushrooms were sparse and carelessly strewn about; however, there was a fair amount of both the pepperoni and sausage. And oregano? It was treated more like a topping than a spice! Why is it many pizza joints think that good pizza should consist of large amounts of oregano? Oregano should enhance the flavor, not BE the flavor! Now, I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible, in my opinion, and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off. What can I say that was good? The pizza wasn't outrageously priced (compared to other pizza places), it was ready fairly quickly, and they have good quality napkins."

Tsinghua,yelp-205,"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally gave it a try recently and had our first experience with this chain. We had a small ""Crustwich"" (two thin crust pizzas with cheese and a choice of toppings) and a large ""Pizza Slice"" (a small pizza topped with a cheese sauce and a couple of other toppings). The pizza was actually pretty good, but the crust was soggy. I guess they are using the same crust that the Metro uses, which is just a single crust. Slices has no bad pizza, but it's really not my favorite pizza, either. Slices is on the Boulder Station Casino's menu; you can order it from the casino's cashier or order it over the phone. The main difference between Slices and the Metro is that Slices has an extra cheese sauce option, but you pay an extra 2.00 for that. I don't know what the extra cheese sauce is made of, but it's definitely a lot more expensive than the cheese sauce on the Metro. It's also cheaper than the pizza at the Boulder Station Casino, which I've had at least twice in the past. Slices also has a pizza salad. I haven't tried it, but I've heard good things about it. It's not bad, but I think it's a bit overpriced. You can also get the salad without the crust and with a side of chips and salsa for only 1.50. You can get the salad without the crust and with a side of chips and salsa for only 1.50. We've also tried the grilled cheese sandwiches at Slices. They're good, but they're definitely more expensive than the cheese sandwiches at the Boulder Station Casino. I think they are only 2.50, but I think the cheese sandwiches are only 2.00. The grilled cheese sandwiches are a bit better than the cheese sandwiches at the Boulder Station Casino, but they're definitely more expensive. You can also get a baked potato with a side of chips and salsa for 1.50. Slices is at 4101 S. Colorado Blvd. in the mall between the Rainbow Room and Flair. I'm sure they also have locations in Denver and other areas. The Boulder Station Casino (casino) is now open and ready for business. I'm not sure if they are open for dinner yet, but they are open for lunch. They are open 10:00 am to 10:00 pm daily. The casino is located at 4101 S. Colorado Blvd. in the mall between the Rainbow Room and Flair. They are also open on the weekends. I'm sure they will be open on the weekdays as well, but I haven't heard anything about it.

LLAMA,yelp-205,"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally tried it last week. The dining room is a small space with a small counter for ordering, and a few tables inside. The back wall is a display of various sodas, including a nice variety of fountain drinks. The menu is extensive. They have the usual pizzas, but they have a lot of different specialty pizzas, salads, calzones, desserts, and various other pizza-related items. I decided to order a few slices and a salad. The salad came first. The Caesar salad has mixed greens, romaine, parmesan, and croutons. The croutons were actually cubes of bread, which I like, and they were toasted to a golden brown. The salad was dressed in a creamy Caesar dressing, but it wasn't too overpowering. The salad was also topped with some shaved parmesan, which was a nice touch. The slices I ordered were the White Slice and the BBQ Chicken. The White Slice was topped with olive oil, garlic, mozzarella, ricotta, and oregano. The dough was very thin and soft, and the pizza was full of flavor. The garlic and oregano was very nice. The ricotta and mozzarella were very good. The pizza was also topped with some crispy onions. They were really good. The BBQ Chicken was topped with barbecue sauce, chicken, red onion, cilantro, and mozzarella. Again, the dough was very good, the pizza was very flavorful, and the toppings were very good. It was a little messy, but the chicken was excellent. The pizza was also topped with some crispy onions. The onions, barbecue sauce, and cilantro were a great combination. The service was very good. Our food arrived very quickly, and the server was very friendly and attentive. Overall, I thought Slices was pretty good. It was a little pricey, but the food was very good. I liked the flavors, and the crust was very good. The service was good, and the dining room was comfortable and inviting. After eating there, we walked through the casino and I took a few pictures. Boulder Station Casino, Hotel, and Bowling Alley is one of the Station Casino properties. It's located about five miles east of the Las Vegas Strip. The casino has been around for about twenty years, and it's a little dated, but they have been making some renovations and updates to the hotel and casino. The casino has several restaurants, and a bowling alley. The casino is very smoky, as most Station Casinos tend to be. Boulder Station is very similar to other Station Casino properties, such as Sunset Station, Santa Fe Station, Texas Station, and Fiesta Henderson. It's a decent casino, and if you're in the area, it's worth a visit.

BigScience,yelp-205,"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally had our last slice left when one night we were having dinner at Bohemia and decided that if they only served 3 slices, then they should serve them in 6-inch chunks. Their bread was chewy on the inside but crisp outside so you couldn't just bite into one piece of bread - so it's what I do now whenever there's lots leftover: make some sandwiches! We didn't go back after this occasion though because we felt like it'd been pretty convenient not needing to get off our bikes or lugging bags all over town. I never got around to writing about my visit to Burger King until June 2016, which is sort of out of order as I've recounted other things first in each post but I'm still going by the original sequence here anyway.

Having never been to a Burbank buffalo joint, it was my first time at The Buffalo Tavern. It turned out to be amazing! The place was packed with people waiting for tables so we had to wait some time but that just added more excitement! I ordered regular chicken fingers which were surprisingly pretty great! They seemed thick enough as well and they didn't have any of the greasy feel you get in other places. They also offer a number of affordable appetizers such as Waffle Fries, Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Eating Vinaigrette and I'm sure there are others I missed. On Monday afternoon, the day after heading home from Burbank Buffet (which I'll discuss later), we headed over to Burbank Yardhouse where we enjoyed a nice lunch before returning back our cars. Located right next door to Borough Market on West Broadway, this Italian restaurant is open 7 days per week from 10:30AM until 9:30PM and offers an array of delicious pasta dishes to choose from and local wine listings. Our meal started off with something simple - a starter salad featuring red cabbage, arugula leaves, cherry tomatoes, olives, carrots, hard boiled eggs caramelized walnuts, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The vegetables tasted like they came straight from the garden while everything else harmoniously complemented each other's flavors. My husband requested for his entree portions to be bigger because he loves big meaty bites! He chose the House Special Meatballs consisting of: tender beef cooked with spaghetti sauce, sauteed mushrooms, peppers, garlic cloves, bell pepper slices and mozzarella cheese. We both loved how much flavor these burger patties had thanks to the use of seasonings including paprika powder, rosemary, sage, thyme, parsley and chilli powder. The mayo used here wasn't watery nor did it have any oily taste though we do find the overall texture less than crunchy compared to some well known fast-food brands. There were only two pieces of fries available: either small potato chips served with ketchup mustard or large french fry wedges offered alongside house-made blueberry jam. My personal preference for whatever accompaniment comes along with your main dish will depend primarily upon what kind of person I am - if you're not into sauces then don't bother buying them since they won't go very far anyway For dessert, we opted to order a chocolate fondue pudding served with whipped cream and cherries followed by tiramisu cheesecake prepared using light sour cream instead of heavy cream. Both desserts tasted heavenly although the chocolates went cold quickly and could've benefited from being warmed up slightly longer before serving. Overall, this Italian eatery has a lot going for it - inviting interior decor, welcoming staff who speak perfect English, reasonable prices and ample parking options all make it worthwhile giving a try when visiting New York City during winter months. Packages include two breakfast sandwiches, one soup, one baked goods item, tea, coffee, juice and bottled water"

They have a 40 dollar minimum spend for most wings. I usually have a 1000 deposit on my card for the purchase. Sometimes you can find deals like the 20 wing night. Also a freebie for any 50 spend on your card. This was the best wing I have ever had! They have the Atomic wings, chicken fried wings, a different cheese dip and chicken wings, and then the baby wings. I have had the baby wings and they are the best. It is so good. I just got back from there and the place was packed. You have to wait about 20 minutes to get a table. I got there around 6:30 and they were serving lunch.

So much bountiful produce that it's staggering; so many varieties of baked goods that it's mind-blowing; and tons of other odds and ends (spices, maple syrup, jamsjellies) to tantalize and delight you. You'll find all walks of life at the market. Everyone from hippies to grandmas to college students. It's a true sea of humanity. This market boasts the best of everything.

There are three of these booths: one for the north market, one for the central market, and one for the south market. The booth is located in the center of the market, and there's a sign indicating its location. Each of the booths is staffed by a different group of farmers, and each has a different specialty. The farmers tend to stay in their booth until the end of the market, so you can talk to them at any time. A great place to start learning about the local farmers is at the Local Produce Booth.

BigScience,yelp-207,"There's a very good reason that the Dane County Farmers' Market routinely appears on many top ten lists of best markets in the countryit's tops in every category. The market is run by a group called the Danes at Home Coalition, which has been working to bring more farmers and local food into this small rural county for decades. The coalition started with an idea back in 1999 or 2000 when it was apparent there were not enough independent farmers selling their products right here locally instead they had to travel some distance across the state border. They wanted to change that as well as provide education about healthy eating options in our community. It was just hard work from all those involved but now it's one of the most recognized events around Madison and Wisconsin's only farmers' market. So far they've brought over 99 different vendors including produce growers such as Larry Crissman who grows spices like cinnamon sticks and nutmeg. He also sells seeds. Danish milk company Ramius makes cheese, yogurt, butter, ice cream and spreads - they're proudly part of the Danish dairy industry that's spread throughout Europe since Roman times so there's plenty of things to buy if you're looking to have some fun while shopping. You can even choose your own type of cheese if you want to be adventurous The Dane County Farmers Market features both organic and non-organic foods with a wide range of flavors and prices ranging from 1 each packaged item up to 20-100 per package of heirloom tomatoes. You can't go wrong with any of these items off the menu! Organic coffee beans fresh picked from the trees themselves and roasted"

After going through all kinds of hustle and bustle getting to Japan (US Customs immigration passport control security clearance check), we were finally able to board our flight as one traveler per row for economy class flights! My wife's first experience here is that she does not like crowded rows where people are sitting side by side! She even asked us before boarding why there were only two seats available per row instead of four or five.

Great atmosphere and great food especially for someone like me that doesn't eat meat at all or even poultry. My daughter came with us when we first went there as well and they were extremely nice about it. They allow you to bring your own items in raw form so that's one of my favorite features because lets face it if you're going to order fish tacos don't have them sit around getting gross while it's cooking under hot coals. This place has taken care of our family's dietary needs now since having been here multiple times over the years! Taco Bell are awesome, especially with my two little ones who refuse to try any other type of Mexican food. So many options make Taco Bell perfect for everyone. I've gotten the classic beef burrito before too - it's delicious every time (I typically add guacamole). We love eating dinner here regularly. We usually go for chicken quesadillas.

Cadillac ranch has Happy Hour all night on Monday, so it was 12 price drinks and appetizers for as long as you stayed. Being a huge soft pretzel fan, that's where my money went tonight. Originally 8.99, these are really, really good, but probably not for full price. Two huge hot pretzels and a very unique dipping sauce which was a vat of cream cheese fondue. It was a dreamy combination. They also have a huge projector screen TV in the middle of bar and an outdoor and indoor bar. Nice place for happy hour and football, especially on Monday's."

It was absolutely delicious! For my main course, I had the chicken fried steak, which was also very good. The steak was cooked perfectly and the gravy was flavorful and rich. I finished my meal with the Cadillac Ranch cheesecake, which was the perfect way to end a great meal. I highly recommend Cadillac Ranch for anyone looking for a fun and delicious dining experience."
LLAMA,yelp-210,"I thought that I had caught the end of happy Hour as I entered about 6:30pm, but I was wrong. Cadillac ranch has Happy Hour all night on Monday, so even at 10:30pm, the drinks were still at Happy Hour prices. The place was pretty dead when I went in and the music was just a bit too loud for my tastes. The bartender was a sweetheart and I was there on a Monday night, so I'm sure she was happy to have someone to talk to. She was a little frazzled from trying to keep up with all of the Happy Hour orders, but she was nice. The place is a huge chain bar. It has 2 floors and it's 2 stories high. You can rent out a section of it for a party. The place has been there for a while and it shows. But it's not too old. The decor is made to look like a country club but it's not high end. It's a bit more of a dive bar style. There are some cute touches here and there but overall the place is a little dated. They do have a lot of TV's and they have a big bar. They have a lot of outdoor seating and patio area as well, but the interior is pretty large. I liked the place. It has a good vibe, but it's not my favorite place in the world. The beer selection was pretty good. They had about 10 on tap and I liked the choices that they had. I had a couple of Newcastle Browns and they were cold and tasty. The food was really good. I only had an appetizer, but it was really good. It was fried cheese curds and they were hot and delicious. I had ordered some more food but they messed it up and I didn't get it. It was probably my fault though. I didn't like the waitresses because she was just too slow for me. The service was pretty good overall. I didn't mind it. In the end, I had a pretty good time here. I liked the place. The bartender was a doll and I liked the food. It's a bit of a chain bar, but it's not too bad. I would recommend this place."

I decided on the Cabernet Sauvignon as my wine, and I went with the Fish Chips as my appetizer. The fish and chips were good, but I would have preferred a spicier sauce. I tried to tell the waiter, but he was too busy with the next table. I was also disappointed with the veal chops. The texture was too tough for my liking. I did like the steaks and the grilled chicken. The appetizers were the perfect accompaniment to the wine. The staff was very friendly and the service was prompt. I had never been to Cadillac Ranch before, but I'm glad I stopped by. The food and service were excellent.

Many of the patrons were drunk and loud, so have a feeling this is a local joint and the owner doesn't care. We ordered the classic sampler and had to share one sandwich, but the other two were decent. The quality of the bread was terrible and there was a huge problem with the meat on the sandwich. It was old, dry, and tough. I couldn't finish it. This was the worst meal I have had in Orlando. Service was not friendly. I will not be back. One of the worst places I've ever been to. I think it's great that they have such a huge menu. The problem is that they're trying to do everything. Ordering a drink is a nightmare. There's no way to know how much the drinks are going to cost until you order them. You have to order the food first. Then they bring you a list of the prices for the drinks. At least 5 of them have prices that are out of line with the rest of the menu. You have to order food and drink at the same time, or you will get charged for drinks that you didn't order. At the end of the meal, they have you fill out a sheet with all of your meals and drinks. It's a nightmare. I think they need to make some changes. If you're in the mood for a waiter that knows how to do his job, don't go here. The waiter that was working that night seemed to be a kid that was bored and trying to get paid. The bartender was nice, but had no idea what he was doing. They do have some pretty good drinks, but they need to keep the food simple and not have so many items on the menu.

If you want to eat good food in a large restaurant, but don't want to deal with the owner, don't go here. If you're in the mood for a restaurant that has a lot of food, but the service isn't terrible, go here. It's not worth the price of the food. It's better to eat at home and save money. This restaurant has everything you need to make a nice dinner. They have good food, a good variety of food, and they are reasonably priced.

BigScience,yelp-211,"Very overpriced for starters, but that would be fine if the food was worth it. Many of the patrons were drunk and loud, so have a feeling this is a place where you should go with friends or to just chill out. One of my favorite cafes in Far Hills! Always crowded every night of the week especially on weekends! Really great coffee shop with numerous options - including breakfasts, lunch, desserts (gelato anyone?) Authentic vibe from ages ago. Highly recommend Good selection of vegetarian dishes and other special diets are catered too well priced very yummy good quality meat also"

PaLM,yelp-212,"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I wouldn't recommend. I stayed there for a few days while visiting family, and I was really disappointed with the overall experience. The room was small and cramped, and the bed was uncomfortable. The bathroom was dirty, and the shower had no hot water. The staff was rude and unhelpful, and the front desk was constantly understaffed. The only good thing about the hotel was the location. It was close to everything, but that was about it. I would definitely not stay there again, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Here are some of the specific problems I had with the hotel:  The room was very small. There was barely enough space for a bed, a dresser, and a small table.  The bed was very uncomfortable. It was hard and lumpy, and the sheets were stained.  The bathroom was dirty. The shower was moldy, and the toilet was stained.  The staff was rude and unhelpful. They were constantly on their phones, and they didn't seem to care about the guests.  The front desk was constantly understaffed. There was always a long line, and it took forever to get checked in or checked out. Overall, I was very disappointed with my stay at the Fiesta hotel. I would not recommend it to anyone. Here are some other hotels in the area that I would recommend instead:  The Crowne Plaza Hotel is a great option for business travelers. It is located close to the airport and the convention center, and it offers a variety of amenities, including a fitness center, a business center, and a pool.  The Hilton Garden Inn is a good option for families. It is located close to the zoo and the children's museum, and it offers a variety of amenities, including a playground, a swimming pool, and a kids' club.  The Holiday Inn Express is a good option for budget travelers. It is located close to the city center and the shopping district, and it offers a variety of amenities, including a free breakfast and a free Wi-Fi."
Tsinghua,yelp-212,"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I would not recommend to anyone. It was clean and well maintained, but that was about it. The room was small and had only one working light. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and there was no coffee or tea in the room. They did not provide a fan, only a small vent on the ceiling. The only other thing was that they did not provide any kind of paper or paper towels. I was fortunate enough to get a single room, but there were some rooms that were double, and they were so small that you couldn't even turn around. The best thing was the location. It was very close to the Super Walmart, where I did most of my shopping, and it was very close to the bus station, which was a plus. The bus station was so crowded that I didn't get to see much of it, but the bus station did have a restaurant, so that was a plus. The other negative was the cost. The rooms were very basic, but they did include the use of a fridge and microwave. However, the prices were outrageous. The most I paid was 25 a night for a single room. I was told that it was the best price they had for the rooms, and that was after I spent an hour on the phone negotiating with them. They do have a sign that states that you should pay with a credit card, but I was told that I could pay with cash. When I asked for a credit card number to pay with, they gave me a form that stated that they would only accept a credit card if I was paying for the room with cash.

LLAMA,yelp-212,"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I would never want to go again. The hotel itself is dirty and in need of updating, the view is of the side of the next building, and the room is not big enough to fit a couch in. The service is slow and the food is not good. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone else. Loved every minute of it and will definitely come back! The hotel and the rooms are clean and fairly new. The location is perfect for a family. The hotel has a lot of activities for children, including a mini disco and a mini club. The food is really good and the entertainment team are friendly and entertaining. The beach is 5 minutes away and the town 15 minutes. The hotel is child friendly and very family orientated. The only problem we had was the local area, as the town is not particularly child friendly and there is not much to do or see. It was a great holiday and I loved the whole thing! The hotel was a good size and was always clean and tidy. The food was amazing, there was always something to eat. The bar was always open and it was always easy to get a drink. The hotel was in a good location, near to the beach and the town. The hotel had great entertainment for children and adults. It was a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. Fantastic hotel, great location and good food. Good location, close to the beach. The rooms were clean and modern, but not the best views. The food was OK, with a good variety of options.

Human,yelp-212,"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I wouldn't stay anytime in the near future unless they changed a few things. Better service - many of the staff were not accommodating nor friendly Cleaner roomshotel in general - the carpet was filthy and rooms weren't cleaned well More things for kids to do Clearer rules and amenities - they say Internet is complimentary in the rooms, but desk staff say it costs a certain amount per day and no room coffee Better food - actual hotel food wasn't good, but Subways, Villas, Starbucks was good Cheaper ATM fees - 3.75 is way too expensive to be pulling money out of an ATM Our room wasn't ready when we arrived to check in, but all of our friends who arrived beforearound the same time we did had rooms ready. They told us to check a later to see if a room was ready. Another person, who arrived later than us, was given the room we had wanted, which was right across from our friends. They then proceeded to give us the very last room in the hall, but everyone else from our group on that floor was towards the front of the hall. Eventually, they conceded us a room about a quarter of the way from the end of the hall. When another of our friends arrived with her family, they were given rooms on the floor above us. All three of those rooms smelled like cigarette and cigar smoke. The underside of the comforters in our friend's room was dirty; and after getting help from the maid to remove all the linens and spray the room with air freshener, they found the smell tolerable enough for the night. They gave her a different set of rooms on the Seventh Floor when all of us were on the 2nd floor. We were there for an event and needed a space to practice because none of the rooms were large enough to be a suitable dance space. So, another member of the group talked with the desk people and the manager to see if there was some way to get a room or another place to practice. None of them were of any help. They said they couldn't unlock any of the meeting rooms. Luckily, we discovered that the pool area was large enough to practice. On the second day, the pool was closed without any notification prior to our arrival. The only notification we received was a letter from the hotel stating the pool would be closed all day Saturday and that arrived somewhere around 11pm Friday night. It turned out that the pool had been closed for a wedding reception. And since we were using the space to practice, we couldn't practice. A lot of our group had been planning on leaving Sunday, and many of them had young children who had been looking forward to the pool now had nothing to do and most of them left the hotel to find a suitable activity for their children. Our group director tried to get a comp night for us because of the closed pool and the hotel staff's refusal to accommodate our need for a room, but the manager wouldn't give the comp night. Our director was able to get us a 20 food discount per room. But because much our group had planned to check out on Sunday, many of them were not able to take advantage of this. A few of us tried to take advantage of the discount by going to the buffet. However, they told us that in order to split our group of 8 people into three groups we would not be guaranteed tables near each other. So, we had to dish out 30. The food at the buffet ranged from good to okay to bad. A lot of it was dried out, hard as a rock, or covered with too much sauce. Although there is an arcade, a movie theatre, and a pool available to the kids, the arcade was tiny and half of the machines in the arcade were broken and the movie theatre wasn't showing any movies that didn't interest any of the kids and the pool was closed for an entire day. Kids weren't even allowed to stand by the post in front of the reception desk because it was too close to the machines. The entrances to the hotel should not have slot machines 5 feet from the entrance because there is nowhere for kids to wait if they are waiting for their parents to check in. The air conditioner in our room was noisy and the remote to set for auto startauto off was broken. The seal on the bottom of our tub was almost gone and there were stains on the wall; one of the rooms had a broken ironing board and no iron, which was greatly needed; and, the door of another was not straight and made the door difficult to open."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-212,"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I would not want my family or myself staying again. They do have nice rooms with flat screens tv's which are good for business people who like working in their room while travelling (however you can't hear them on non-flat screen TVs), however there was no hot water so we had very little shower time at all during our 3 days here! Also when they say breakfast included - its only continental style bagels coffee..no cerealfruit toast etc...its simply gross considering that everyone wants something quick before going out every morning!! There were also constant ""issues"" throughout checkin' into this establishment: they said one day by two different staff memebers tht i forgot an item from previous nights luggage left behind after checking ourselves oout; 2nd night someone gave us wrong information about how many floors up fifth avenue building where conference location will held b4 leaving house early am next mornogg telling me he needed more than what his contract called ffor overseeing event site security....i dont know why these things happened BUT couldnt happen if management put best efforts toward making sure guests leave happy.....it seems thats too much effort 4them even tho u pay thru nose!!!

BigScience,yelp-212,"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I would avoid. We arrived at midnight on Friday night (my husband's birthday), after taking off all my makeup in preparation for a late-night bachelorette party we were attending later that evening... We had booked our room ahead through Expedia - there was no reception desk so if you didn't book your room online then they are very limited with what rooms can accommodate. There must have been 6 or 7 other couples just like us who made up most of the crowd, which meant we couldn't find any single beds! The noise level inside from other guests using their in-room bars etc. makes sleeping impossible. The hallway entrance doors open out onto each corridor, right next door to each other; however these corridors don't go back into the main building all the way around where you'll see another couple's room in front of yours, yet when you walk outside to get back in again you're immediately surrounded by the same people coming to collect themselves, dinnerdrinks etc. This means everyone walking past has to scan every person else in order to see whether there's anyone available! There wasn't even an attention grabbing sign anywhere telling me where everything was located within the property to keep me alert. It took nearly 20 minutes before someone came to ask how things went during my early morning breakfast service request: What could possibly make this place work? 1) A couple of really good-looking blokes - maybe not enough cocktails, 2) noisy residents 3) Good value 4) Adult pool 5) The location... Surely, somewhere more central? Unfortunately all 8 non-stop flights arrive via Heathrow Airport, meaning we need to take our bus to Westgate Shopping Centre - across town. Don't worry: it's free, takes about 40 mins and stops close-by. However, the bus only runs between 16am 10pm Monday-Friday, Saturday 12-9pm and Sunday 11-8:30 pm. Unfortunately that's neither convenient nor practical unless you happen to live near the airport. There's also quite a lot of freeway traffic going over the motorways too, especially towards Hughenden Road, giving terrible visibility. My trip involved driving around London checking out places I've never visited such as: Holland Park Whitechapel, Camden Town, Brentford High Street, St Pancras Rail station and Waterloo Station and Central Hall. Outside of London I'd probably give two thumbs down as well. Whatever attractions we did visit were disappointing, including Watney Wallace Museum, Madame Tussauds, Tower Bridge and Kensington Palace. They do offer childcare facilities under 10 per day, but they're literally beyond horrendous. From the moment we walked in, kids kept running away screaming while creaking furniture rattled everywhere, making Mark sweat profusely trying to hold them calm down. I know I'm being harsh here, but one thing I will say is: If you've got young children come prepared with diapers andor lots of extra clothes. After nearly three days without changing clothing, grocery shopping and cooking meals myself due to lack of supplies, I thought my home life would become unbearable if ever I felt compelled to leave the house in search of a toilet closed otherwise I'll take it personal (it's April 16th!)."

The food is all locally sourced, seasonal and fresh. I had a breakfast sandwich with eggs, bacon, guacamole and spinach on a roll that was amazing. The only reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars is because the service was a little lacking. We were served by 2 different people and they were both inattentive. That said, it was a busy day, and they were understaffed. This is a fun and innovative place to go with friends. Everyone can pick their own style of food and the vibe of the place is lively and inviting. The perfect spot for a casual bite to eat. The menu was diverse with a wide selection of choices. We shared the fried chicken sandwich and the roasted cauliflower sandwich and both were quite good. The staff was friendly and service was quick. I can't wait to try this place again! I've been here a few times now and I've loved every minute of it. The staff is always super friendly and the food is always amazing. I had the chicken and waffles and I can honestly say it was the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. My friend got the chicken and avocado sandwich and it looked amazing as well. I'm definitely going to come back here again and try something else on the menu. I've eaten here a few times and am always impressed with the food and service. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and the food is always delicious. I like the design of the restaurant, nice atmosphere. Unfortunately the service was not great at all. It took a really long time to get the food, and it was not even that busy. And for the price, I was not impressed with the food. I have been here twice now. The first time I got a sandwich and it was delicious. The second time I got the fried chicken and it was not as good as the sandwich. I did enjoy the atmosphere, but the service was not that great."

The staff was friendly and efficient. They also have a wide variety of caffeinated beverages, and coffee, tea and juice in a cooler that was easy to access. The airport is so convenient, so the location is perfect. But the service is definitely what I would recommend, they will be your new go to airport restaurant! I've been a customer for 20 years and will continue to do so. 100. The staff is very friendly and always helpful. It's nice to know they're there when you need them. Honestly, you could go to any of the other airports in the world and find a better place to eat. They do have to cut corners somewhere, but for the price and quality, this place is phenominal. I always bring my own snacks and I don't think I've ever had a bad meal. I was there on business and I had lunch there for about 10. Huge portions, great food and excellent service. There's even a ""green"" smoothie option that is very good and pretty cheap. It's very close to the gate and I recommend it highly. I was in the terminal for 12 hours for a layover and it was the only restaurant open in the area that offered a good variety of food. The breakfast sandwich was huge, they also had salads, bagels, etc. I ordered the chicken, green beans and french toast, and it was delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. The service was quick, and the food was delicious. I got a toasted bagel with cream cheese and a large latte for under 10. The staff is friendly and the location is perfect for getting a bite to eat. This place is great for those who are on the run and want to grab something to eat before their flight. Plenty of healthy options to choose from. I ordered a fruit plate, two salads and a glass of wine for less than 30. The service was very friendly and the food was delicious. I was there for an overnight layover, and I was able to eat at the airport and still make it to my connecting flight on time. The service was fast and the food was tasty. I recommend this place for a quick bite to eat before your flight. This is a very nice restaurant, with friendly staff and good food. They have a lot of variety, and the prices are very reasonable. They have a full breakfast menu, and it's all delicious. I've been here a few times, and I've always been satisfied. The breakfast is excellent, and they also have sandwiches and salads. The service is friendly and quick. The location is very convenient, and the restaurant is in the terminal building, so it's easy to get to. This place is a good choice for a quick bite to eat. I usually order the waffles and eggs, and they are delicious. The staff is very friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. I've been to this restaurant several times, and I always have a great experience. This place is a bit pricey, but the food is delicious. I always order the tuna salad sandwich and the chicken and waffles. The service is fast and friendly, and the restaurant is located in the terminal building, so it's easy to get to."
PaLM,yelp-214,I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it. Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails. Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to anything. I went in to purchase 4 4x4 pressure treated posts and 4x4 caps. The employee who helped me was very helpful and went with me to get the posts. When we got to the register the total was over $100.00 and I asked for the military discount. The cashier rang up the order and then told me that I could not get the discount because I needed to show my military ID. I showed her my military ID and she said that it was not valid because it was not expired. I explained that I had just recently renewed my ID and it was not expired. She then said that the only way I could get the discount was if I had a military star card. I told her that I did not have a military star card and I asked if there was anything else I could do to get the discount. She said no and that I would have to pay full price. I was very disappointed with the way that I was treated. I felt like the cashier was not being helpful and was trying to make it difficult for me to get the discount. I also felt like management was not being helpful because they did not do anything to resolve the situation. I will not be shopping at this Lowe's again and I would not recommend it to anyone.
LLAMA,yelp-214,"I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it. Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails. Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to their mistakes. I recently bought a dishwasher from Lowes and they scheduled to install it the next day. They guy came in and did a shoddy job. The plumber installed it with no leveling feet and left the sealant for my husband to figure out. He went ahead and installed it but the next morning there was a flood in the kitchen. My husband went to go talk to the manager and told him what happened. He denied that there was any flooding and told my husband to stop lying. He told him that the installer did a good job and left the store. My husband came home and sent me a picture of the flooded kitchen with water on the cabinets and flooring and the manager still denied it. He told me that I was lying and that there was no flooding. I have a video showing it, pictures, and witnesses. The installer himself said that he had to place the leveling feet in the back because it wasn't level. So apparently the manager has his own set of eyes and decides to make his own reality. How do you own up to your mistakes when you won't even accept that they exist? I have been to Lowe's before and this is not a one time thing. It seems like there is a disconnect from management and employees and management lacks integrity and accountability. I will NEVER step foot in this store again. I have learned my lesson. It took 2.5 hours for 2 employees to install my washer and dryer. Both employees had to be trained by other employees in the store on how to install washer and dryer. This is not a DIY install, this is a Lowe's install. The company was supposed to come and install it but the installer didn't show up. They didn't call me to let me know the installer didn't show up. I had to call the store to find out what happened to my appointment. I got a call that the installer never showed up. This is unacceptable. When I called the store to complain about my experience, the manager was rude and didn't apologize. He told me that he would get me a better price on the installation but that he couldn't give me a refund because the store lost money on the install. This is ridiculous. I've always had a good experience at Lowe's but today was awful. I will never recommend this store to anyone. How do I know I can trust these reviews about Lowe's? I bought a washer and dryer at Lowe's in Centerville, Ohio. The washer had a problem right away. They said they couldn't find a part to fix it. The dryer was working fine until a week ago. They had to order a part and will be here Tuesday to fix it. I wanted to change to a different brand. They said no. It was unbelievable. I bought a washer and dryer from Lowe's in Midlothian, Texas on September 15, 2018. I had purchased the 4 year warranty. The washer started to leak water and the dryer was not getting dry. We called Lowe's to come out to check it out. They came out and said that the washer was not level. They leveled it and said the dryer was working fine. We did another load of laundry and it was still not getting dry. We called again to have them come back out. The same two men came out again. They said the dryer was level and working fine. They turned the washer on and said the water was leaking and that it had to be the hose. They said it was not covered under the warranty. They said that the hose was on the house and that they would not fix it. We called a plumber to come out to check it out. The plumber checked the hose and said that it was not the hose and that the washer was leaking and not to use it. He said that the seals were bad. He said that it was the washer. We called Lowe's and they said to bring the washer back. We took the washer back and they gave us a new one. The same two men came out to install the new washer. We had just finished a load of laundry and it was still wet in the dryer. They came out and checked it out. They said that the dryer was level and working fine. We did another load of laundry and it was still wet."

When they did show up the units they were going to deliver were damaged and undeliverable. They delivery guys said they'd get us new units that day or the next. After waiting 24 hrs for a call from Lowes, I called and was told it won't be in till Wednesday. Well I wasted another day waiting around for a delivery that didn't come. Absolutely no management took responsibility for the mistakes, it was all'this wasn't my mistake' or'I'm just finding out about this'. Absolutely no one was going to call me it seems instead they were find just taking my money. I know its a hardware store but seriously when someone gives you money principle dictates you give them their purchase."
BigScience,yelp-214,"I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it. Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails. Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to the facts or give a positive response. This past weekend I was at Lowes trying to find some jack screws for my work bench (small) that didn't come in Decatur, GA stores like Lowe's, Home Depot Ace Hardware. The one closest being Home Depot; home depot doesn't have any screw sizes. So a friend suggested going to Lowes as they had more options. We were there to pick out 2 different items when we got to the tool section she asked me if I wanted anything else? She then said that ""it would be nice"" if I could meet her over at The Shoppes on Fox Lake Rd. because they had an assortment of things that Home Depot did not stock. This is where it went sour from disingenuousness towards real customer service which you will see next. My wife I walked inside The Shoppes right away; experienced rude staff who appeared to know the merchandise well enough to walk around with them asking people about what type of stuff they might wantneed. They took our money literally left us hanging there while the driver drove off to get something.....while he stopped by every few minutes to check out how much time we'd been standing there! Why don't you take your customers outside after paying for their purchases?! If you're going to say no to anybody coming into here thinking that you've seen everything before....you best make sure it's worth buying otherwise I'd personally rather go somewhere that's honest! The warrantied parts department was very helpful. I've bought all sorts of high tech equipment used and especially expensive new appliances from Aldi's. These guys really helped me figure out equipment issues including replacing bulbs for two refrigerators. Very pleased with both experiences. Great place to shop...great prices....the hardware dept.....what can i say....I wish other shops would adopt these policies Good quality products plus great pricing with good shipping times. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Great selection of tools and repair services available within reasonable proximity. Love shopping at Lowes!! It has become more than just furniture, now its apparel, electronics etc. Plus sales. It's the only place near me to buy brand name clothes. I've always taken advantage of their great deals. Love to drive 40 miles to Walmart sometimes and still beat the lowes price on many items. We love Mayflower Tool Mart. The owner is awesome too. He let us use his truck to tow a broken down car whilst fixing our chimney in the winter. A true gentleman. What made you decide to rebrand your career path? How long ago did you quit your day job and start working full-time on WordPress? Well, I think it's pretty obvious why I turned toward blogging: I loved marketing my clients' websites and started getting paid doing so. But, 10 years later I'm happy to report that my passion and deep belief in helping others succeed through online income streams continues unabated."
Tsinghua,yelp-214,"I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it. Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails. Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to anything. When you call, they say, ""Well, there's nothing we can do, but we can get a manager to call you back."" Well, you get a manager who will have a whole different attitude. I had a question about my warranty that I called to ask and the manager couldn't even tell me if my product was covered under the warranty. So, I called back and asked for a manager who could tell me. He had a new attitude. He told me that the previous manager wasn't authorized to give me that information. So, I have to go back to the original manager. I have already wasted my time once and that was an hour ago. I just called back to find out the answer to my question. I had to leave another message and ask for a manager and this time he told me that the warranty only covered the original purchase and nothing after that. So, I am in the same boat I was before. He was a different person, but his attitude and the way he answered the phone was just awful. If you have to go through a manager, at least get a decent one. I called back because my floor is covered in scratches and they don't give a damn. I bought this thing for 400 and it's worth about 200. Lowes is a huge store and I thought that I could trust them, but I was wrong. So, my advice is go to Home Depot. At least they have a decent manager. Lowes was so incompetent. The workers who were supposed to do the work were 25 years old and couldn't tell me how to use the router. I had to get an engineer who was almost 50 to show me how to use it. I bought a ceiling fan that needed a 3-inch hole in the ceiling and it turned out to be 3 12 inches. I had to call them back and tell them what I wanted and they told me they would have to cut a bigger hole. So, I called them back and said, ""How do I make a 3-inch hole in a 3 12 inch ceiling?"" They said they couldn't do it. So, I told them to get a bigger fan and they did. I was just disgusted with them. I called Lowes and I had to leave a message and they never called me back. So, I had to call them back and I called again and they said, ""Well, you can come back in a few weeks."" So, I called again and they said, ""We're going to get you a manager to call you back."" I called back and they said the manager was busy. I called back and they said, ""We'll get back to you."" They don't even know when they are going to get back to you. Lowes sucks. I am tired of this store. The same thing is happening every time I go in there. It's ridiculous. I have a 10-foot ceiling fan and it's a 3-inch hole in the ceiling. It's not a big deal, but they don't care. I was so frustrated with them. I bought a patio chair from Lowes and it was bent. I called them back and they said they would send someone out to fix it. I called back and they said they would have someone out to fix it in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days. They are going to be in and out in 4 days. I'm tired of it. I called Lowes because I needed a new oil filter for my lawn mower. I called back and they said they would have someone out to fix it in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days. I called back and they said they would have someone out in a few days.

Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to mistakes, or even acknowledge them at all! The high volume of complains I made was not ignored as if they never happened - nope the manager actually had a list for me with my complaints on her desk (oops!) Then she proceeded making excuses about why those were routine things that happen in any business every day...She basically said ""people will be people"" which translates into: try harder next timedon't dramatize so we can get back our decent profits."" The attitude is quite shocking when you know how much low-priced items cost here vs others stores like Home Depot Walmart etc? 20 per toilet paper roll??? Ridiculous!!! After years working there myself......they need more training than anything else because once one mistake happens after another without consequence then management won;'s care anymore....This place has been slowly dying since last year..They have tried everything from having special sales tactics during holidays such Black Friday week where EVERYTHING goes out 5 dollars cheaper{which 95 most customers didn "" go buy}, weekend deals {some 20-30, yet again only few shop}, ads posted above sinks telling shoppers discounts (also got many empty spaces left), luring seniors by offering free meals over Saturdays 4pm 2 days before Christmas and somehow stealing money off kids through sale pricing tricks.....all these efforts finally resulted failure now..Worst part being some staffers who work under three managers hired way too fast believing corporate would eventually offer permanent jobs based upon hardwork experience gained while still subordinates........very sad indeed!!!!! Very thankful i'm moving away soon!!"
OpenAI,yelp-214,I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it. Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails. Management hides behind their employees and don't own up I'm sorry to hear that you've had a bad experience at Lowes. It can be frustrating when the management doesn't take ownership of their mistakes. Have you tried reaching out to customer service or a higher-level manager to express your concerns? They may be able to address the issues you faced and improve the situation for future customers.

Very sad when you consider there are plenty of good places to eat around here. Great place, but they have terrible customer service.. Ordered chicken wings on Sunday night from 3:30pm - 5:45pm no one ever came by it was like 9 hours later we called 4 different times (we were leaving town) what a horrible experience!!!!!! My wife and i celebrated our anniversary at El Faro Restaurant in August 2010. We ordered San Marzano tomatoes, fajita meatloaf, shrimp enchiladas and mojito bowl. My wife then went out with her friends. When she returned 15 minutes before closing time, my two orders had already been taken care of. She was very upset because this is not how things work at any restaurant anywhere. The staff seemed oblivious to everything being done behind us as if nothing happened. She complained about their lackadaisical attitude and incompetence. They tried to make amends afterward offering me some kind of discount which I declined since my meal had been completed. This was an obvious attempt to cover up poor service instead of trying to fix it. No apology or compensation provided whatsoever. Best margaritas I've tasted in years. A little expensive though...unless it's your birthday. Great idea to include a bottle opener so that those who don't want a drink can still share. Denny's is an excellent restaurant with fast service. But during an annual trip to visit family, their food failed to meet expectations. Would prefer another type of menu item such as pizza than fried seafood This was first time going to dine-in; really nice decoration inside the establishment. Food was cooked well under supervision of the chef. Family order was served promptly without interruptions. Service was excellent. Will definitely be visiting again. Excellent Mexican cuisine. Delicious entrees. Excellent appetizers. Clean environment. Staff is properly trained and friendly. Good value for money! I attended a friend's wedding reception at El Faro today and loved every minute of it. Everyone commented on the food. Everything fresh, great presentation, the flavorful sauces and overall amazingness of the food. The service was outstanding too! Our waiter was extremely helpful and made sure everyone had enough wine while waiting for dessert. He also kept checking in with my husband about his favorite dishes throughout dinner. Can NOT say enough positive words concerning their review! Thank-you for helping send people over to try El Faro!! Family dining has become a tradition whenever we come to Durham NC. This year our group decided the best choice would be El Faro. Their music played softly until 6 pm., perfect mood to enjoy each dish. It was fun having all ages together enjoying Las Cruces traditions along with delicious Cuban inspired foods. All within easy walking distance of each other making for lots of laughs and conversations. The grand opening threw Outstanding Home Care LLC into high gear preparing our full-day event. In addition to giving away free gifts including coffee mugs, toothbrush sets, pens, calendars, baby essentials, and more, we received hundreds of requests for home health information and referrals. And thanks to media coverage, the opportunity expanded beyond Monterey County. At 11:12 p.m., the doors opened for guests eager to learn even more about home healthcare services: primary medical visits - including pediatrician visits - and geriatric assessments. Customer interactions began immediately outside the venue before moving inside. In attendance included Lori Smith, CEOCofounder of Outstanding Home Care LLC; Diane Jernigan Brickle, president of Healthy Aging Services Inc. (HASI), the parent company providing these important services; Jaime Lopez, director of operations for HASI; Karen Greenfield, vice presidentowner of Max Medical Group (MMG), serving Rollins College students seeking free medical checkups through MMG; Bonnie Erb, executive director of Community Coalition on Homelessness (CCOH), whose organization partners with HomeCareMD providers nationwide to provide homebased care opportunities to homeless individuals without access to traditional long-term-care facilities; Michelle Leonard, founder and owner of KiddiWalkers International Ltd.; Jennifer Bridges, regional manager for Cal-Home Builders Association; Debbie Chastain, senior representative for Health Insurance Plans Foundation; Lisa Buckley, assistant marketing coordinator for California Hospital Association (CHA), representing the hospital association affiliated with CHA; Terry Liu, chief financial officer of CHOP PACE Living Center, part of CHOP Health System, and Dorothy Remington, business development specialist for Alzheimer Consultants."
Tsinghua,yelp-215,"Truly awful service and food! Think of half the quality of Denny's food for three times the price! I would never go back. Very sad when you consider there are so many Denny's in the area! Not very fair to give it a bad review. I have no doubt they are a wonderful restaurant, but that's not the issue. The issue is that they are not providing a good experience. sanxiyn After I posted the story to Twitter, I started receiving emails from other people who said that they had been affected by the same service problem. I suspect it's not an isolated incident. I once went to a large Korean restaurant in Shenzhen, China. The server was polite, but had a really weird accent. It took her some time to explain that the beer was 10 yuan per bottle and 20 yuan per can, but she insisted that it was 10 yuan per bottle and 10 yuan per can. It took me a while to figure out that the 10 yuan per bottle was for the bottle itself, not for the can. I have to admit that I was also confused by the fact that she had such a weird accent. I've never heard a 16-year-old Korean speak with such an accent. It wasn't that the restaurant was that great, but it was definitely a good restaurant. ythn I wonder if this is because China is becoming more and more cosmopolitan, or just because China is becoming more and more liberal in its approach to international business. In the past, I have noticed that Chinese customer service in foreign businesses tends to be very ""Chinese,"" in the sense that they are not only very uncooperative and unhelpful, but also extremely rude. redsymbol This isn't a local problem, it's a global problem. This is especially true for the retail side of the food industry. In a restaurant, the staff is only working on the one dish they are responsible for. In retail, the staff is dealing with all of the dishes they are responsible for. For example, the pizza delivery guy is working with a dozen or more different pizzas, each with a different recipe, toppings, and ingredients. austenallred I was in China a few years ago and I had the same problem at the local KFC. I thought I was in a good restaurant and I was disappointed. It's the same with many of the local food trucks I've seen. I wonder if this has to do with how Chinese people prefer their food? asadlionpk A very Chinese approach to doing business. ""How can I make this more difficult for you?"" maaarghk I think there is a cultural element here. In the US, if a restaurant doesn't have a good review, you can just not go there. In China, it's different. In the US, if a restaurant is ""on fire"" then they will find customers. In China, if a restaurant is ""on fire"" then the customers will go there. tombert I'm curious if this is just due to the different customer expectations in China vs. the US. Americans expect to get service and food at the same time, but in China, they might get the food and not get the service, or vice versa. peter303 This could be because of the extreme need for Chinese people to have the restaurant staff believe they are the best at what they do, to sell their products. This is to keep the customers from getting frustrated and quitting. mnm1 This is similar to a problem in the USA. One time I was in a restaurant and the waiter took forever to get my food. After I got it, I was ready to leave and told the waiter that I was ready to leave. He said ""I will get you a glass of water."" I asked ""you didn't bring me a glass of water, why are you bringing me one now?"" He said ""I will bring you one now because I'm not going to bring you one later."" He went on to do the same thing with 3 other dishes. When I finally left, he tried to argue with me about the bill. I said ""I paid 20 for this meal. Do you want to charge me for the water you just brought me?"" He didn't have a good answer. ggreer This is the same in the UK. In London, the taxi drivers are super- unhelpful and rude. Piskvorrr Oh dear. A world in which service providers have a hard time earning their keep. eruditely The fact that your comment is not downvoted is an indication of this world."

At night you can see some young guys hanging out there. I enjoy watching these sports competitions as well since they usually get pretty good ratings but my favorite one to watch would be US Open tennis because it gets aired live in New York City! The people here seem very open minded about taking drugs, except for marijuana which seems like everyone has an opinion against using (at least at work). They say if you're going to smoke weed then why not use it all day long? That's really what happens when someone says it's a bad thing so many times until they actually become addicted. But with alcohol, cigarettes, etc., nobody has any problem saying how bad those things are once they've gotten hooked up!"
LLAMA,yelp-216,"Quite honestly, the reason that I am a fan is that they have a lot of pool tables, they offer free pool on certain nights, and the bartenders, male or female, are all absolutely stunning. Also, they have a good jukebox, and have great prices on drinks. I'm not sure about the beer prices, because I don't drink it. At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised that this was not a ""no-smoking"" bar, because I love smoking when I go out and play pool. I will admit, however, that they have improved the ventilation system, which makes it easier to breathe when you are playing pool and smoking. I can't say anything bad about the place, because I haven't had anything bad happen. The bartenders and the staff have always been extremely nice to me, and the patrons of the bar have also been nice. I will say that it's a little older crowd, but I don't think that makes it a bad bar. I'm 35 years old, and most of the people there are older than me, but not old enough that they're not having fun. If you're looking for a fun place to play pool, this is definitely the place to go! I've never been disappointed."

Human,yelp-217,"Hello my fellow Phoenicians and snow birds! It's time for another truthful review.... I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the way to a day trip in the Superstitions. I did read some scary reviews but since there seems to be only one hole in the wall diner in the area we took our chances and here it is in one word... YUK! There was one server and she ran her butt off, although I only saw her once I felt sorry for her as the place was filled. The busboys hauled ass cleaning tables, delivering food and everything else so Good Job to all of you! We got there just past 11 and was told we could no longer get breakfast yet 3 tables around us ordered breakfast so we did too. We ordered eggs basted but I really knew better.... Not everyone knows how to cook them and corned beef hash which I ordered WELL done. Of course the top was cooked well and middle not at all so I asked if they could put it back on the grill to cook it more... As they walked away we heard one guy tell the other to put it in the microwave! Lol When I got it back..... Well, do I really need to tell you? The food was hot but not cooked and the based eggs were literally rubberized.... The yolk was hard not runny as a basted egg should be. One of the guys came back and I told him the eggs weren't basted he insisted the were... I picked the eggs up by the white and it dangled there looking like they were Rubber! I ate the cooked top part of the hash and half piece of toast and my husband ate his bacon and part of the pancake, we asked for our check and told him how disappointed we were and all he did was apologize.... I told him he should be offering to comp the un eaten meal... He gave me a funny look and took back the check and said it would come out of his paycheck! I said absolutely not and told him I would pay and he shouldn't take the loss because the cook doesn't know how to cook! I left a most generous tip and we Left.... We noticed the help wanted sign for server and cook and I do hope they find people quick..... Especially someone who calls themselves a cook and actually knows what a freaking basted egg is! I feel sorry for all the snowbirds who flocked this diner that this is there only choice for food in town and even sorrier they somehow developed a taste for this crud on a plate! The only reason I was generous and gave 2 stars is because I felt sorry for the hard working staff! So there it is, plain and true! Try it if you want..... But don't say you weren't warned! Enjoy the weather and Bon Appetite'"

I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the street. So here it is, I have been a client of the same massage therapist for about 4 years and she is the best. She does not give the typical spa type massage that some people get here, she really gives you what you pay for, she knows what she is doing. I have been to many different massage therapists and I have to say I am impressed with how she does her job. If you go here you will be very happy. It is a very small place but I have to say that it is a very clean and well kept place. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone."
PaLM,yelp-217,"Hello my fellow Phoenicians and snow birds! It's time for another truthful review. I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the street. I have been a customer at this location for over 10 years and have always been happy with the service until recently. A few months ago I went in to get my oil changed and rotate my tires. I was quoted $40 for the oil change and $20 for the tire rotation. I agreed to the price and waited for my car to be done. When I went to pay the bill I was charged $70. I asked the cashier why I was charged $30 more and she said it was because I needed new wiper blades. I told her that I didn't need new wiper blades and that I didn't approve of the additional charge. She said that she couldn't do anything about it and that I would have to talk to the manager. I went to talk to the manager and he told me that the cashier was right and that I did need new wiper blades. I told him that I didn't need new wiper blades and that I didn't approve of the additional charge. He said that he couldn't do anything about it and that I would have to pay the bill or leave. I left the store without paying the bill and filed a complaint with corporate. A few days later I received a call from corporate and they told me that they would be refunding my money. I went back to the store to pick up my refund and the manager apologized for the misunderstanding. I am still not happy with the way I was treated at this location and I will not be returning. I would recommend that you take your business elsewhere. Here are some other reviews from customers who have had similar experiences:  ""I went in for an oil change and was quoted $40. When I got the bill it was $70. I asked why and they said it was because I needed new wiper blades. I told them I didn't need new wiper blades and they said that they had already put them on my car. I refused to pay for the wiper blades and they refused to give me my car back. I had to call the police to get my car back. I will never be going back to this place again.""  ""I went in for a tire rotation and was quoted $20. When I got the bill it was $50. I asked why and they said it was because I needed new brake pads. I told them I didn't need new brake pads and they said that they had already put them on my car. I refused to pay for the brake pads and they refused to give me my car back. I had to call the police to get my car back. I will never be going back to this place again.""  ""I went in for a simple oil change and was quoted $30. When I got the bill it was $100. I asked why and they said it was because they had to replace the serpentine belt. I told them that I didn't need a new serpentine belt and they said that they had already put one on my car. I refused to pay for the serpentine belt and they refused to give me my car back. I had to call the police to get my car back. I will never be going back to this place again."" These are just a few of the many reviews that customers have left about this location. It is clear that this is not a place that you want to take your car. If you value your time and money, I would recommend that you take your business elsewhere."
OpenAI,yelp-217,"Hello my fellow Phoenicians and snow birds! It's time for another truthful review.... I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the street, and I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with my recent experience at a local restaurant. The service was poor, the food was cold and mediocre at best, and the atmosphere was lackluster. I don't want to name names, but I feel it's important to share my honest opinion so that others don't waste their time and money. There are so many great dining options in the area, and unfortunately this was not one of them."
LLAMA,yelp-217,"Hello my fellow Phoenicians and snow birds! It's time for another truthful review.... I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the street who is sick and tired of the way the city of Phoenix is ran and would like some changes for the betterment of the community! So I just had a very unfortunate run in with a Phoenix cop a couple days ago and let me tell you I was shocked and appalled at the way he handled the situation. It all started when I was in a very bad accident last year on my motorcycle. I hit a car at high speed and did a lot of damage to myself. I had no insurance at the time so I was forced to wait until I had a job and the money to buy a new bike and insurance before I could get a license. So I worked for a month or so, saved my money and bought my new bike and insurance. A few days ago I received a phone call from a police officer who identified himself as officer Garcia who said he was calling in reference to the accident and had a few questions. I told him I was very sorry for the inconvenience and I was in the process of getting a new bike and insurance and he said he just had a few questions and I could answer them over the phone. I answered his questions and thought everything was ok. He then said he needed to see me to issue me a ticket for driving without a license. He said he would be at my house the next day at 4:30pm. I told him I have to work and he said I would have to leave work early to meet him at my house. So I left work early and went home to meet him. He showed up around 5:30pm and was very rude and condescending to me. He asked me for my license and I said I didn't have one yet and he got very upset and said I was wasting his time. He said he was going to have me towed, and I said what for? I told him I had a new bike and new insurance and he said that doesn't matter and gave me the ticket and left. I think this officer should be reprimanded and not be allowed to do traffic enforcement anymore. He was very rude and disrespectful and didn't seem to care that I had just been in a life threatening accident. He should be more sensitive to his victims and realize that we are all human and have a story to tell. I work for the city of Phoenix in a different department and I would never treat someone with so much disrespect and I don't think anyone else should either. I feel that this officer should be reprimanded and not be allowed to do traffic enforcement anymore.

I feel that this officer should be reprimanded and not be allowed to do traffic enforcement anymore. I am a resident of Glendale, Arizona. I am writing in regards to an experience I had on October 22, 2015, at approximately 2:15 pm. I was driving down the 51 and took the Bethany Home Road exit. I entered the left hand turn lane to make a U-turn. When the light turned green, I proceeded to make the U-turn. As I was making the U-turn, a police officer pulled out in front of me. The officer was turning right on to Bethany Home Road. I had to stop to avoid a collision. The officer immediately turned on his lights and pulled me over. The officer approached my car and asked me for my driver's license and insurance. I gave the officer my license and insurance. He then asked me what I was doing. I explained that I was making a U-turn. He then asked me if I ever heard of a green arrow. I told him that I did. The officer then asked me if I know what it meant. I told him that the green arrow meant that I could make the U-turn. The officer told me that I was wrong and that I needed to yield to the green light on the other side of the intersection. I am sorry, but I am not wrong. The green arrow gives me the right of way to make the U-turn. The other side of the intersection"

LLAMA,yelp-218,"Black jeans, grey shirt, black tie and black Chucks. Sounds like something out of every hip GQ man's closet, my closet. As cool as I dress, sorry to disappoint, that's as far as it goes, for me at least. My room is a mess, I'm currently wearing a uniqlo thermal t-shirt and some grey sweatpants. I don't have a ""cool"" job, in fact I'm a pretty boring person. The only ""interesting"" thing about me is that I write about hipsters, which is pretty hipster in itself. It's funny how you can look so good and yet be so boring. I think the only thing more hipster than being a hipster is to be the person who writes about hipsters. Hipsters are the most self-conscious of all people. They walk around in their black Chucks, their black thick-rimmed glasses, and their un-done messy hair. They're self-conscious to the point of being an oxymoron. They're self-conscious about how they don't care about what other people think of them, and their constant struggle to be different from everyone else. Ironically, hipsters want to be unique, but they all want to be unique in the same way. They all want to be unique the same way. They all want to be unique the same way. They all want to be unique the same way. They all want to be unique the same way. They all want to be unique the same way. I'm a hipster, are you? I like your post, but I disagree with you. I think that hipsters are still hipsters, even if they're not hipsters, if that makes sense. The fact that they're hipsters is what makes them not hipsters, right? It's a vicious cycle. Jesus Christ, another hipster blogger. You're right, I'm pretty self-conscious about how I don't care about what other people think of me. It's pretty tough. I am a hipster, am I you? I agree with you. I think hipsters are so self-conscious that they actually care a lot about what other people think of them. I think hipsters are pretty funny, to be honest."

This was just beautifully written - but then it's always been true of his work. Thank you very much for sharing:) This post is really important not only to me personally but also to our community overall as we are entering into another election season. We live in fear based society where things can quickly spiral out of control if anyone dares speak up against anything or someone who holds views different than their own. A big part of why I don't think many see racism outside of their immediate families come back around to themselves being racist too. The current state of affairs has brought forth more awareness now than ever, which is nice though if everyone would use it as motivation to change themselves rather than others first. Please know I appreciate this post immensely!!"

Every thing we had was prepared well, tasty, and a good sized portion. The staff is very attentive, and the place has a great vibe. We don't get down to old town much, but will make this the place for dinner when we do. We prefer the chefs table (Bar) over a table, seems way more fun and hip."

We started with an appetizer of Crispy Scallops served on crackers covered in mayo, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce topped by some crispy olive oil croutons... delish! Next up were Fried Chicken Wings - one for me, one for my hubby - both excellent! Then followed Mashed Potatoes - each portion was perfect size so it wasn't too big nor too small. Waitress brought out side dishes including Roasted Vegetables (my favorite), Brussel Sprouts Carrots and Corn On The Cob. Finally came the dessert, which included Pecan Pie, Strawberry Shortcake, Fat Topped Banana Bread, Apple Crisp, Sugar Cookie Doughnuts, and Homemade Ice Cream Sundae. We have been going to this restaurant every single week since being married in 2003.

Human,yelp-220,"I came here for my girlfriend's Bday dinner. It was just not up to expectations. Our party of 8 wasnt all there, but they seemed to want to keep us at the bar. Finally after 20 minutes, they finally gave in and let the 5 of us sit down since our other few weren't eating. I found this sort of annoying as the bar was pretty full (we were all in heels) and we asked to be seated a few times.... But OOHH well. Server: Our server was pretty darn occupied with the hostesses. I am in the industry, so I understand how this works. But COMMONNN pay attention to us!! The people in our party had to go up to the bar after we were seated because he was so busy trying to meet the ladies!! Food Quality: Mine was decent. I had the filet. I felt the mashed potatoes were missing something, they were dying for truffle or something savory. My steak was a little over cooked. Issue: A girl at our table's steak was WAY undercooked. Our server didnt come around for awhile, so she watched us eat. They re-cooked the same steak to re-cook it. I think this is NASTY. I would expect this at an Applebees, but not here. EW! Dont but a steak that was on a persons germy fork back on the grill!! Prices: For the food quality.... You must be joking! There are much much better places to eat for the same price. Drink Prices: 16-40 for their drinks. Pretty pricey, but they are tasty. I dont think they are very strong, we had two BIG ones and we were still sober afterwards.... 80 for two. They also didnt do ANYTHING for her Bday!! It was a little awkward. I wasn't expecting a song or dance, but a free shot or a comped dessert would have gone a LONG way. Each person in our party left with a 60 tab. I probably wouldnt go back, its just too pricey for the quality in my opinion. I really wouldnt want to repeat that. I did meet a super nice club promoter for the club next door. He really hooked my group of friends up, you can message me for his info if you need it. He really saved the night since dinner was kinda Blah."

To top it off.. another guest got struck by lightning on their way back home from dance floor..... sadly due to weather conditions, i cant comment about what happened next. This place is awesome!!! The entertainment was great every night with DJs playing everything including retro music. They kept things going until 2am! Great prices are very competitive and considered as bargain compared to other places we went to. Food quality is always excellent!! Location- close to downtown Las Vegas yet far enough where it's quiet during non-big event nights. People seem friendly and people watchers Would definitely recommend these guys. Very professional group of dancers who put up a show which held everyone's interest throughout the evening. Great variety in songs too!"
Tsinghua,yelp-220,"I came here for my girlfriend's Bday dinner. It was just not up to expectations. Our party of 8 wasnt all there, but they seemed to want to keep us waiting, when we finally got seated. The food was very disappointing. It was just overcooked and under seasoned. The steak was really dry. We also got 2 pieces of the chinese food. It was just bad. The wait staff was very friendly, but that was it. Service was slow. We ate in the bar, and the bartender kept bringing me water and bringing me the wrong drink. Overall, I would not recommend this place. I will definitely go to a more better restaurant next time I need to celebrate a birthday. We dined at the Riverwalk location for a family dinner. It was a good experience, but not great. The atmosphere was nice, and the food was great. The service was good, but not great. The wait staff was very friendly, and the bartender was a very nice man. We will definitely go back.

LLAMA,yelp-220,"I came here for my girlfriend's Bday dinner. It was just not up to expectations. Our party of 8 wasnt all there, but they seemed to want to keep us from ordering as long as possible. We ordered a bottle of wine, it came later than the 1st course. Our waiter was overworked, and it was obvious that he didn't know what he was doing. It was bad. However, the food was good, but not great. Not sure what the fuss is about. We were so disappointed that we didn't stick around to eat dessert. I would not recommend this place."
OpenAI,yelp-221,"I want to like this place. I have tried extremely hard to like this place. I have gone three times doing lunch, twice with a co-worker and once with my significant other. However, I just can't seem to enjoy the food or the atmosphere here. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach the situation? One approach you can take is to try different dishes on the menu. If you haven't found something you like yet, try exploring other options or ask the server for recommendations. You can also try going at a different time of day or on a different day of the week. If you went for lunch, maybe try dinner or brunch instead. Additionally, you can try to focus on the positive aspects of the restaurant, such as the decor or the service, and try to enjoy those elements. If after trying these approaches, you still can't enjoy the place, it's okay to accept that it's not for you and explore other options. There are plenty of other restaurants out there to try!"

BigScience,yelp-221,"I want to like this place. I have tried extremely hard to like this place. I have gone three times doing lunch, twice with a co-worker and once with my husband (with no children). It has been an hour from the time we left home for work until the end of our two-hour lunch break. The food is always delicious; there are so many choices that it is difficult not to find something you'd love! The service was great on each visit but today's experience just made me hate Napa Valley even more! A few weeks ago, when my friend Lucy hosted her wine tasting party in San Francisco at one of my favorite places - Alinea, I couldn't wait to make another trip to Napa for some French cuisine and beautiful surroundings. Luckily, the weather gods decided against us - they were raining most of the day as well. (When you're traveling by plane or train across America, it's important to understand how less-than-perfect conditions can affect your travel planning!) But luckily we had a glorious sunset over Sonoma Bay ahead of us! I can't say enough about how gorgeous Sonoma County is! (And if you're wondering why I've only written blog posts here since August 2016 and didn't write anything before then... I'm busy now!) We started off breakfast at Willow Tree Farmers Market near Santa Rosa. (Yes, that's right - we're talking avocados all morning!) This little market offers fresh fruit and veggies grown locally with tons of produce info signs around town available to read while browsing through their displays. We also stopped in at the famous Redwood Shores Vintage Village where a number of vintage stores line its main street. There were several amazing antique shops - these definitely help make up for any lack of real estate downtown, which means having plenty of bookstores instead (though those aren't nearly as common). After spending the morning wandering wineries and markets, it was good to settle into a nice cafe for dinner. Throughout the region, restaurants tend to be quite expensive compared to other parts of California. While I don't know exactly what price ranges apply elsewhere in the state (especially Los Angeles), my opinion is based solely upon my recent experiences eating out locally. One night, after trying to figure out exactly where to eat inside a fancy restaurant downtown, we finally found ourselves sitting down outside under the shade of a tree, ordering drinks and enjoying the view! At first glance, I thought ""this looks romantic"" ... but turns out it actually looked a lot worse than it did lovely! So rude hosts and dramatic lighting still seem much better options to me. Slightly disheartened by dining establishments in SonomaNapa, we ended up going for pizza tonight because it seemed cheaper (and probably tastier) than mainstream American cooking anyway For dessert, we went back to Alinea (for the second straight evening in a row!). Although I'd heard mixed reviews online prior to arriving on Friday, these guys really do take care of everyone who visits them. Their menu includes dishes ranging from rice cakes to pasta meatballs to steakhouses... everything is deliciously prepared using quality ingredients, including chef-created starters such as beet salad, house-made mayo and pickled walnuts! On Saturday morning too, we ventured to Alinea again for brunch: juicy burgers, grilled salmon fillets with homemade tzatziki sauce and fresh honey mustard dressing; eggs benedict featuring caramelized sweet potato fries and whipped spinach cream cheese; plus Sushi Chef's selection of sushi rolls along with gyoza, pork skewer and calamari balls. What more could anyone need? Besides being exceptionally friendly staff members and generous desserts, the menu items themselves are literally insanely yummy and healthy. (Along with the fact that you pay between 80-100 per person.) In case you're interested, check out our full review of both venues below! And oh yeah, keep reading for our recommendations ifwhen you decide to try either spot yourself... Almost every single restaurant reviewed here is open exclusively during weekends or weekdays from 4pm-7:30 pm local time. Customers may request delivery via UberEats from certain locations. If staying overnight in one of the numerous vineyards nearby is on your itinerary, remember to factor in additional costs as well: A bottle of wine usually starts around 20-30 USD and increases depending on the store andor production method used. Bribes are never appropriate though! With prices easily starting from 5-10 USD, most grocery stores offer reasonably priced fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the year. Although tipping should be optional overall, especially given the high standards set up by Michelin-starred chefs this country regularly produces, I would recommend giving 15-20 extra cash to Napa State Troopers and Coast Guard personnel stationed within 10 miles of your hotel location. These fine men and women protect people everyday, yet make very small salaries. Thankfully, in addition to helping sustain operations, roughing it for 2-3 days to provide assistance makes Napa more attractive to tourists and locals alike."

The service is terrible, the food is overpriced and the atmosphere is cold. The first time I went, I ordered the fish and chips and my co-worker ordered the burger. The fish and chips were cold and soggy, and the burger was dry and overcooked. The service was also terrible. Our waitress took our orders and then disappeared for over 30 minutes. When she finally came back with our food, it was wrong. She took our food back and then disappeared again for another 15 minutes. When she finally came back with our correct food, it was cold and soggy. The second time I went, I ordered the chicken parmesan and my wife ordered the pasta. The chicken parmesan was dry and overcooked, and the pasta was cold and bland. The service was also terrible. Our waitress took our orders and then disappeared for over 45 minutes. When she finally came back with our food, it was wrong. She took our food back and then disappeared again for another 20 minutes. When she finally came back with our correct food, it was cold and soggy. The third time I went, I decided to give the place one more chance. I ordered the steak and my wife ordered the salmon.

When she finally came back with our food, it was wrong. She took our food back and then disappeared again for another 30 minutes.

Human,yelp-221,"I want to like this place. I have tried extremely hard to like this place. I have gone three times doing lunch, twice with a co-worker and once with my girlfriend. First of all, we all loved the atmosphere. The anime girls serving the food, the little cards, the pictures and anime on the TV are all exceptional. It has all the makings of a very successful ramen house. The problem is the food is simply horrible! I am writing this short review with my stomach in cramps. We have tried between us approximately half a dozen dishes. None of us are really picky eaters either. I had to listen to my girlfriend complain for over a day about how bad the food was and how it upset her stomach. My co-worker swears that he will never go back due either. Some of the seafood in his ramen bad gone bad. I think the place really goes for atmosphere with low quality food to cut costs."
LLAMA,yelp-221,"I want to like this place. I have tried extremely hard to like this place. I have gone three times doing lunch, twice with a co-worker and once with my wife. The first two times I got the very same thing, a chicken panini. The first time it was good, the second time it was not, the third time I got a burger which was decent. The bun was toasted and firm, not like a foam pillow like most places. I was disappointed to find that the cucumber was not pickled, just sliced. I liked the interior which had a vintage flair. Service was good and they have a fun selection of retro candy for sale. You can follow them on Facebook at The Market Street Cafe."

The first time I was seated right away. The second time I was seated after having to wait 15 minutes. The third time I was seated after waiting 15 minutes. The server was very pleasant. I had a salad and a large glass of lemonade. The salad was very good. My husband had a large salad with the soup that I didn't have. I don't know if I have had a bad salad before or what, but this one was awful. The lettuce was so limp and wilted that it had the texture of toilet paper. The only way I could get it to eat was to put the lettuce on the side. The taste was just awful. The soup was great. My husband said it was good, too. So I guess the salad was just really bad. I can't really complain because the salad was free, but it really made me feel like the restaurant was just trying to take advantage of people who are just there for lunch. I will not go back. This was the worst salad I have ever had in my life! I ordered the Blackened Tuna, which I was told was done on a hot grill and it was not! It was like eating fish out of a can! It was horrible! The waiter was very nice and made me another salad, but it was still terrible. I would never go back there again. The portions were huge! I ordered the 2 lb beef burger and my boyfriend ordered the ribeye. We both got our food within a few minutes and it was the best I have ever had. I also had a few drinks and it was a very relaxing meal. I will definitely be back! I have been to many steakhouses in this area and this one is the best by far! I am a vegetarian and I am happy to report that I was able to order a vegetarian option. The staff was very helpful and my order was prepared and brought to me very quickly. The restaurant was a bit small and could use some renovations, but the food was great and the staff was very friendly. The portions were very generous and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely go back. I have eaten at a few different steakhouses and this one is by far the best! I ordered a burger and my boyfriend ordered the ribeye. Both of our burgers were served with french fries and I loved them. My boyfriend loved his too. The steaks were absolutely delicious! The portions were generous and the prices were very reasonable.

I am sorry to hear that you have had a negative experience at the restaurant on your last two visits. It's never a good feeling to see a decrease in quality or service, especially when we have enjoyed something previously. Have you considered leaving a constructive review on the restaurant's social media or review platforms, so that other customers can become aware of the issue and the restaurant can improve? Additionally, if you are comfortable doing so, you may also want to speak with the restaurant management or owner directly to let them know about your experience and give them the opportunity to make it right."
OpenAI,yelp-224,"For Taiwanese style of breakfast. The seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone. Disappointed! I apologize for the disappointing experience you had with the sesame baked bun. I understand how frustrating it can be to receive food that doesn't meet your expectations. If it's possible, you should bring the issue to the attention of the restaurant or establishment where you purchased the bun. They may be able to provide you with a refund or a replacement, or even address the issue with their baking process to prevent it from happening again in the future. In the meantime, if you'd like to enjoy Taiwanese-style breakfast, I suggest trying some other popular breakfast items like Congee, Jianbing (Chinese crepes), or savory soy milk. Don't let one disappointing encounter discourage you from exploring more of the cuisine."
BigScience,yelp-224,"For Taiwanese style of breakfast. The seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone. Disappointed! - I thought it was really good and I enjoyed the steamed broccoli with its sweetness, fried tofu had nice flavor but the garlic sauce was boring. The group breakfast at Wing Hwa was very disappointing. Although we ordered our usual items (including one dish that we didn't like), they kept changing dishes every other day for about 3 months straight... so we never saw what we were ordering first time around. We started off super excited because we got our starters from the Noodle House of Japan table. (Foods in red on photo) First up: Sushi roll which arrived cold and not yet cooked. Not even enough water left to cook rice after putting sushi together. Next came the smoked salmon poke bowl (or something similar) - everything looked okay though definitely not my favorite. Then there was this huge plate of beautiful looking ""eggs"" that turned out to be Japanese pancake mixes covered with some egg yolk stuff. Finally we ended up getting rolls made by putting shirasu noodles into different shapes - again pretty simple however fresh! It seems like all these photos are taken over 6 months apart. It's hard to believe it's been almost two years since we've last eaten here... Wonderful service, amazing food great atmosphere. Awesome options too...some Chinese others Western. We will surely come back more often!! Thank you!! This place has an awesome atmosphere!!! They make your own plates, no chopsticks or utensils needed.. just eat right out of them:). Great location, close to Chinatown alleyways, lots of parking available if you're staying downtown! At least this place still offers authentic Asian cuisine despite being looong goneclosed down.

This review will not get into too much detail about each segment because I find it difficult reviewing something when there isn't an obvious bad critique or good point in my mind (last year's Alegria was similar) but instead give some overall thoughts on what made me enjoy our experience thoroughly!"
BigScience,yelp-225,"One of the few Cirque du Soleil that follow a story line, so if you are looking for a Cirque du Soleil show and a story this is the one to go see. The dreamlike visuals coupled with good choreography it all makes up an experience like no other. This sets in the '70s so expect some driving cars at times. I think we went on touring car rides but it's not clear from my memory how many there were...maybe 3-4? That's about what they would do during the day time."
LLAMA,yelp-225,"One of the few Cirque du Soleil that follow a story line, so if you are looking for a Cirque du Soleil show and a story this is the one. The story is based on the life of a young man who falls in love with a woman. He later discovers that the woman has died and gone to the ""Land of the Dead"" and he sets out to bring her back to life. The show was very enjoyable and not at all scary. In fact there were children in the audience that were not scared. It was more funny and entertaining. The stage design was amazing. The stage was a cathedral with a stairway from the top to the stage. At times there are these giant angel wings that expand from the sides of the stage. The angels appear to have a wingspan of over 20 feet. A lot of the acts that are in this show are very similar to other Cirque du Soleil shows. There is a very nice act with a couple who climb up a rope together and then do several tricks while suspended from the rope. The music was very moving and the cathedral setting added to the experience. I have been to all of the Las Vegas Cirque du Soleil shows and I would rate this one as my 3rd favorite after O and Love. The show is about 90 minutes long with no intermission. There is a theater selling snacks and drinks before the show."
PaLM,yelp-225,"One of the few Cirque du Soleil that follow a story line, so if you are looking for a Cirque du Soleil show and a story this is the one. Based on the life of a French mime who was the star of the show. He was a young man from a poor family who was apprenticed to a mime, and through hard work and dedication became one of the most famous mimes in the world. The show follows the mime from his early days of poverty and obscurity to his rise to fame and fortune. We see him perform in the streets of Paris, in the palaces of the rich and famous, and even in the circus. We see him fall in love, have children, and grow old. The show is a celebration of the human spirit, and the power of art to transform lives. It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope."

The Red and the Blue In the center of the stadium you can find two seats that allow you to see all the show from both sides. The Red side is a 2015 set while the Blue side is a 2017 set. The show starts in the middle of the stage and the story follows a pair of Red and Blue robots that fight to save the world. 6. The Golden Gate Bridge As soon as you enter the stadium, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is a symbol of San Francisco and the location where the show takes place. 7. Sea and Sky Once you leave the stadium, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge and then walk to the left and you will see the ocean and then the sky. This is a beautiful view and the perfect way to end the show. 8. The Carnivores The Carnivores are the robots in the show and they are made of metal. They are very realistic and you can see how the artists put their hands into the metal. 9. The Story The story of the show follows two robots who are fighting to save the world from the darkness. The robots are made of metal and you can see how the artists put their hands into the metal. 10. The Projections The show has 110 projection screens that allow you to see amazing images. The screens are a bit smaller than in most Cirque du Soleil shows, but they are not small enough to make the show boring. 11. The Light Show The light show is one of the best parts of the show. The lights are a bit dim, but they make the show look great. You will not be able to see the projection screens, but you will be able to see everything else. 12. The Sound The sound is another part of the show that is great. You can feel the energy in the show and the sound does not take away from the energy of the show. 13. The Costumes The costumes of the show are made of metal, but they look very beautiful. The costumes are not only made of metal, but they are also made of leather and the costumes are also made of feathers. 14. The Music The music of the show is very nice and you can feel the energy of the show. The music does not take away from the energy of the show, but it does add to it. 15. The Robots The robots of the show are made of metal, but they look very beautiful. The robots are not only made of metal, but they are also made of leather and the costumes are also made of feathers. 16. The Movement The movement of the show is great. The show has many tricks and the movement of the robots is very interesting. 17. The Visual Effects The visual effects of the show are great. The show has a lot of energy and you can feel it with the visuals. 18. The Lighting The lighting of the show is also great. The show has a lot of lights and the lighting makes the show look very interesting. 19. The Orchestra The orchestra of the show is a small orchestra and they play a very nice music. The music of the show is great and you can feel the energy of the show. 20. The Energy The energy of the show is great. The show has a lot of energy and the energy is something that makes the show very good. The show is amazing and if you want to see something amazing, this is the show for you. If you want to see a Cirque du Soleil show, you have to go to The Golden Gate Arena. This is a very good show and if you are looking for a Cirque du Soleil show with a story, this is the show for you. 3 Responses to ""What to Do in San Francisco"" Nice post.

Although it strays a bit from the traditional style of Cirque du Soleil, it is still sure to please. We were fortunate enough to be able to purchase front section tickets for 50 off AMAZING deal! (End of summer special). KA is the show which it is the stage that is at the center of attention. It uses a sectional stage that is fully mobile it rotates and moves on a 3D axis it really adds another level of excitement to the show. I would not recommend this as anyone's first Cirque du Soleil show but for a any repeat or veteran Cirque du Soleil viewer this must make it onto your Seen it list."
BigScience,yelp-226,"I think this Mexican restaurantsports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss. When I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the back so I decided to wait for them out front and then come inside. The place has a good vibe with lots of tables on both floors as well as outdoor seating right at the waterfront. The decor is clean and modern (almost post-industrial) with dark wood walls that contrast beautifully against the white beige counter tops high ceilings. A little light music starts playing from time to time which adds some atmosphere to what could have been an otherwise bland spot. As soon as you walk into the restaurant though it's clear business doesn't seem particularly busy - we were one of only three people sitting outside when we arrived! And it didn't even look like they had many customers coming through until about 6pm or so. My friend ordered several margaritas while I settled down to try their taco plate selection over a bowl of rice. The menu boasts burritos, enchiladas, fajita plates, quesadillas (including vegetarian options), nachos, wraps, tacos, fish tacos, salads, bowls and more! We started off our meal by sharing two fresh oysters over blackened chips served alongside salsa verde sauce (yum!) My friend went ahead and tried her first ever shrimp dish called ""Del Mar...""for those not up on seafood vocabulary, Del Mar means Seafood. Overall my experience here wasn't bad considering I'm pretty picky when it comes to mexican food. But I'd say if you're looking for something new (or different) than ""Mexican restaurant sports bar"" that's just fine too Holy cow did this burger deserve an entire post all its own!! After literally eating 5 years of Pizza Hut Fries before moving to California last year..it's always nice having a variety of healthy fast food options around now:).

LLAMA,yelp-226,"I think this Mexican restaurantsports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss. When I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the bar area which was fine. However, the hostess was not around to seat guests so I sat down. I was very patient and a few minutes later a waitress came over and asked if I was waiting for a table. I said yes and she said she would be right over. I was hoping to sit at the bar, but she sat me at a small table in the middle of the dining room. The dining room was very cold, so I got up to move to the bar area and it was warmer. I was very thirsty, so I ordered a house margarita. I waited 10 minutes and when it arrived, it was a rocks margarita and not a house margarita. I said that is not what I ordered and she said she would fix it. The house margarita arrived about 10 minutes later and it was very tasty. I also ordered a basket of chips and salsa. It took 10 minutes for the chips to arrive and another 5 minutes for the salsa to arrive. When I ordered my food, I asked for a cheese enchilada, beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada with rice and beans. I ordered this because I wanted to sample different things and it was not a lot of food. The server said she would be right back with my food. 15 minutes later, my food arrived and it was the wrong order. I ordered a chicken enchilada with beef and cheese enchiladas. It arrived as a beef enchilada with chicken and cheese enchiladas. I asked if the chicken was cooked separately and she said yes. I said I was not interested in the beef enchilada. I asked to see the manager and she said she would be right over. A few minutes later, the manager came over. I explained the situation and she said there would not be any charge for the beef enchilada. I said I am not interested in the beef enchilada and she said that is all she could do. I ate the food and it was very good. I finished my food and it was time to pay my check. I asked for my check and she said she would be right over. It took a few minutes and the check arrived. I then asked for the check with my credit card and she said she would be right over. She said the same thing 5 minutes later. Finally, I just got up and went to the register to pay the check. It is a shame this place does not understand customer service. I met a friend for dinner at the Taco Bell Cantina located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. This restaurant is a hybrid between the traditional Taco Bell and the Taco Bell Cantina. The traditional Taco Bell Cantina is a counter service restaurant where you can order beer, wine, and alcoholic frozen drinks. The Taco Bell Cantina at 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard South is a counter service restaurant and a waiter service restaurant. When I arrived, I was looking for the counter to place my order, but I could not find it. I then asked the hostess where the counter was and she said there was not a counter and I would have to be seated. I was seated at a very nice table and the waitress took my order. I ordered the Cantina Power Menu which consisted of a beefy 5 layer burrito, crunch wrap, and taco supreme. The waitress brought the food out and it was very good. The beefy 5 layer burrito is loaded with beef, rice, beans, and sour cream. The crunch wrap was delicious and the taco supreme was very good. The Taco Bell Cantina is a must try when you are in Las Vegas. The food is good and the alcoholic frozen drinks are fantastic. I went to the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas on Saturday to watch a hockey game. I was hoping to get a table at the Grand Cafe, but there was a long wait. I then decided to eat at the Saloon. The Saloon is a steakhouse and the prices are very affordable. I ordered the 10 oz. Prime Rib, a house salad, and potatoes au gratin. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the house salad was very good. The potatoes au gratin were also very good. I had a very good meal"

Human,yelp-226,"I think this Mexican restaurantsports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss. When I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the immediate barroom to the right of the entrance. If I remember accurately, there were about 3 TVs at the bar in there. The crowd here is a little bit older, but everyone looked like they were there to have a great time - MILFs, DILFs, and cougars included. I went up to the host stand where I waited for almost 5 minutes. Many servers walked by, but no one bothered to help, or tell me someone was on their way to seat me. Once I did sit down, I waited for about 15 minutes for my friend without being greeted by a server. Once she arrived, we waited another 20 minutes before my friend went to grab a waitress. The waitress apologized and told us she didn't realize she had our table as well. I've worked in a few restaurants through college - long enough to know that things sometimes get mixed up, but when you have a table waiting without food our drinks for 30 minutes, you should probably go ask them if they need any help! The food isn't worth talking about, so I won't."

My chorizo omelet came out as more of a scramble than the cheesy kind you might get at Sizzler that evening. The drinks menu is pretty basic - lots of coffee options (including lattes), sodas, beer, wine and some cocktails. I got an espresso martini because I'm not really into tequila-based drinks; my boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary instead to satisfy his sweet tooth. I loved this place so much! The service was super friendly with helpful advice for our meal (breakfast sandwiches? Yes please!) As far as quality goes, there wasn't 1 thing about our breakfast we didnt like! We will be back again soon!! Definitely recommend checking them out if you're looking for a cozy breakfast spot in West Hollywood 2) They had quite a few rooms but they didn't seem very busy - maybe weddings runs through their weekend? 4) Breakfast was good- whole wheat waffles with all kinds of tasty eatables on top. But...the eggs were cold and hard, just like when you go to McDonalds... 5) Free Wifi worked well on both laptops phones. Maybe tablets would work better since the room is small.. 6) If you're going in early morning hours, ask staff members around 2am-3am to see if they can open your door before 5:30 am so that you don't have to wait until 6.30am, which happens sometimes depending on who's cleaning after guests leave. (If you want clean towels, ask for those too). 7) Staff were nice enough, especially one girl called Jessica - she helped me order some breakfast items from the counter. Definitely recommend her"

The gravy was pretty good actually; thick enough without going too heavy handed over everything including your breakfast toast (I had mine dry). Had my coffee black again because why?

Tsinghua,yelp-227,"Blueberry Hill serves up completely average diner food. It has it's purpose, though, and it makes great late-night or hangover food. My chorizo omelet came out as more of a thick pancake than an omelet. The house-made salsa on top was surprisingly good, but I wish the toppings had more depth. It would have been a lot better with a side of avocado and tomatoes. I'd recommend going for the cinnamon rolls or smothered fries (or both). The prices are very reasonable and you can easily eat for less than 10. But it's the real deal. You can go back for a second meal. This is the perfect place to have a date night. I don't think you'll ever want to leave. I don't think it's the best restaurant in the world, but it's a good restaurant, and it's cheap. I'd say it's somewhere between a decent restaurant and a hole in the wall, but it's definitely not a hole in the wall. Blueberry Hill is definitely not a tourist trap. There are no tourists there. It's a neighborhood restaurant."

My chorizo omelet came out as more of a giant chorizo and egg sandwich, but it was still pretty good. One thing I've noticed about this place: the food is hit or miss. It depends a lot on the cooks and how busy they are. If the place is packed and the cooks are backed up, the food can get a bit soggy, cold, and generally not too good. Our waitress was one of the nicest, most attentive waitresses I've ever had. She even brought me a free coffee refill with my meal and let me know that she didn't charge me for it. That was sweet. Other than that, I really can't think of much to say about the place. The service is nice, the food is average, and the prices are fair. I'm giving it 3 stars.

They have a nice little menu with a lot of variety, from egg dishes to breakfast sandwiches to traditional country breakfasts. They even have a grits and eggs option. Their eggs are always good and cooked properly, their sausage is a bit on the bland side. The biscuits are good. Copper Penny has been around forever, and it's probably a staple of Charleston breakfast. I'm giving it 3.5 stars.

Pleasant that specializes in, you guessed it, baked goods. They also serve breakfast and lunch. I've only eaten there once. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and some sort of casserole. The pulled pork was delicious, and I'm not even a fan of pulled pork. I'm guessing it was from a whole pig, because it had a little bit of every part of the pig. The casserole was a little bland and uninteresting. I did not have a chance to try their baked goods, but I hear they're awesome.

Tsinghua,yelp-229,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was. The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. It had a good amount of parsley and mint, and some spices to add flavor to the sandwich. The next time I had a falafel burger and I really liked it. It had a good amount of spices and flavoring on the inside. It was soft and juicy, and had a great texture. It was not too big or too small, just right. I also liked the fact that they had different flavors of falafel, like a spicy one, and a plain one. It is good to know that they have flavors for different tastes. They also have a wide variety of falafel sandwiches, burgers, and wraps. Overall, I would definitely recommend it. I think it is a great place to eat and would go back. I would also recommend it to friends and family, because I know they will enjoy it as well. I went to the local McDonald's to pick up a sandwich to take to my job, as it was going to be a long day. I went in and ordered my sandwich, and was greeted by a friendly, pleasant looking employee. She brought my sandwich out to me, and was very helpful and pleasant as she walked me through the process of how to eat it. She was also very friendly as she spoke to me. I felt very welcome and at home, as I was sitting at a table. It is very refreshing to have a McDonald's that is friendly and welcoming. The place was very clean and neat, and the employees were very friendly. It is a place that I will definitely return to, and recommend to others. I went to a McDonald's to buy a hot dog and a soda. The place was very clean and neat, and the employees were very friendly and welcoming. The hot dog I got was a really good hot dog. It was big and meaty, and had some seasonings on it. The soda I got was a Diet Pepsi, and was very good. It had a little bit of a sweet taste to it, and was soft. I would recommend this McDonald's to others, as it is a great place to go. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because I did not feel very welcomed. I was greeted by a person who was not friendly or nice. I do not think that it was the employees fault that they did not seem friendly, as the place was very clean and neat. The employees were very friendly and helpful."
Human,yelp-229,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was. The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside. The second time I had the gyro platter, which is a mound of shaved gyro meat, pita wedges, jasmine rice and a Greek salad. It was all great, right down to the Tzatziki You might balk at 9 but it's a huge meal, definitely worth it. I also suggest the flavored iced teas that they have. Really, it was all amazing. You could pick this place up and put it in any city and it would fit right in."
OpenAI,yelp-229,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was. The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside yet moist and flavorful on the inside. The second time I tried their lamb kebab platter and it was tender and juicy with just the right amount of seasoning. If you are looking for a recommendation, I would suggest trying anything from their grill menu as it's always fresh and delicious. Another popular dish amongst regulars is the chicken shawarma, which is reportedly very tender and flavorful. And don't forget to save room for their homemade baklava for dessert!"
PaLM,yelp-229,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was. The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside. The hummus was also really good, and the pita bread was fresh and warm. The second time I went I had the chicken shawarma and it was also delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was flavorful and tangy. The fries were also really good, and the service was excellent. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant."
BigScience,yelp-229,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was. The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on one side but still soft inside with a creamy tzatziki sauce, which came out hot from the pita bread. My husband ordered an eggplant dish that was just beautiful in every way; crispy skin, juicy tomato filling coated with tahini and then topped off by a generous drizzle of olive oil. These are not your usual fast food joints or paved over restaurant meals where you can only have dessert after dinner (and even that is pretty limited). These are authentic Middle Eastern dishes only served until midnight for lunchtime diners who want something lighter than their evening meal."

The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on a toasted pita with lettuce, tomatocucumber slices (or pickle), red onion tzatziki sauce - to die for! This trip my wife ordered that same thing again so we could compare but she said they used too much oil in frying them this go around even though her last one came out perfect as well..she also tried their burger which is usually fantastic made without mayo or anything else like bacon etc....well guess what? This version has BACON!! Yuck...and very little flavor because of all those greasy ingredients added; no wonder half way through you can't really taste any flavors anymore.....the whole experience sucked majorly especially since our previous order didn't have either ingredient making us think 1st off something went wrong then 2nd when your eating fresh food shouldn' be possible if its going bad before served.

Tsinghua,yelp-231,"They are AWESOME! Tammie the owner and her awesome assistant walked me through buying, having and maintaining chickens. I bought my chicken coop, a couple chicks, organic feed, water food, and lots of tools and accessories. She and her assistant are so helpful, friendly, and super sweet! She even gave me a coupon for free feed with every order. AWESOME. I'm a convert. Chickens are a great way to get back into homesteading. I've always wanted chickens, but I didn't know how to go about it. Now I do. I'm a big fan of chickens. They have always been my favorite pets. I have had pets of all kinds over the years. My very first was a cocker spaniel puppy. He was a little terror and when he was around, I was never allowed to play with my friends. He would bite them. I don't know why he would do that, but I don't think he ever learned to back off. He was a handful and we had to put him down when he was around 10 years old. I'm sure he was in pain. The next dog I had was a Rottweiler. He was a beautiful dog. He was black and white and I loved him so much. He was a good dog, but he was aggressive with people and other dogs. He was a very good guard dog and he was a good watchdog. He loved me and he was loyal. Unfortunately, he died from cancer when he was 12 years old. The next dog I had was a large pit bull. He was very protective of me and he was a good dog. He was a good watchdog and a good guard dog. He loved to play fetch and he was a great friend. Unfortunately, he died from cancer when he was around 10 years old. I've always loved dogs, but the ones I had before these were just not good for me. They were too aggressive and they were too big. I couldn't have one that big as a pet. They were too dangerous. They would attack people and other dogs. I was always scared of them. I still am. When I had my dog, Bailey, she was smaller than these dogs and she was very sweet and very gentle. She was never aggressive with anyone. She was a good dog. She was always by my side. She was the best dog I ever had. She was a great dog. She was the best. I miss her so much. She was my best friend. I know she's in heaven with Jesus. I hope I see her again someday. That's my dog story. My current dog is a boxer. He is sweet, gentle, loving, and a great friend. He loves to play and he is a great guard dog. He's my little buddy and he's my buddy. I'm not sure if he will live forever, but he's my buddy for now. I hope he lives forever. My husband and I have 2 more dogs that are awaiting their homes. They are also sweet, loving, gentle, and great friends. We have 2 more boxers. They are our newest pets. They are only 6 weeks old. They are adorable. We've named them Buddy and Boo. They're cute and we love them. I'm looking forward to watching them grow up. I hope they live a long life. I love them so much. I know they're going to be great dogs. I'm excited about it. I love all dogs, but I'm a huge dog lover. I'm a huge fan of dogs. I'm a big fan of chickens. I've always wanted chickens. I've always wanted to get chickens, but I didn't know how to go about it. Now I do. I'm a big fan of chickens. I've always wanted chickens. I've always wanted to get chickens, but I didn't know how to go about it. Now I do. I'm a big fan of chickens.

There's no cars or people anywhere near us other than maybe 10 miles away from where we are sitting, (that would be one cabin down). You can see that there's only one street running across the middle of town with lights in front of every building along that road. There are also signs saying ""No parking"" everywhere you look! The room was really nice; everything's clean and tidy as could be expected for a 4 star hotel! And although I had looked forward to having my own bathroom, I didn't realize how nice they were until now! They even let you keep your own towels too! (Thank goodness!)

Human,yelp-234,"I called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tires with an out the door price including mounting and balancing. Purcell quoted less expensive than the rest. I agreed, made an appointment and they ordered the tires. When I got there they tried to sell me the scam tire insurance (It only adds replacement coverage for the 2 of punctures which are not repairable, and only at their chain) and I declined. The price which I was quoted was not the price I paid. They had two individual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and added a materials fee. It was about 70.00 over the out the door price, which became more expensive the last time I purchased identical tires elsewhere and competitor's phone quotes. They opened my hood and poked around while I was not present without my permission, then tried to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire. There is NO reason to open my hood during a tire transaction. It took almost two hours to change four tires despite an appointment and not being busy. This week I got a coupon in the mail, since they also added me to their mailing list without asking. I won't be using it. I'll give them some credit, though- they didn't take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work. There is obviously a reason why business is slow for this shop when the scammable ASU students are away and why they have no reputation on Yelp. I gave two stars because the product itself is what I asked for and they were installed properly. They did do something right."

Eleuther-AI,yelp-235,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been my favorite. With an upcoming Mother's Day celebration on Sunday and Father's day just around corner (if you know me at all), it is safe for anyone in your life who likes burritos or anything else involving beans of any kind- give them with love! The recipe below was created out from some ideas thrown together after running into these two ingredients: LENTILS AND CORN CHIPS AT THE GROCERY STORE!!! As soon as we walked through our front door Ben went right up north checking if they had both items available....we found lentils but no corn chips...so he headed back home where there were NO more chip options so continued his quest until finding fresh tortillas.....and then called us asking what combination sounded good?!? We suggested mixing things like black bean soup recipes along side crisp pico de gallo salsa......that led him down south again looking once last time since driving would be cheaper than gas toll prices!! He finally came across masa harina locally made cornbread mix......which became part one ingredient needed!!!! The other being lime juice........then dinner could begin:) It turned quite enjoyable; adding Springy green onions, cilantro leaves drying off instead rolling under water towels due inside air conditioning unit (I have learned better now); lots cooking throughout progress too because when using those nonstick cookware pieces aka ""advance oven..""you must flip often otherwise end result will turn burnt: (This definitely wasn't something tasted warm freshly microwaved either only minutes later...it still seemed pretty dry compared lol! And even though eggless cookie dough didn t work well without milk mixed directly onto pan surface....this idea did:) .............. Despite having plenty left over cooked veggies 34 cup sweet potato 1 red bell pepper shredded cabbage 2 cups lettuce 4 tomatoes diced avocado washed extra cucumber squeezed lemon juiced per serving size suggestion within nutrition facts section:O sorry none saved today. But crispy vegetable strips added afterwards worked great!!!!!!!! Bringing flavorful crunchiness factor plus tenderizing whole grains mixture make sure onion peels are discarded before placing everything aside covered refrigerated till morning buyout option;) Besides many people do enjoy savory salads prepared ahead anyway!! Our family rather enjoys leaving nothing behind except empty plates LOL?"

However, I have found that when I do go out to eat, I usually find myself disappointed with the quality of the food and service. This was the case when I went to Los Portales last week. The restaurant was crowded when we arrived, but we were seated right away. The menu was extensive, and we had a hard time deciding what to order. We finally settled on two enchiladas and a taco. The food came out quickly, but it was cold and bland. The enchiladas were soggy, and the taco was dry. The service was also poor. The waiter was rude and inattentive. He never refilled our drinks, and he took our order wrong. We left Los Portales feeling disappointed and hungry. We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Tsinghua,yelp-235,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been one of my favorites. The following review is my opinion, and I will share some personal details about my dining experience. The restaurant was very nice, with nice friendly service, nice decor and a nice atmosphere. I had the restaurant to celebrate a wedding anniversary, and we were seated at a small table near the window, and our waiter took our drink order. The drinks came pretty quickly, and the waiter was very pleasant. The menu is an extensive one, with all the standard Mexican food items, as well as a few twists on the traditional Mexican dishes. I ordered the Tacos Espanolas with Chorizo, Salsa Verde, and Cilantro. The server brought the tacos out with a basket of hot chips. I must say, that the food was amazing. The salsa verde was really good, and it complemented the other flavors of the taco very well. The chips were really fresh and crunchy, and I couldn't get enough of them. I really liked the chorizo, and it tasted really good. The tortillas were very fresh, and they were big and crispy, but not too crispy, so they were still soft. I would definitely recommend the tacos eslovacas, but make sure to get some chips. If you order the tacos, try the tacos with Chorizo. I had the Nachos Grandes, which were very good. They had a nice salsa on them, and they were served with fresh chips. I would order the nachos again. I have to say that I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was a nice, quiet atmosphere, with just a few other people in the restaurant. I really liked the fact that the restaurant was not crowded, and that it was very quiet. It felt very intimate. The wait staff was very friendly, and they really knew their stuff. They took the time to make sure that the food was cooked just right, and it was served hot. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone who wants a nice Mexican restaurant experience."
LLAMA,yelp-235,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been a favorite of mine. So what started out as an innocent stop at a Mexican restaurant near our house turned into the biggest disappointment I've had in quite some time. I have to say that I think this place was a front for a marijuana distribution operation, seriously. I am almost 100 positive. Here are the facts that I observed: It's in a small strip mall that looks like it hasn't been renovated since the 80's The inside of the restaurant is dark, with dark wood, and looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the 80's The chips and salsa, which were brought to us when we sat down, were both stale When I ordered a drink, the waiter looked at me with a blank stare and said, ""we don't have that"" I went to the restroom and the restroom was as old and decrepit as the rest of the place Our food came to us late and it was pretty horrible. The ""guacamole"" was made with tomato sauce instead of actual avocadoes, and was served on a paper plate My wife ordered ""mole"" which was actually served in a small crock pot. The mole wasn't very good and the crock pot was definitely not clean The ""sour cream"" was a spoonful of whipping cream. The ""cheese"" in my dish was straight from a can. The waiter gave us our check and then disappeared for 30 minutes before returning to ask if we were ready to pay. I don't think I need to go on and on, but I just thought I'd share my experience. Has anyone else had any horrible restaurant experiences? Mexican Food in Orlando"
BigScience,yelp-235,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been one of my favorites. However it is just so... well, you know. I went with friends for lunch and we made our way through quite an assortment of tacos before settling on these Baja Chorizo Tacos. Now I don't think they were any different than other taquitos I've had in the past however there was something about them that seemed right somehow. The chorizo? Well, it's good but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to order those again (although when they're sold as part of one dish that's another story). But anyway back to these taquerias. These Taquitos are meant to be eaten warm from their griddle pan because once cold or hot outside, your taste buds can't tell what you've got between your lips anymore (unless you're really adventurous like me). 2) In medium bowl combine corn tortillas, shredded cabbage, green chili powder, lime juice, and salt until combined. (If your mixture seems too wet add some more lime juice) 3) Heat oil over medhigh heat in large skillet set aside. Add 2 tablespoons batter at a time into heated skillet allowing each piece to cook 1 minute per side or until golden brown on both sides then flip and let finish cooking another 1-2 minutes. (Note: If using frozen chicken breast cut into cubes will work fine as long as thawed completely first.) As far as I'm concerned all kinds of rice works perfectly here! This recipe serves up 4 people easily though if you'd prefer to serve only 3... Place shrimp into skillet; add garlic clove; sprinkle salt pepper over top. Cook 5-7 minutes or until shrimp turn pink inside. Remove skillet from burner."
Human,yelp-235,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been one of my favorites, but if your going to open a Mexican food joint in AZ you better be on point... My sister and I went here on the advice of some friends, the restaurant was clean, the service was good, we were seated immediately, we basically had our choice of seats because the restaurant was empty, literally empty. They brought out the chips and salsa, this to me an important first impression for any good Mexican food restaurant, if your trying to claim that you make great Mexican your salsa better be awesome, it wasn't...they offered three different kinds, a mild with corn, black bean, and tomato, that pretty much all looked and tasted like they came out of a can, a green that was decent, and a red salsa that was really watery, the flavor was okay but the consistency was really watered down and not terribly appealing. At least the chips were fresh, like I said at this point I'm still looking for things to like lol. I ordered the Farmers Burrito with the adovada pork, our waitress said that anything with the pork was awesome. It wasn't terrible (thus the two stars) it was just really bland, the pork tasted a lot like something my grandma would make in a crock pot (sorry grandma lol) but you know what I'm saying, just very bland, it had tomatoes, corn, and cheese in it also, I think it was just their mild salsa which again kind of tasted to me like it came of a can. My sister had the taco salad, also with the adovado pork and it was also very bland, even the dressing which was supposed to be some kind of a pablano ranch dressing just didn't have much flavor. and tasted more like lettuce than anything else. Mexican food has long been one of my favorites because it lends itself to great flavors, more than just spice, but great southwestern flavor, in my opinion La Ristra just missed the mark. I'm surprised by the other reviews on here, and maybe they were just having an off day, but I'm not sure I'll be back to find out. I hope they improve, I love small businesses, and never want to see anybody fail but a Mexican Food joint in this market better be killing it, and this just didn't do it for me..."

I had the parm chicken sandwich that I thought might be a little overdone (I don't normally prefer my meat cooked too well) But enjoyed it anyway and would like to come back in here again. Friendly staff, great service! We ordered the house specials which included, an appetizer platter with shrimp empanadas, calamari, bacon wrapped cod fish fillets and mini crab cakes to start off. Then as our entrees we selected Beef Short Ribs from scratch, Olive Oil Garlic Fries and Braised Short Ribs for us both. After dinner shared dessert of three kinds including a cinnamon roll filled with fresh whipped cream. Overall this is one of my favorite spots in Charleston! The menu at Mindful has some amazing choices and they always seem to have vegetarian friendly options. This particular week there were different salads on the menu so I decided to try their Pink Himalayan Salt Shrimp Salad; I also added another veggie option - some steamed spinach. My husband chose Chicken Supreme with bites of chicken breast seasoned with black pepper and white wine sauce while my kids went with Cashew Avocado Toast minus the avocado. Aside from these two main course items all food came out hot and delicious! It's been difficult in recent years to find places where you can eat healthy meals without sacrificing taste or value. Quite frankly when you're walking around downtown Charleston it's not easy finding interesting dishes that aren't loaded down with fatty ingredients...but Mindfulness gave me just what I'm looking for: tasty portions served up by helpful people who know what they're doing."

It was ok I felt that the ham was a bit to tough for me it should of been tender and thin sliced. The mozzarella and basil was the best part of the sandwich oh and was not warm enough. My cousin had the eggplant dish. She said it was actually good it looked good to. another problem we had here was that they did not have bread. You need bread some meals. We asked for some and I think they ran to bashas and bought an old baguette. they cut a piece off and then cut that into fours it was cold and stale. So overall I think its too pricey just for lunch food was ok the service was great. Thats why I give this place a 2. just because its in Verrado doesnt mean it deserves another star.

BigScience,yelp-238,"Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I asked to wash my hands before eating..they said they just need paper towels....I don't know if there's a difference between paper towels (which are not hardy enough) and soap? According to the manager she'd have brought one or two extra plates but didn't see any cleaning cloths anywhere...then went back into dining area to ask what we should do as there wasn't anything special that needed done!? When it comes up again I'll be checking with managers how they're handling things We really enjoyed our lunch at the Indian Cafe on Thursday. The food was excellent - hot steamed veggies, kababs, samosas, chicken tikka masala etc all cooked well served piping hot. The staff were very helpful in recommending places nearby where we could obtain drinks, which made an otherwise dull day much more enjoyable! I've been coming to the Cafe Indian week after week since 2003 and it's never let me down. We usually sit outside on Friday night so you can watch the cricket matches from inside the cafe. Never had a bad meal and always found great value for money. Dear Client, Thank You for taking time out to leave us your feedback regarding your recent stay here at the Indulge Hotel. I am pleased to hear you enjoyed your visit to our hotel and your meals. It has taken some time to read through your entire comments however I would like to take this opportunity to thank you once again for choosing to utilize our services during your short break. Your kind words mean a lot to me, especially seeing them come directly from such a valued customer. Please pass along to those who work behind the scenes that appreciate their efforts everyday whether big or small. Thank-you once again and I hope that we will welcome you back soon. Kind Regards, Team Jackpot Hotel Management This place isn't cheap,but its worth every penny I've spent here. Asian cuisine,with spices used in abundance,stir-fries topped off with fresh chilli paste,a mix of flavours tastes overly sweet only because they're too full.Healthily delicious though.If you're looking for good Thai curry shop around,the Brahms is better quality and cheaper than this Chinese thai. Sokay's - Tomato Basil Chicken Curry - Not nice. It's tasteless and doesn't try to improve with cooking. They use quite a lot of coconut milk also. Nothing even close to authentic thai style curry sauce. Go somewhere else... Wonderful location right next to the seafront. Nice pricequality ratio. From 9am till 10pm you get a local cafe serving classic Thai dishes as well as pizzas, pasta dishes and hamburgers. Very popular among locals; prices are reasonable although ingredients may vary depending on seasonality. Be warned that most items including alcoholic drinks cannot be ordered online other then beer which seems to be reasonably priced. Like the fact that it's located near beach, and quiet despite being within walking distance from main street where lots of restaurants and bars abound. Price wise competitive. Friendly service by young lady working alone. Breakfast menu rich (although not extensive). Rooms are suitable for city guests with 2 beds each. Check-in took longer than expected due to few people staying. Other than that nothing negative to say except maybe lackluster decoration and relatively old furniture. Location convenient: 15 min walk from BTS station Bangla Road, 30 mts walking distance from Namtoon Beach.

OpenAI,yelp-238,"Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I'm sorry to hear that your experience with the food wasn't great, but I appreciate your feedback about the cleanliness of the restaurant. As a helpful assistant, I suggest bringing this up to the manager or owner of the restaurant so they can address any cleaning concerns and work on improving the overall experience for their customers. Alternatively, you could leave a review online or speak to customer service to voice your concerns."

This place needs better managementcleaning staff (and maybe one more person behind counter)"
Tsinghua,yelp-238,"Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I came in, the place was filthy. Dirty dishes, dirty utensils, dirty tables, and dirty dishes in the sink. The waitress did not know how to clean the dishes. I'm not even sure she was washing them. She just threw them in the sink and left them there. If you want to eat here, come at night when the kitchen staff is gone. Then, it'll be clean. Good food and service! This is a very nice restaurant. Service was excellent and the food was wonderful. We will definitely go back and eat there again. We had a 10:00 reservation and were seated promptly. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. The food was excellent. We were very satisfied. Food was really good and the service was excellent. They were very friendly and helpful. They did not overcharge us for anything and they gave us the option of getting the food in or out. It was very good. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but this place has some of the best food around. You'll find a lot of other good Thai places in the area, but this is by far the best. If you want to try the best, this is the place to go. We ordered a ton of food and it was absolutely delicious. It was one of the best meals I've ever had.

But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I was there, there was a pile of sticky floor next to the table where I was sitting. It was obvious that the staff didn’t clean the table properly. So I asked for the manager and told him about it. He came and apologized but said that they were too busy to clean the tables regularly. I told him that it was not acceptable and that they should hire more staff if they are too busy. He didn’t say anything back, just nodded. I wouldn’t recommend this place if you’re looking for a clean place to have breakfast."
Human,yelp-238,"Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I seated my napkin was a bit crumbled and there where some unused packets of syrup. (packets, really?) It was obvious they hadn't cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets. Basically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side. So it get's 1 star for less than minimum cleanliness required."
LLAMA,yelp-238,"Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I opened the bathroom door, I was disgusted by the filthy condition of the bathroom. The toilet was clogged, there was a puddle of water all around the toilet. The floor was covered in water as well. I just couldn't use the toilet. It was disgusting. I couldn't even go out to tell the waitress, since I couldn't go back in to wash my hands. After having breakfast, my wife went to the washroom. She was screaming at the condition of the washroom. She couldn't use it either. She came out to tell the waitress, who went in to check. She didn't take it too well. We told her that we were going to write a review on Yelp and she said ""go ahead, write whatever you want."" So here it is. Don't go to this place."

The sauce was flavorful and the dish was very filling. The second time I went to Khai Hoan, I ordered the number 15, which is a shrimp and vegetable fried rice. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the vegetables were fresh. The rice was cooked perfectly and the dish was very filling. The service at Khai Hoan was excellent. The staff was friendly and attentive and they made sure that our food was cooked perfectly and that we had everything we needed. The restaurant was clean and comfortable and we had a great time. Overall, I highly recommend Khai Hoan. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. I'm sure you'll have a great time if you visit this restaurant."
PaLM,yelp-243,"A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the beginning because I didn't know many people from her side of the family. But I quickly realized that they were all very nice and welcoming, and I had a great time. We had a potluck dinner, and everyone brought their favorite dishes. There was so much food, and it was all delicious! We also had a lot of fun playing games and talking. I learned a lot about my friend's family that night, and I'm glad that I got to spend time with them. The best part of the night was when we sang Happy Birthday to my friend. She was so happy, and it was clear that she was surrounded by people who loved her. It was a beautiful moment, and I'm so glad that I was there to witness it. After dinner, we all sat around and talked for a while longer. It was so nice to catch up with everyone and hear about what they've been up to. I'm so glad that I got to spend time with my friend and her family. It was a really special night. I'm so glad that I was able to attend my friend's birthday party. It was a great time, and I'm so glad that I got to spend time with her and her family. I'm so lucky to have such a wonderful friend."

I was a little put off at the beginning because it was a surprise for my friend and she was told to bring her husband and not to tell him it was for her. After she found out it was for her she was overjoyed. The food was delicious and the owner of the restaurant was very accomodating. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a get together.
BigScience,yelp-243,"A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the thought that I'd be having dinner with my own mom, but it ended up being one of the best dinners I've had all year. The food came out fantastic - good wine flows well even if you aren't friends-and we spent most of our time catching up over the past 12 months (which has been filled with some major changes). We discussed why she stopped working full-time although she still made enough money to do so; how her family changed so much during this time; what happened to old habits like reading every day or doing yoga outside... And then there were those who are just looking forward to retirement: I have both. I'm currently waiting on The AE Network to call me back about an interview they ultimately decided against airing because ""it didn't fit their brand"" despite having recorded two episodes already. While I don't know when it's going to happen, I'm not worried, as long as I make more than 200kyear from writing, I can live comfortably while waiting and am pretty sure - based upon my income tax return last year - that my accountants will figure out exactly where my life savings should go after taxes to allow us to retire peacefully within five years starting now! While these conversations tend to bring people closer together...there's something to be said for regular breaks in socializing too! So maybe next week there'll be another gathering...

Human,yelp-243,"A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the idea of a pool hall and when I looked up the location, I realized this had some other name when we were in high school and has been around for a long time. The whole Metro Center area has changed a lot over the years. Back in the 80's it was a great place to cruise (when we weren't on Central Avenue), but I digress. I borrowed mom's car, drove from Sun City and arrived close to the start time of the get together. I have been friends with Kari since we were 15 and by coming to town for her birthday weekend, was able to see some women I hadn't seen since we finished high school (back in 1989, yeah I know....) I had very low expectations and I was glad. The place is pretty run down but super low key. Had I been there for other reasons, I would have entered into one of their nightly poker tournaments, but I was there for other reasons. There was a small group of people for this shindig-around 15 at one point but really about 10 for the long haul. No one ended up playing pool, but there were tons of tables, along with darts and some video games. They had a great jukebox and we had a blast playing all sorts of music from several different decades. They offer food (no one ordered any), a full bar and lots of specials on beer. The cocktail waitresses were very nice but that could be because I tip very well, but it was fun. This place could use a really good cleaning as I left smelling like something stalemoldy. Not such a good thing when only in town for the weekend with limited clothing. Thank you Febreeze!"
Tsinghua,yelp-243,"A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the thought of another group dinner, but we went ahead and decided to do it. We ate at a local restaurant called Cook's, which is in a shopping mall in an area called Edison. We didn't do the dinner because the restaurant was too expensive. We got there around 5:30 and decided to get something to eat at a nearby fast food restaurant. After eating, we decided to go out for a walk around the shopping mall. We walked around for about 45 minutes and came back. We sat at the table for another 20 minutes. After waiting, I started getting antsy. We left and went to the car. The restaurant's door was locked. I asked the restaurant manager for the key to open the door and he refused to give it to me. He told me that I could go to the police. I said that I didn't want to go to the police and that I wanted to leave. He told me that I would have to leave anyway. I left and came home. I was mad and disappointed that I had to leave. I have no idea what happened to the key to the restaurant's door. I was so mad that I didn't even take a picture of the door's key chain. This whole thing makes me wonder if the owner is a crook. It's possible that he was out to get us and that he took the key. Maybe he is a thief and a crook. I hope that this doesn't happen to any other people. I just don't want anyone else to have to go through what I just went through. I am glad that the key wasn't lost, but I still wonder what happened to it. I am glad that I was able to get out of the restaurant. I just hope that I can avoid going to Edison again. I'm so glad that I am not living in Edison. What do you think? I have been using the kitchen a lot and making some things to eat. I made a yummy chocolate chip cookie today. It's a cookie recipe that I got from Cooking Light magazine. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's really good. It's kind of like a chocolate chip cookie, but not quite. I also made some smores cookies. I found the recipe on another site and it's also really good. They're not as big as the ones that I used to make. I used a smaller cookie cutter to make them. The one I used for the smores cookies is about the size of a dime. The one I used for the chocolate chip cookies is about the size of a quarter. I also made a chocolate chip cookie cake. I made it in the crockpot and it was really good. I added some butter and sour cream to the batter. I also made some other cookies. They are not the ones that I made today, but they're the ones that I made yesterday. I had some peanut butter cookies, chocolate chip cookies, and strawberry cookies. The strawberry cookies were really good. I also had some oatmeal cookies. I'm glad that I have a lot of cookie recipes that I can use. I am going to try to bake some more cookies. I'm not sure what else to make. I have some more cake recipes that I'm going to try to make. I'm going to try to make some brownies and I'm going to try to make some carrot cake.

PaLM,yelp-244,"It was a pampering experience but unless money is no object I wouldn't go for the food, which was fine but unremarkable. My hot smoked salmon would have passed for supermarket-quality. The leek and potato soup was a bit too thick, and the venison fillet was dry. The service was very good, though, and the staff were attentive and helpful. Overall, I would say that the hotel is worth a visit if you're looking for a luxurious experience, but you're better off eating elsewhere."
BigScience,yelp-244,"It was a pampering experience but unless money is no object I wouldn't go for the food, which was fine but unremarkable. My hot smoked salmon would have passed for fresh if it hadn't been in a few pieces and slightly overcooked. I ordered an ice cream sundae with strawberry curd as my dessert (which contained most of what they had to offer). It wasn't bad at all! Definitely worth trying! We went on a Saturday night, this restaurant does get very busy so make sure you book ahead or wait outside until your table becomes available."

Human,yelp-244,"It was a pampering experience but unless money is no object I wouldn't go for the food, which was fine but unremarkable. My hot smoked salmon would have passed for mediocre wedding food. The beef tartare appetizer was fine. The fudge that came with the coffee was meltingly delicious and they seem to do bottomless coffee so if you have the chutzpah to come and enjoy the ambience and unlimited coffee with fudge for 5.95PS, you have all my support! Otherwise I think that the average diner for whom a restaurant with these price points is an extravagant treat is mainly paying for the maintenance of an extensive wine list you mostly can't afford anyway. I recommend the Northbridge Brasserie (at the Scotsman Hotel) for a luxurious meal that will be delicious in proportion to cost."

The British Heart Foundation's Garden of Remembrance at the British Museum 19 May 2008 The British Heart Foundation's Garden of Remembrance at the British Museum is an impressive oasis of peace and tranquillity in the heart of London. There are sculptures, a walkway, an aviary, an amphitheatre and a memorial for those who have died from heart disease. Opened in 1998, it was inspired by the Greek Garden of Elysium, which was designed by the sculptor Pheidias and the Roman Capitoline Triad. It was designed to pay tribute to the thousands of people who have died from heart disease and those who have survived the disease. It was officially opened by the Queen on 19 May 2008. A sculpture of the goddess of life and regeneration, Demeter, sits in the centre of the garden, flanked by the winged heart of the goddess Hera and the winged heart of the goddess Aphrodite. These two heart-shaped structures symbolise the many hearts that have been affected by heart disease. The garden is the perfect place to be at the end of a long day at work. The National Archives 20 May 2008 The National Archives is the largest archive in the world and holds a vast collection of material relating to Britain's past. It has a vast range of material from the earliest years of the British Empire, including manuscripts, maps, photographs and letters. There are also photographs of 1960s television, a complete set of The Times newspaper from 1825 and an entire section of the British Library containing the complete works of Shakespeare. Founded in 1948 by Sir Henry Vaughan, the Archives were built to store and protect material from the British Empire, from the early days of the British Navy and the Civil War through to the First World War and the Second World War. The Archives is a national treasure and a fascinating place to visit. The Groucho Club 20 May 2008 The Groucho Club is a secret club for actors, writers, directors, comedians and musicians. It was founded in 1924 by Charlie Chaplin and George S. Kaufman, and it is still in operation today. It is located in a small theatre in London's West End, where actors, writers and directors meet up to discuss scripts, actors and songs. The club is still very much a working theatre, with members meeting up for lunch on the first Thursday of every month. I first discovered the Groucho Club while researching a book on the life of John Lennon, and it is an excellent place to take friends who are fans of the club. The National Gallery 20 May 2008 The National Gallery is one of London's most important art galleries and is the second-oldest art gallery in the world, after the Louvre in Paris. It is home to the world's most famous paintings, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Van Gogh and Gauguin. There are also works by medieval and Renaissance artists, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Van Gogh and Gauguin. It was opened by King George IV in 1824 and is open to the public 24 hours a day. The gallery has a permanent collection of around 14,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints and a changing programme of temporary exhibitions. The gallery is one of the best places to visit in London, and a great place to take children. The London Dungeon 21 May 2008 The London Dungeon is an interactive attraction where visitors are taken through a haunted maze of horrors and where they will meet a host of monsters and ghouls, including a flesh-eating vampire, a voodoo priest, a killer clown, a mummy and a zombie. The attraction was opened in 2007 and is located in the basement of the London Eye, the world's largest observation wheel. The attraction includes six rooms, each of which is inspired by a different horror story. There is a castle, a haunted house, a graveyard, a hospital, a Victorian town and a Victorian market."

It changes so there is high replay value and between this and the Fountains you can spend a few days just exploring the place. It's beautiful and worth every step.. The Temple of Poseidon is also here, but a bit of a pain to get to. I got a shuttle boat from the docks (no horses!) and then the trek through the jungle and over the mountains to get to the temple. But, once you are there, it is worth the effort. It's pretty hard to beat. You are now a slave. Poseidon, being the uber-genius that he is, has created you as a slave to the water and to the land. He has hidden you here so that you will serve the people. The main function of the slave is to serve the people, but that doesn't mean you can't use your skills to your advantage. There are some pretty cool upgrades you can buy. There are different types of slaves to choose from, so you can have one that looks like a guard and another that looks like a maid. You can also customize your slaves as you see fit, so there is a lot of variety to it. You are also able to upgrade your slaves. You have to buy upgrades, and they are expensive, but if you use them wisely, you can make some really cool stuff happen. And, you can upgrade them to make them more attractive to the people. The best part is that the people can use the slaves to do things for them. So, the slave can, for example, pick up a piece of furniture and put it on the couch. Or, they can help a family with their housework. It's pretty neat. 5. Poseidon's Avatar Poseidon's Avatar is a 3D MMORPG that is very similar to Runescape. There is no combat, but you can do some quests and interact with the world. There are many ways to customize your character, and there is a wide range of weapons and armor to choose from. The graphics are very good, and the gameplay is very easy to get into. There are a lot of people playing this game, and it is a very friendly place to be. It's a good game, but not one I'd really recommend to people who are new to MMORPGs. 4. The Poseidon Adventure The Poseidon Adventure is a 2D game that plays very much like the original NES game, so if you like NES games, you'll like this one. The graphics are a bit outdated, but they are not too bad. It is a lot of fun to play, and it's a good introduction to Poseidon's world. The Poseidon Adventure is the only game in this list that I played on a computer, and I recommend this game to people who have never played an NES game. 3. Poseidon's Army Poseidon's Army is an action-RPG, but it is not like any other action-RPG you have played before. The game has a lot of different characters to choose from, and each one has a different style of play. There are a lot of weapons and armor to choose from, and you can upgrade each of them. The graphics are very good, and the game is very fun to play. I highly recommend this game to people who like action-RPGs, but want something different. 2. Poseidon's Reign Poseidon's Reign is a 3D action-RPG that is very similar to the Diablo series. There are a lot of different classes to choose from, and you can play the game solo or with other people. There are a lot of cool weapons and armor to choose from, and you can upgrade them. The graphics are very good, and the game is very fun to play. I recommend this game to people who like action-RPGs, but are not too familiar with the Diablo series. 1. Poseidon's Legacy Poseidon's Legacy is a 3D action-RPG that is very similar to the Diablo series. It has a lot of different classes to choose from, and you can play the game solo or with other people. There are a lot of cool weapons and armor to choose from, and you can upgrade them. The graphics are very good, and the game is very fun to play. I recommend this game to people who like action-RPGs, but are not too familiar with the Diablo series. It is also the only game in this list that I played on a computer. Poseidon's Legacy is a good game, but it is very difficult to get into, and you may not enjoy it very much."

It's a beautiful sight, and the sound of the water cascading down the rocks is very calming. There are also some benches where you can sit and enjoy the view. Next to the waterfall is a pond with some koi fish. The fish are very friendly and will come right up to you if you feed them. There are also some turtles in the pond. The area is also home to a variety of birds. You can see ducks, geese, swans, and even some pelicans. The birds are very active and they're always fun to watch. In addition to the natural beauty, there are also some man-made structures in the area. There is a bridge that crosses the pond, and there are also some statues and fountains.

For those into photography, this makes for great practice area. For those who just love taking family photos, this is a great photo op. I will say though that during the day it can get rather crowded so sometimes it'll be a wait before you can get your turn and have a clear shot, but most people are considerate enough to hold walking through if they see you are trying to capture a photo. You get a lot of nice natural sunlight through the glass ceiling, but if you don't mind night shots, it sometimes is very quiet depending on the setup.

The property has an interesting history dating back centuries with numerous mansions here; these are some of the most impressive ones including: This was built in 1858 for Mary Elizabeth Stevenson by her husband James Kidd and his brother Richard Perkin (and later purchased from them). The house stands on a very steep hilltop overlooking the lake at Meadowhill Drive beside Westmount Park. A large first floor room looks out across the lake towards the Castle Island while there's another over looking the park behind it, both rooms have been tastefully restored giving lovely views with good colour schemes inside. Nearby lies one of my favourite little parks called 'Walkers Hill' set amongst quite trees alongside the footpath linking up with Eastbourne Avenue. At the other end of the road stands the imposing 19th century home known as 'Sir Robert Peel House' which now houses the Museum of Family History Colonial Times. This magnificent residence designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens sits majestically along the path that runs parallel to Lake Hurst Road. It features elegant yet sensible architecture blending into its surroundings nestling against a mountain range where the creeks flow into the pool below. The museum contains wonderful pieces of colonial era porcelain and furniture, Indian masks, silver George III style tea sets and much more besides. There's also an extensive collection of artefacts relating to family life such as old school books, toys, photographs etc. Over on the opposite side of the road facing the Gardens lies Sir William Robertson's fine 1810s Georgian Mansion."

A complete lack of professionalism and courtesy from the massage therapist can be extremely frustrating. If you contact Groupon's customer service, they may be able to help you receive a refund or find another therapist that offers a massage in your area. It is important to always read reviews before purchasing any Groupon offers to avoid any inconvenience."

Great service from beginning to end!! Definitely will be coming back again!! High-quality services at a fair price. Highly recommended by friends family that have been here in recent years! Hmmmmm...

BigScience,yelp-247,"Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is n't really the strong point here either. But what sets this place apart from other airports? It's not so much it's location or its size but its quality! The people who work there are genuinely friendly and helpful with any questions you have about flights and things like that...And they're also very knowledgeable! The food in Terminal 3 can be pricey (and not always great), but if you're travelling light and only want to eat for lunch or dinner then it will usually do and save your sanity just as well as anything else There's no need to book too far ahead though unless you know exactly when you'll arrive and decide on where you'd rather stay...

Got there earlier than planned to drop off my friend his family. Then went to visit another colleague. I think all of us were a little surprised. I got some pictures taken in front of Torreon Airlines hangar. Many times we hear stories of how much money these criminals ""make"" online while others see the numbers go down drastically every year due to such losses being confirmed. All right now let me list out some of the ways real estate investors make their living by showing just ONE way that they earn !!!"
Tsinghua,yelp-247,"Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is good. Best thing about it is the food court. Plenty of choices. Not a fan of the food in the terminals, but you can get a decent meal in the food court. I have to say I'm surprised that this is not higher on the list. I live in New Jersey and I've been coming to the ATL for a long time. I used to love the airport and the fact that I was just a few hours from the beach or the mountains. I recently moved to Connecticut and am having a hard time adjusting to a time zone that is 11 hours away from my home. I was told by a friend that I would love the airport here. I was skeptical because I was coming from the Atlanta airport. I flew out of Newark, New Jersey, and arrived at 7:40pm on a Friday. I was surprised to see that the airport was not as busy as I thought it would be. The terminal was fairly clean and there were several large shops in the terminal. The food was fairly expensive, but there was a food court in the terminal that was very clean and had a nice selection of food. The people working the airport were friendly and helpful. The airport is about 40 minutes from the city and it is located in the middle of a suburb that has plenty of hotels and restaurants. The only thing I don't like about the airport is the traffic that it creates. There are so many people trying to get in and out of the airport that it is hard to get a taxi or an airport shuttle. The traffic can be so bad that you could be sitting in traffic for over an hour trying to get out of the airport. This can really ruin your vacation. Overall, the airport is good, but the traffic can be annoying. I've flown into this airport several times and it has always been good. They have a large number of gates, and the check-in counters are well-stocked. It's in a suburban area, but the terminal is big enough that it doesn't seem too far from the city. I don't have any complaints. I haven't been to the ATL in quite some time, but I'm not sure if I would go back to the airport if I had to fly there again. It's not a bad airport, but it's not the best. The food options in the terminals are pretty bad, and it seems that there is always a long line at the check-in counters. The security check is really long, too. There's also a lot of traffic at the airport, so I wouldn't really want to fly there on a weekend. There are a lot of shops in the terminals, and there's also a food court that's pretty decent. Overall, I'm not sure if I would fly into this airport again.

Everything was just great, but the food is not as good as it should be. The burger came out dry and tasted like someone left it too long in the fridge. To me that tells you it has been cooked over something else than charcoal which I don't think they use on their grill. They are hiring an untrained cook who doesn't seem to know what she is doing with her cooking techniques or how high-quality ingredients need to be handled so your taste buds will appreciate them more when it's time to order again"

Tsinghua,yelp-249,"I love Cheesecake Factory and I love to order their avocado eggrolls, yummy. I have no complaints about this restaurant except that I think their cheesecake is just a tad bit dry and tasteless. Other than that, they're perfect. I had a cheesecake sundae with strawberry ice cream, cheesecake and vanilla ice cream. I think I paid 22.75 for my meal and I'm not sure what the price of the sundae was. The menu is on the wall next to the cashier and it's got all their menu items on it. You can also see the pictures of their food on the wall. It was a good meal and I would recommend it to anyone. The menu is simple and straight forward, I really liked that. The price was reasonable too. I also liked that the staff was very helpful and very friendly. My only complaint is that the cashier was really slow and I'm not sure why. It was very hot and humid today so I think that might have had something to do with it.

There are some great restaurants in New York City where you can get delicious food at reasonable prices. One of the best places for breakfast is Blue Note Cafe which has an amazing view from its rooftop terrace overlooking Central Park with stunning sunsets. They also serve an excellent brunch menu on weekends. MoMA PS1 is another museum I'd recommend visiting if you're traveling to NYC. It's located near Chelsea Market so it would be easy enough to walk there or take the subway line 7A (Bakerloo Line) to Museum of Modern Art. The lunch buffet here was really good as well! One of my favorite things to do while I'm staying at Hotel W is go downtown and eat at Pizza Express - they have awesome options and always promptly deliver! Their pizza is delicious too! You've got to try one of these out when you're going to NYC because you won't regret trying them! These yummy bowls are quickly becoming my new favourite thing to snack on when I'm not eating healthy or even enjoying any meal. The cheapest place I've ever been to dinner is almost like walking into your local McDonald's. In fact, maybe that's why we haven't tried most of these locations yet? That said, I've eaten incredibly delicious meals at these few spots and now all I want is to see what else there is to eat around town. When travelling overseas, realising how expensive American fast-food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts can be makes me cringe at times. It used to make us hesitant to visit countries with high costs of living however they're still competitive compared to other areas despite being developed economies themselves.

I have no complaints about this restaurant except that I think their cheesecake is just a tad too sweet for me (but as it'd been my favorite thing there since they opened in San Diego -before going on hiatus- so far), but then again maybe not everyone likes really over the top sweetness? The portions were huge though! The food was great at Sushi Nakazawa because everything came out exactly how we ordered them...

They grow their own herbs, recycle, and donate food to charities. The menu has a very diverse set of appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, and entrees. The items on the menu are very unique, I had never heard of most of them. When I think of Italian I don't think of things like orange-scented duck breast or veal with mushrooms. The menu will make you think of something other than just pasta and chicken. They have a really cool beer menu as well, including the standard beers and a variety of beers that you just can't find anywhere. The bread was delicious and I was really impressed with the pizzas - the dough was made fresh and cooked perfectly. We got a plain cheese and the wild mushroom pizza. The mushrooms were plentiful, and the cheese was the perfect amount. We also got the margarita pizza, which I found to be very average. The pizza sauce was a little bland and didn't really have any flavor. The bread with the garlic and herb oil was delicious. The oil was flavorful and not too greasy. The spaghetti with meatballs was really good. The meatballs were tasty and the sauce was really good. The spaghetti was cooked al dente and had a good bite to it. The Pasta Primavera was delicious as well. The broccoli and asparagus were perfectly cooked and the noodles had a nice al dente bite to them. The sauce was great and I liked that there was a lot of sauce, but not so much that it overwhelmed the dish. I loved that the menu had a variety of pizzas, pastas, and entrees. The food was flavorful and fresh and the service was impeccable. I really appreciate the effort that this restaurant puts into being green and making sure that their menu items are local and fresh."

Chicken was full of dirt, also had a very nasty looking egg in my omelet. Made reservations for 2:30pm on Saturday but only came out 3:00 (2 hours late). Was told if we wanted earlier time they would have our table ready by 1:30pm. We did want early so we left! We've been with this restaurant before when we were here last June...We ordered from their smaller menu which has several different types of pasta dishes that look good! My wife's birthday is next week and she asked me what type of meal (s) could be prepared ahead of time. The waiter pretty much said he didn't know unless you ask one of his co-workers who are better qualified than him - let's call them Eric or Ken or whoever- I warn all others not ordering any soup. After waiting over 20 minutes we finally receive two thin pieces of chicken breast stuffed with cheese. It smelt great, tasted fine- until we opened it because everything looks kind of bland inside except maybe some wilted spinach leaves mixed in. I wish I'd brought something else from home instead of just taking these things off the shelves as quickly as possible after making the reservation... The service was super slow, first come, FIRST serve. There was no water available even though there is an ice machine outside. They gave us red wine glasses although the champagne ones were empty and since I'm sure we'll get wine later and probably pay extra cash for it, why should we use those?"
Human,yelp-252,Very bad food. Honestly couldn't eat it. Had to go get more lunch elsewhere and ended up tossing most of the food I got at Zita. Chicken was full of fat and cartilidge GROSS! Salad tasted like someone dumped vinegar all over it!

Tsinghua,yelp-252,Very bad food. Honestly couldn't eat it. Had to go get more lunch elsewhere and ended up tossing most of the food I got at Zita. Chicken was full of bones. Bread was very hard and stale. What a disappointment. The only reason I'm leaving a 2.5 rating is because I was too hungry to think about how bad the food was.
BigScience,yelp-253,"Good beer but the worst bar food I ever have, especially the wings. They were so over cooked and dry. I was there one day after a long drive last weekend and surprised to see what looked like an empty patio on Saturday night. Well ok wait until 2nd time that happened! Such great atmosphere for such small space. We found some tables out front where we could sit down in shade. The seats are hard plastic with no padding or cushioning which is fine if you enjoy watching people get beat up by their friends as they go at it between opening shots of beers (I'll give them credit they're getting into more mainstream Texas sports than before). But those who don't care will find this basically impossible."

Tsinghua,yelp-253,"Good beer but the worst bar food I ever have, especially the wings. And not good when it comes to pricing. Only good thing was the price for a beer and a shot. The price was 2.00 a shot. The only way you can find better food is to go to a drive thru. I'm not gonna lie, I am a bit of a craft beer snob and this place was good but not great. It was pretty full on a Thursday night. The food was decent. Not too expensive, but I'm not gonna order wings or a taco. Overall I'd say the bar was pretty good. 0 of 0 found this review helpful.

OpenAI,yelp-254,"My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't recommend the specific menu items, as everyone has different taste preferences. However, Pub 1842 at the MGM Grand offers a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and burgers. You can also try their famous ""Drunken cowboy"" and ""Fig and prosciutto"" pizzas. If you're looking for something lighter, their seasonal fruit and granola parfait or the roasted beet salad are good options. Don't forget to pair your meal with a refreshing craft beer or a delicious cocktail."
Tsinghua,yelp-254,"My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't really say we had a great time. The food was okay. We ordered the Blackened Shrimp (13.95) and the Clam and Shrimp Chowder (12.95). The shrimp were just OK, but they were really good with the chowder. My friend's order was also good. We both really liked the bread with the shrimp. I thought the shrimp were a bit overcooked, but that may be my personal preference. The chowder was really good. I didn't realize how creamy the chowder was until I took a bite. It was really nice. It was a bit salty, but that was just the seasoning. The beer was good, but I would have preferred a glass of wine. My only complaint was the prices were a bit high for the food and drinks."
Human,yelp-254,"My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't say that it was necessarily a light lunch, but it was delicious. The ambience is really fun, and we sat in a table toward the back of the restaurant where we had plenty of space to relax and unwind after a morning filled with shopping and walking. Our server suggested the Southside to start, and I was intrigued. They only make 15 large jars per day of this drink, so I decided to take advantage of this special drink. It's just beefeater, fresh lemon juice, and mint. Super delicious. Super refreshing. Of course I ordered a second drink. My friend had the pub's version of a moscow mule, and loved it. We shared the fried pickles, which were perfectly crispy and not greasy at all, and our server recommended the Greek salad and I was requesting lighter fare. The delectable lamb meatballs on the salad weren't exactly light, but I loved them. They definitely made the salad. I'm not sure how it would be for dinner, but everything I tried at lunch was very good."
LLAMA,yelp-254,"My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't lie, my friend has an obsession with buffets (MGM buffet is the best) but I was trying to get her to eat something different and on the fancy side. In the middle of the MGM casino, you'll find this restaurant with a great atmosphere. They have a bar area as well, which is perfect for a drink while you're waiting for your table. We sat outside on the patio, which was nice because it was bright and sunny outside. I had the lunch special which consisted of a mixed green salad with candied walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, and dried cranberries. The salad was huge and I was only able to eat half of it. The dressing was on the sweet side, I like mine to be a bit more tangy. The 1842 Burger is the house specialty. I couldn't resist because it had a fried egg on it, and anything with an egg is always a good thing! The sweet potato fries were great! Crispy and perfect on the side. I had the funnel cake for dessert, which was just okay. Not the best funnel cake I've had."

PaLM,yelp-254,"My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't say I was disappointed. The restaurant was fairly busy when we walked in, but the hostess seated us right away. The atmosphere was nice and cozy, with dark wood paneling and dim lighting. The menu was extensive, with something for everyone. We started with the calamari, which was lightly fried and perfectly cooked. For our entrees, we had the fish and chips and the shepherd's pie. Both were delicious, and the portions were huge. We ended our meal with the sticky toffee pudding, which was the perfect way to finish off a great meal. The service was excellent, and our server was very attentive. Overall, we had a great experience at Pub 1842, and we would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in Las Vegas.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-254,"My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't say that this was the best pub burger or even one of my favorites at The Mirage (which says something about how many burgers they have there!). The food came out pretty fast - you order them off an iPad thingy in your table area while waiting on other people's orders too so everything comes together quickly once someone places their drinkfood request which makes dining experience efficient but not as intimate with servers walking around taking care after each diner like some restaurants are famous now doing...if indeed anyone has been here since May 2008! But hey if getting good service means making more money then why change? Anyways....at least our waiter didn' t seem annoyed by us:P Or maybe he did because i told him 15 gratuity wasn't added onto bill?! Haha...but still paid up anyhows....so what else could possibly make me enjoy eating somewhere enough where back home again next year???? Hmmm........I guess its worth trying just cause no amount ever seems ""enough"" regardless whether way overpriced restaurant such Golden Corral should exist- though always love those TV ads showing happy families enjoying meals during holidays!!! So yeah got great deal going 25 buckstip per couple - few drinks appetizers also included therefore 20 total spent before tip!!! Atmosphere kinda nice near main pool areas ...and lotsa waitresses standing nearby ready whenever signal given from customers.....not ideal seeing hawkish salespeople circling round interested parties who look alone guarding tables seeking new unsuspect clients;p And looks somewhat big inside due 2 roomier floor plan compared w previous location. Drinks were decent, prices weren""l sticking u upside down; however water had bubbles floating within causing strange taste distortion leading needless sugar refills later (!) One hour lounge music playing 5pm weekdays WOWZERS ambiance strong loud bass sounds carrying thru walls slightly disturbing others directly above especially ceiling fans moving much slower than usual"
BigScience,yelp-255,"I came to this place because its close to my home and I know someone that went here and her hair turned out nice so I tried it out. I was given a great package of services including the wash, blow dry and cut. The stylist did an amazing job with all 3 services! She charged me 25 for each if you only wanted just one service but she recommended doing them together. Love your style!!!!! Your prices are very fair too.....sure hope everyone checks out your store in North Daleville!!!!! Hi Carol... I'm from Maryland and looking lately at some good hairstylists..your shop is near by (about 40 min) and I've seen several show up there.So maybe we can meet sometime soon - and go shopping:)"
PaLM,yelp-255,"I came to this place because it's close to my home and I know someone that went here and her hair turned out nice so I tried it out. I booked a hair cut and color appointment for the next day. When I arrived, the stylist greeted me and asked me what I wanted to do with my hair. I told her that I wanted a trim and a color change. She asked me what color I wanted and I told her that I wanted to go from brown to blonde. She said that it would be a big change, but she could do it. She started by washing my hair and then she applied the bleach. The bleach sat on my hair for about 30 minutes and then she rinsed it out. She then applied the toner and let that sit for about 10 minutes. She rinsed that out and then blow dried my hair. I was really happy with the results! My hair was a beautiful blonde color and it looked so much healthier. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone looking for a great hair cut and color. Here are some more details about my experience at the salon:  The salon was clean and well-maintained.  The stylist was friendly and professional.  The price was reasonable.  The results were amazing! Overall, I had a great experience at this salon and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair cut and color. Here are some photos of my hair before and after the color change: [Image of hair before color change] [Image of hair after color change] I hope this helps!"

Human,yelp-255,"I came to this place because its close to my home and I know someone that went here and her hair turned out nice so I tried it out. I initially wanted to get highlights and cut I showed the receptionist a picture and the hairstylist. I basically told her this is what I want. When I finally say down she explained to me the process before she started she offered me a great deal includes hair treatments or conditioning with cut and colorhighlights for 175. To be honest with you I have never paid that much to get my hair done. Anyways, she told me before she starts that I have to sign this paper to pretty much proves that I agree that I'm paying 175. So when she started she cut my hair first which turned out ok. Because I usually just get my trim before doing anything. Then after that she started showing me swatches on what she thought my hair would look nice in. I showed her the picture of how I want the color again and she kept on insisting on chili when The picture looks like blonde brown and light brown. I told her I want what I see in the picture... After a long process of being in the dryer and washer I thought that the color is finally showing up because she showed a little bit if the strip of my hair. Long story short, nothing changed! I got the hair cut! She offered me products and I bought one! But the color stayed the same from when I came in. I love how she went step by step before she did my hair and she said in time it will slowly lighten but honesty I paid 200 to make my hair look like something got done and it was such waste. I called the salon the next day because how upset I was. I wanted to get my hair fixed..And the receptionist said that Sebastian is not in and my hair lady was off as well. And she was going to leave a note to let him know to call me back. So finally the next day came... I called again Another receptionist answered and she said she thinks Sebastian might not be in today or if he is maybe later in today.... Seriously I paid 200 to get something done and the service is horrible. So for now that's my review on this place! I'll update you if Sebastian ever calls me... 41213. P.S I'm doing my review in my cellphone so there's some that's misspelled or typed incorrectly in sorry because I'm trying to get this review ASAP. Thanks! December 13, 2013 Ok, so it took me a while to get back on updating this review, So a week later I finally got a hold of Sebastian from Amnesia Salon, At first he mistaken me with another client with a black hair, and supposedly he told me himself that my hair won't turn out to be the way it is because my hair color is black. First of all... I didn't even talk to this person at all. I saw him go in and out of the salon and that was it anyways, And My hair no black!! Long story short. He told me to come in and they can fix my hair and he apologized with the situation because he realized that I wasn't that client that he supposedly talk too. When I came in, The hair stylist wasn't there yet... So I waited 15 mins. for her to get in. When she got it in.... She has this Nasty attitude, like she didn't want to fix my hair. So I told her what I wanted and the color didn't show up. She still kept on insisting that it will fade over time. But no way im gonna wait a couple of weeks for my hair to fade and I paid 200 to get my hair done! Get the hell out of here! Anyways, She finally started fixing my hair. She still had this nasty attitude towards me while she was fixing my hair but the hair was done and she fixed it. I love how the color turned out, it just like the picture that I showed her initially! I gave her another 20tip... mind you I gave her 20tip the week before and I gave her another tip this visit. I love how it turned out and I gave her my business card for work. I told her that I will call her in a few months to get a touch up. So that was for her to keep! Few days later.... Sebastian started calling my work!! Like WTF!! It wasn't once... it was about 5 times what my co workers told me at least. He said to call me back ASAP! What the hell.... I gave the Hair stylist my business card for her to keep. So we can keep in touch for business.... And sebastian starts calling my work like a maniac! None The less! The experienced with this Salon was supposed to turn around to a good review until Sebastian started to Call my work! How unprofessional! That is worst than a debt collector! NEVER AGAIN! Avoid this place! It is a bad attitude workers and unprofessional people and pricey at the same time!!"

LLAMA,yelp-256,"Was stoked to see this little coffee shop while wandering PHX during a long layover. The menu boards in the back showed Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, and Chemex at MKT, and lots of shops in town. I don't think there are a ton of airports that have that many options. Anyway, I had the Aeropress. My barista brewed me a delicious Costa Rican coffee that I thoroughly enjoyed. Afterward, I chatted with him for a while about his experience in the industry and his time with Press. Press is a newer shop, only open a few years, but the owner has been in the industry for about 20 years and has worked in multiple shops. The barista who brewed me my coffee was very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a pleasure to drink my coffee, chat, and look out the front window onto the terminal. The shop itself is a long, skinny shop, and I'm surprised they fit so many brew options back there. It feels like it's in the middle of nowhere in PHX, but it's actually a good location. It's easy to get to from any concourse, and there is also a post office and bank in the same spot. Brewing Methods: Aeropress, V60, Chemex, Clever, Espresso, Pour Over It's a bit of a walk from any concourse, but it's worth it. If you can't make it out there, there are multiple other good coffee shops at PHX."

The menu boards in the back showed Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, and Chemex at MKT price, which was a definite surprise to se ein an airport. I ordered an Aeropress. I was way too travel logged to really care about looking over their roasts, so went with the barista recommended Providencia. Nice to see them doing an inverted brew on a gram scale, pre-moistening the paper filter, weighing out the water, and timing. I didn't see them pre-warm the Aeropress, nor did they bloom the coffee. Still, the coffee was solid, with a great nose (though maybe any coffee would have done the trick at that point in my travels), and worth the 3.25 market price. I'm a little surprised to see most of those brewing techniques in a high-traffic, speed oriented, environment like an airport. My coffee definitely took a while (as expected), but I can't imagine what this place must be like when slammed (I was the only customer at 7 PM on a Sunday evening). Rad to have this option in an airport environment, and it's a shame I didn't have the timeenergy to explore their roasts. Definitely worth the jaunt to Terminal 4 if you've got a layover in PHX.."

The taste was awesome. Really good coffee! This place is only open for breakfast. It's a bit off the beaten path, but it's worth it! Very cool and interesting place.

We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday and decided to do some shopping in the off season. We went to the north and south valley outlets and there was a ton of great deals. Here's a little peak at what we found. I bought a pair of black wool knee length boots. They are by Agent Provocateur. They are 46 inches tall and the perfect winter boots. I also bought a cute suede coat. I didn't buy the boots, but I do love the coat. It's only 30 bucks, but I'm really digging it. I think I might be a little bit pregnant because I am wearing it on my back side. I'm glad we went to the outlets, but I'm sad I didn't get more for my money. The good news is I'm back in California and can buy my things here. I'm hoping to hit the stores on Thursday, so I'll have a little more money in my bank account. We'll see.

I think I'm finally ready to have my nails done. My mom has been nagging me to go for a long time. It's a great feeling to have my nails done. I love my nails. I just love having them. I think I'm finally ready to do it. I've been wearing them long, so I'm not sure how it's going to be. I'm just going to try it out. I'm going to go to a local salon called At Home Salon. I'm not sure what they do, but it's been in my area for a long time. I don't think I'm going to go as fancy as going to an expensive salon. I just want to go and have my nails done. It's going to be fun and relaxing. I'm hoping I'll like it. I'll keep you posted on my nails. I hope I don't regret it. I'm going to go now and pick out some colors for my nails. I'm thinking of going with something berry or burgundy. Maybe a combination of the two. I'm going to have to think about it a little bit. It's so hard to pick a color for my nails. Lately, I've been thinking about getting a tattoo. I think it's time to do it. I've been thinking about it for a long time. I've even had it on my list of things to do. I think I'm finally ready to do it. I'm not sure where I'm going to get it done. I think I'll have to go back to California for it. I have been thinking about getting it done on my belly. It's a perfect spot. I don't have to worry about my clothes covering it. I just need to figure out a design. I've been looking at a lot of designs. I've even gone as far as to have a design made.

LLAMA,yelp-257,"I'm in shopping heaven!! Usually I'm a little skeptical about going to the outlets. It's just overwhelming and I usually am dissatisfied. We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday and we took a trip out to Primm, NV. We went to the Fashion Outlet of Las Vegas. It was amazing. It was so well organized and easy to maneuver. The stores were well stocked and the deals were incredible. I didn't buy as much as I would have liked but I did find a few things. I'm telling you this place was really really good."
OpenAI,yelp-257,"I'm in shopping heaven!! Usually I'm a little skeptical about going to the outlets. It's just overwhelming and I usually am dissatisfied. We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday That's great to hear! The outlets can be overwhelming at times, but they can also offer great deals and discounts. If you need any assistance while you're shopping, don't hesitate to ask the store associates or a shopping concierge if available. It can also be helpful to have a plan or a list of the items you're looking for, so you don't get distracted by all the options available. Happy shopping!"
BigScience,yelp-257,"I'm in shopping heaven!! Usually I'm a little skeptical about going to the outlets. It's just overwhelming and I usually am dissatisfied. We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday so we had an extra day before heading back home to Dallas (beating out Denver, Colo.). The weather was perfect this year but it is bitterly cold! This place has everything you can imagine even Cyber Monday deals! We went from 8:30am until 1:00pm making sure we found all our bargains!!! And we did...including my own personal favorite trunk at Forever 21... But here's some of what made the most sense on the trip - public transportation. If you're planning your vacation or are taking part in one like myself, there aren't many better ways than using mass transit. Our first stop was Union Station which lies directly across the street from MGM Grand Hotel Casino. They have bus service that runs every 15 minutes between 5:00 AM - 10:00 PM, with shuttles running outside those hours. Once again, if it's too earlylate for your departure time make sure to call ahead since last-minute changes happen quite often. If that's not convenient then there's plenty more options including taxis; Metro Express buses as well as Coach tours. It's definitely worth checking different services upon arrival because sometimes they change their schedules andor route during peak times. The MGM Grand offer two complimentary shuttle services daily connecting guests to Downtown Las Vegas: MGM Shuttle Bus only takes passengers free-of-charge within a four-mile radius around the hotel's main entrance. Based on our experience the easiest way of getting here would be by car through the nearby freeway system. You may want to plan accordingly based on traffic patterns - especially after midnight when 75 of motorists don't drive themselves!"

Hubs just shoved me out of the car so I could shop and he drove off to find parking. So many stores! Where to begin?? Just start walking. This place was so crowded, but it got me excited because there were so many great stores here. Much better than the ones back home in Cali. Kate Spade, Coach, Michael Kors, Columbia, so many more!! All my money went here instead of the casinos. Make sure to stop by before you leave."

Hi, it costs money to have a credit card, and a server can't accept a fake credit card to use as a gift card. If you want to complain about this, go to the bank that issues your card. I have always received good service here and have never had a problem with their food. I can say the same for their drinks. They are very busy and only have so many bartenders. They are not a big corporation, so they are not going to have a bunch of bartenders just standing around. I also have no problem with the prices of their drinks. It is a bar, not a grocery store. I have never had a problem with the drinks or the service here. I am not sure if this is a current review, but I have a problem with some of the statements. To say that the burger is microwaved is not true. I don't know if you have ever seen a kitchen that uses a microwave to cook burgers, but it is not a pretty sight.

I have been here quite a few times, and I have never had a problem with the food or the service. This place is always busy, so there is a chance that you may have to wait a little while for a table.

However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead. In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here. That says a lot.

Hi, it costs money to have a credit card and then we go out with the cash flow all around us; this is why they charge you an extra fee on top of your actual price!

Just wait until you're ready to move into another area or country before deciding whether to get insurance through Homeowners Insurance Worldwide DBA Affinity. And if I'm right about those numbers - I hope that happens by the end of next year - when I see them I'll be happy. It's not like my home hasn't been hit hard enough: water damage and torn shingles cost hundreds of dollars each time; even though it's wintertime now the cold weather keeps blowing ice downstairs every week which means more costly repair bills. This may sound strange but I really did enjoy ordering online online as well. This company makes sure customers never pay any unnecessary charges while shopping online. You can also take advantage of free shipping deals available regularly on the website. There's no need to worry about delivery fees because everything will arrive safely straight to your door step without you having to pay anything upfront or putting any effort whatsoever. For instance, any time you buy something using a discount code, you'll only incur a small additional fee instead of paying full retail prices during checkout. You won't find a better deal than these anywhere else including other sites offering similar services. So what exactly do you expect to receive? What kind of quality products does Home Depot offer?

Hi, it costs money to have a credit card I completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately, some customers tend to have unrealistic expectations and may leave negative reviews for reasons beyond the control of the business. It's important to remember that some customers may also leave positive reviews, which can help balance out the negative ones. Regarding credit card fees, it's a common practice for businesses to charge fees for credit card transactions to cover the costs of processing. However, depending on the type of business and their overall expenses, some may choose to absorb those fees as a cost of doing business. It's ultimately up to the business owner to determine what is best for their business."

Tsinghua,yelp-259,"So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what. I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck between a few places. So, I ended up getting the ""pizzas"" deal for the pizzas in South Park. Turns out, they were fantastic. So, we had a few slices of pepperoni, some chicken, and a chicken burrito. We went to the Taco Bell drive thru, and the lady said she wanted to pay cash, so she handed me a twenty and I started to put it in my wallet, but I ended up giving it back to her and asked her to use the ATM instead. It was worth the ten bucks. Sunday, July 20, 2011 Ok, so this week was a tough week. A tough week with very little time for fun. The first week of July is always a busy one, but I think it's because it's the start of the summer. But this year was a little different, because we had a lot of weddings to attend. I'm not sure if it was the weather, or the time of year, but it was a lot of weddings this year. My first wedding of the summer was my brother's wedding. It was a small wedding, only about 150 people, but it was still a fun day. The wedding was at a country club, and it was a beautiful wedding. My parents took the day off of work, so it was really nice that they were able to spend the day with us. The food was amazing, and the bride was beautiful. We had a few weddings the next weekend, so it was nice to be able to take a break from all the weddings. My second wedding was the weekend before last, and it was for my uncle. My uncle is an artist, and he's always been really cool. I've known him since I was a little kid, and he's always been a really cool guy. So, I was really excited to attend his wedding. It was a beautiful wedding, and it was really nice that he invited my parents. It was a really fun wedding, and it was nice to spend the day with family. It's hard to get back into the swing of things after a weekend of weddings. The last weekend of the summer was pretty busy, too. My sister and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday. It was a great trip, and we had a great time. We didn't have much time to do anything, but we had a really good time. It was nice to spend the weekend with my sister. I also attended a wedding for my friend, and I was able to spend some time with her and her fiance. It was a fun wedding, and it was nice to spend some time with them. So, that was this week. I had a busy week, but it was a good busy week. It was nice to get back into the swing of things. Saturday, July 12, 2011 Well, I've been really busy this week. I went to Las Vegas with my sister to celebrate her birthday. We went to see the Cirque du Soleil show, and it was a great show. I was able to get in a lot of great deals on things in Vegas. I was able to get some good deals on hotels, meals, and tickets. I'm really excited about getting some good deals, because I'm going to Vegas again in August. So, it was a great trip. We had a lot of fun, and I'm really looking forward to going again. I've been busy all week. It's been a really busy week. I have a lot of work, and it's really getting me down. I'm having a really hard time with it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. It's just getting me down, and I'm having a really hard time dealing with it. It's been a really tough week. I'm really trying to be patient with it, but it's really getting me down. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm not really sure what I can do to fix it. I'm trying to just stay positive, but it's just really hard. I'm having a really hard time with it. I'm really struggling. I'm really struggling with it. It's been a really tough week. It's been a really tough week, but it's almost over. I'm going to Vegas next weekend. I'm really excited to go. I'm really looking forward to going. I'm really excited about going to Vegas. I'm really looking forward to getting some good deals."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-259,"So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what. I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck between Gyros or Chinese Asian Takeout Food for 20 per person with a coupon code NINJA30 (which is 30 off), so we decided that's where our dinner money would go! We arrived at 11:00 pm expecting plenty more people there than it actually ended up being; although everyone seemed quite happy as they waited patiently their turn - even those who just wanted take out orders!! I guess my first mistake wasn't realizing how popular these burgers are all over ALL cities throughout Chicago because not only did this place have long lines but also must order them ahead by callingtexting an hour before your arrival time OR if you want delivery call TONIGHT!!!

LLAMA,yelp-259,"So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what. I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck on the thought of getting a burger. Well, lo and behold, there was a 50 off coupon for Burger 21 in Dunwoody. If you haven't seen them around, Burger 21 is a chain of burger restaurants that originated in Florida that is now in multiple states and has plans for more. They offer over 20 different burger options on the menu. The restaurant itself is in a strip mall in Dunwoody, which is an upscale suburb of Atlanta. It's a nice area, but you would never know that by looking at the strip mall, which is a bit drab. The restaurant itself is pretty nice with a clean interior and an open kitchen. I arrived around 8:00 pm, so it was getting pretty late for dinner and it wasn't too crowded. We were seated quickly, but the first problem was that the hostess was not really sure where to seat us. She asked us if we were cool with sitting at the bar, which was fine, but it was a bit confusing as to why she asked. The bar was nearly empty with one lone customer, so it wasn't like she was trying to find seats for us. The hostess left, and we were then greeted by our waiter. He was nice, but seemed very new to the job. He quickly took our drink orders and came back with them in a decent amount of time. The menu was very simple and easy to read. As I mentioned, they have 21 burgers that you can order, but also offer a few other sandwiches. There are also salads if you are not in the mood for burgers. For appetizers, you can get your normal fries and onion rings, but also have some unique options like sweet potato tots, yuca fries and tempura green beans. We decided to order the tempura green beans as our appetizer. The lady had gotten them before and liked them a lot. I had never had them before, but they looked good. We ordered them and they came out with the dipping sauce. We had not asked for the sauce, so it was nice to see that it came with the order. The sauce was a spicy aioli that was very tasty. The green beans themselves were very good. They had a nice, light tempura batter on them, and were very crispy. They also were cooked perfectly. They were slightly undercooked, but this was just right for me. They were crunchy and delicious. For my entree, I decided to go with the Tex-Mex Haystack Burger. I am a sucker for a good jalapeno burger, and this had sounded pretty good. The burger had guacamole, salsa, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos. I also added bacon, because bacon is delicious. The burger itself was pretty good. I had ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The patty was nicely seasoned and juicy. The toppings were good as well. I didn't really get a whole lot of the salsa, but the chipotle mayo was really good. I liked the guacamole and pepper jack cheese, but I felt like the lettuce and tomato were a bit unnecessary. I liked the jalapenos and bacon. They were a nice addition. The only real problem was that the bun was just too large. It was too much bread. The patty was good size, but not big enough to make the burger proportionate. The lady got the shrimp po'boy. It had fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and remoulade sauce on a baguette. The lady didn't really like it. The shrimp was good, but the bread was a bit chewy. The sauce was very tasty though. The service was a bit slow. It took a while to get our order in. There were only a few other customers there, but there were a few other tables that were being served as well. The waiter seemed to be running around a lot, but didn't really seem like he knew what he was doing. He was nice, but was just all over the place. The cost was 26.00. This was with a drink and the 10 coupon. I would have been"

I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck between a bunch of places that looked pretty good. I had decided on going to a Mexican restaurant when I saw an ad for a local burger joint that was having a 50% off deal. I love burgers, so I decided to check it out. We walked into the restaurant and it was pretty empty. There was only one other couple there, which was a little weird considering it was a Saturday night. We sat down at a table and looked over the menu. There were only a few burgers on the menu, but they all looked pretty good. I decided to get the Big Kahuna burger, which was the most expensive one on the menu. The burgers came out pretty quickly and they looked amazing. The Big Kahuna burger was huge and it had all the fixings. I took a bite and it was delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked and the cheese was melted perfectly. The fries were also really good. We finished our burgers and decided to get some dessert. They had a really good looking chocolate cake, so we decided to split that. The cake was really moist and it was topped with a delicious chocolate ganache. We finished our meal and left the restaurant feeling really satisfied. Overall, I had a really good experience at this restaurant. The burgers were amazing and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good burger."

I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck in between two choices: Rita's and another unnamed Phoenix establishment that we had already been to that is always solid never great. Well, what the hell, let's give Rita's a shot. Nice and conveniently located on 35th and the I-10, we find a spot and get in. Order a few margaritas and they were great. I'm not the world's biggest fan of the marg but Aaron knows how to hook it up. Next, we ordered the table side Guac, I got the Playa Bonita, the lady got the Seafood enchiladas. Everything was OUTSTANDING. I tried her enchiladas and they were dynamite and I had about 4 different kinds of fish that were all cooked perfectly. Service was outstanding, food was fantastic, there was absolutely no reason this place wasn't jam packed on a Saturday night. I suggest you go support a local business that does things right. I love Pappadeaux as much as the next guy and can say that Rita's stands just as tall next to them in service and food quality. You won't get the white tablecloth but you will have an extra 50 in your pocket when you leave and be just as satisfied."

We needed something light but not too simple or cheap. I did a little research online for the restaurant we wanted to go to, found it pretty good on reviews (not my favorite, but okay), then decided that I wouldn't have time to wait outside so just walked up there. (I'm trying really hard this week to be patient because I'm super busy as always with work.) The place wasn't huge, like most places here are these days... There were three tables that could seat 6 people max. They also stocked beer wine though no spirits at all. The guys told me they served meals regularly every day except Sunday which they said surprised them considering the price point but is understandable due to their location overlooking bars clubs."

Tsinghua,yelp-261,"There is nice seating outside on the sidewalk, like many restaurants along Mont Royal. We had breakfast outdoors here one morning during our most recent stay in the Plateau area. It was pleasant enough. They do not take reservations. We were able to get a table for 2 as long as we arrived early. We would suggest arriving 15 minutes before you are ready to be seated to ensure that you are seated. We did not notice any wait at all. The food was good. We had a panini with a fresh tomato and a baguette. The service was good, and the wait staff was very friendly. We were pleased with our meal and our experience."

Great value and a nice little place for breakfast."

We had breakfast outdoors here one morning during our most recent stay in the Plateau area of Montreal. The place was hopping, both inside and out, and we had to wait a short time for a table. The interior of the restaurant is also very nice, with a retro style and a cool wall mural of a DJ. The food was really good. I had the eggs benedict, which were perfectly done, and my friend had the daily special, which was a pesto omelette with salmon. She also had some really good toast with brie and fruit preserves. The service was efficient and friendly, and we enjoyed our meal."

I've tried the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel food, but they were fussy eaters. So, I bought the more expensive food, and they gobbled it up, and they've never had a single health issue since. The fact that the food is actually good for them makes me feel better about feeding them this stuff. They're also so easy to shop for. It's such a relief to know that they have everything that I need. The place is always clean, and the staff is always helpful. I don't have to worry about running out of food or anything. I also love that they have treats for them. My cat is a bit picky about his treats, and he gets plenty of variety at this place. I love that I can find the best food for my cats, and I can find them here. This place is a great resource for my pets and me. I love it! I have a rescue cat, and he is a special needs cat. He has lived in a shelter for a long time, and so he is picky about his food. I live in the city, and it is hard to find good, human grade food for him. I tried the cheaper food, but he wouldn't eat it. I tried the Innova food, but he wouldn't eat that. I went to this store, and I tried the A.P.C. (American Pet Products Corporation) food, and he gobbled it up. It's the best food I've found for him. I love that it's made for cats, and it's made by a company that cares about pets. The food is great, and it's made in the USA. It's not made by some giant company. I am so happy that I found this place. I have a cat, and she's been a bit fussy about her food. I've tried a lot of different brands, but she's never liked any of them. I tried the free range food, but she wouldn't eat it. I tried the Natural Balance food, but she wouldn't eat that. I tried the Innova food, and she wouldn't eat that. I was so disappointed. I was ready to give up on her. But, I came to this store, and I bought some food from the A.P.C. food. She gobbled it up. It's so good. It's made for cats, and it's made in the USA. She's happy, and I'm happy. I can't believe that I found this place. It's so hard to find the right food for cats. I love it! I have 2 cats, and they are both elderly. They both had chronic health issues, and I was so worried about them. They were in a lot of pain, and I was scared. I was worried about them dying, and I was ready to put them down. I went to this store, and I bought the raw food, and they loved it. They started eating it, and their pain started to go away. They were so happy, and I was so happy. They're both doing better, and I'm so happy that I found this place. I have 2 cats, and I love it. I love that they have the food for the cats.

Places like Chewy and Petco often carry a wide variety of premium cat foods, including Innova Evo and Nature's Variety products. You can also check the websites of these brands to see if they offer a store locator tool. Additionally, some local pet stores and raw food co-ops may carry the frozen raw medallions.

They live in a cooped up house so it's hard for us to stock their diet daily but we try our very best!

The owner is awesome, friendly and makes you feel at home. He is a professional and provides a great service. If you are looking for a place for a haircut, you can't go wrong here. Thanks again Jose!! The owner is very professional and very knowledgeable about his craft. I came in for a haircut and got a great cut. Great place to get a good haircut, great customer service. They really take their time with you and give you a very clean look! The best place to get your hair cut in Denver! I have gone to many barbershops in Denver and this is by far the best place to go. I always get compliments on my hair cut and style. I get cut and styled by Michael and he always gives me the best cut and blow dry I've ever had. I recommend this place to all my friends and family. Jose is very experienced in the art of cutting hair. He pays attention to detail and he listens to his customer's needs. He also knows how to cut the hair of all ethnicities. I always get complements on how good my hair looks. Jose is a master of his trade. I've been going to him for about a year now and he always does a great job. His attention to detail is top-notch. He takes his time and won't rush you out. He's a master of both straight and curly hair. He has a great personality, is very knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor. Highly recommended. The staff here is very professional. They pay attention to detail and take the time to get your hair just right. I get compliments on my hair all the time and always recommend them to others."

I've been going to this location for years now and I can honestly say it's the best hair salon I've ever been to. They are the most accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable staff that I've ever had the pleasure of working with. My hair is curly and they have helped me out with so many styles, including highlights, short hair, short and curly, long hair, and braids. I would recommend this location to anyone.

Their cream Italian ices are amazing. We usually get the mint chocolate chip, but I've tried several others and they are all delicious. We also got the fudge brownie one time and it was really good too. I also love the fact that they have a ton of flavor options and you can choose how many flavors you want. I would definitely recommend it! I really enjoyed this ice cream shop. The selection of ice cream flavors is fantastic. The service was great, and the employees were very friendly. The prices are a little high, but that is to be expected for such high-quality ice cream. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. I love this place. They have amazing cream italian ice and a lot of flavors. It's a great place to go on a hot day. The service is always good. Best ice cream in Pittsburgh! By far the best ice cream in Pittsburgh. Staff is extremely friendly and so helpful.

They also offer a ton of other ice cream options. I am not a huge fan of their milkshakes or sundaes. I have found their milkshakes are very thick and the sundaes are not my favorite. But their ice cream is perfect and I can't go anywhere else. I love this place. I love this place! They have so many options for ice cream.

I understand that there are some people who do not like seeing and or touching dogs, but if you can give them an area where no dogs are allowed please refrain from having them outside of Petsmart stores. The only time I've ever seen a dog go out for a walk alone has been on Bayshore Drive.

LLAMA,yelp-266,"Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (SunnyslopeDunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this bish! I am so used to finding the best deals in the Ross Dunlap store that I was not expecting to find anything. Although I did find something and I also found something else. What I found was a bottle of the ""Hit"" nail polish in ""Ice Ice Baby"" in the store brand section. I found it in the clearance section for only 1.00. I only buy the ""Hit"" brand of nail polish because it's the only one that doesn't break off my nails and make them look like they're rotting. So I was super excited to find this color for a good price. I also found a bottle of ""Color Club"" brand nail polish in a dark purple with a pink shimmer color called ""Crown Me Already"" I was really surprised to find this brand and color in a Ross. The best part was the price.... it was only 2.00! And as I was checking out at the counter my eyes landed on a little accessory that I have been wanting since the summer! It was a gold and silver metal cuff that you can snap to fit your wrist. It looks just like the ones from ""Forever 21"" but this one was only 3.00! I am so excited about this find! I will definitely be shopping at this Ross more often. That is a really nice cuff! I also love the color of the Hit nail polish. That is a good price for it."

The Sunnylsop Dunalsp is a half size bigger than the one at Stehie Rd, so that's saying something because they're only about 20 miles apart and both are considered large stores for their categories... The carpetcarpet padding looked like cat puke on hardwood floors with holes all over them.. There were no displays of products or anything but instead there just random pieces scattered around inside outlining what you can buy.... They had 3 different types if wood flooring: Pergo from 799-849 square feet!, bamboo looking planks (199-249 sq ft), then 2 kinds laminate tiles which did not have prices listed anywhere! One kind has greenish bluish sheets stacked together while another looks more solid grayed brown colored once laid down by themselves...... Each type came 10""x14' sheet sizes costing approximately 1k each!!!!!! And when u ask where do i get these installed? Well without giving any info she says ""they come preinstalled,"" WOW!!!! Asked her how much does he install per piece? She said its free since we provide installation service??? Whoa who wants someone else installing your expensive home improvement project?????? Yeah right..... What an idiot thought process well thats ok im here now let me look through some other stuff before heading back north towards Ranchos de Palmas again lol.... Bought nothing today except thinking wow people should be fired after seeing such poor excuse being sold under name EBAY!!!!!!!!"
Human,yelp-266,"Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (SunnyslopeDunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines! The couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them. The odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals."

I was shocked to find that the prices were the same as my favorite Ross. The selection was terrible. I could not find a single item that I liked. I even tried to find a pair of socks but they didn't have any in my size.  The staff was rude and unhelpful. I asked a woman at the register if they had any more socks in my size and she rolled her eyes and said ""no."" I asked her if she could check in the back and she said ""no"" again.  I left the store feeling disappointed and frustrated. I will not be returning to this Ross again.  I would recommend that you go to the Sunnyslope/Dunlap store instead. The prices are the same and the selection is much better. The staff is also much more friendly and helpful."

I have eaten at Fuddruckers 3 times and it was not worth the money. I do not recommend this place.

PaLM,yelp-267,Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay 30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their own buns. Fuddruckers uses the same frozen buns as every fast food restaurant and it is the worst part of the burger. The rest of the burger is just ok but the buns are terrible. I would rather eat a burger with a homemade bun that isn't even cooked right than eat a Fuddruckers burger.
OpenAI,yelp-267,"Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay 30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create more flavorful burgers, as that is the main attraction for customers. If you are looking for a more flavorful burger experience, you might want to try some of the local burger joints in your area, or even try making your own burgers at home using fresh ingredients and seasonings. Additionally, many fast food chains offer value deals and coupons to help you save money while still enjoying a satisfying meal."
Human,yelp-267,"Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay 30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a 9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well."

I do love the strawberry ice cream ones, but they aren't quite as good after having tried those in France (see above). The vanilla shake also has some sort of soy milk hollowed out inside it...so strange!

They have the most amazing, freshly ground, hand rolled, handmade, raw (yes, raw) tortillas. They are out of this world! I go there and get 40 4 oz. tortillas for about 4.50 and then go and buy a pound of their flour for 11.00 and make 48 tortillas. Yep, 48! That's 2.00 a tortilla and you can have them all to yourself! Yummy. I use the tortillas for many things, like for baking tortilla pizzas, enchiladas, burritos, breakfast burritos, omelets, wraps, and just about anything. I buy the flour and use it for all my baking. So yummy! They are the best tortillas I have ever had. Go there and get a couple of samples, then get your 40 tortillas and your flour and go home and make some delicious food. If you like the flavor of the tortillas, then buy a gallon of their flour, and you can make 200 tortillas! That's a lot of tortillas! I love them! I know they are expensive, but I know they are worth every penny! No wonder they sell out every time I go there! I wish they would have a store here in Texas! Maybe if they have a store in Texas, I will buy more flour! I also buy a large bottle of their raw garlic oil for 5.00 and use it for many things, like for seasoning my flour tortillas, enchiladas, and just about anything. So yummy! I will be going back there and getting more samples and more flour and more garlic oil!

The guy who waited on me was very nice, knowledgeable and wanted to help me out even though I was not his biggest customer. I wanted half a tenderloin and he said if I could come back the next day he would save me the center from the cuttings. It was over 3 lbs of the best part for about 40!

I love going here for a special occasion or just to pick up some snacks. I recently went here to pick up some cheese for a party I was hosting. I was really impressed with the selection and the staff was very helpful in making suggestions. I ended up getting a variety of cheeses, including a brie, a manchego, a goat cheese, and a blue cheese. They also had a great selection of meats, including prosciutto, salami, and ham. I also picked up some crackers and bread to go with the cheese and meat. Everything was delicious and I got a lot of compliments on the cheese board I put together for the party. I will definitely be going back to this place again. Here is a more detailed review of the store: The store is located in a small strip mall in Scottsdale. It is not very big, but it is packed with a wide variety of cheeses, meats, and charcuterie. The prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The cheese selection is impressive. They have a wide variety of cheeses from all over the world, including brie, cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan, and goat cheese. They also have a good selection of specialty cheeses, such as blue cheese, goat cheese with cranberries, and goat cheese with honey. The meat selection is also good.

My wife call me after eating that she could of eaten 5 or 6 panini's before we left there. We have gotten King Gyro for years, one time at our local airport when we got some upgrades. We were given tickets in first class because we came late as well. This is not new, but its always good to hear again how big this chain has become. Great job guys! First time buying king gyros since moving here from Florida. It seems like every restaurant menu comes out having something different than last year (which used to be perfect). Screw you chains!! It may take longer now but not much less money. Last week right off my flight to Vegas i bought a King Gyro Pitta roll 1 chicken kabob 1 pita wrap an apple juice 12.99 lugits. Not going anywhere soon b4 i get tired of these prices Nowadays it's difficult enough finding someone who doesn't understand French. But if that person happens to also speak Spanish - watch out! You're golden! French people love their wine too: 44 claim that many wines come closer to representing the country's vineyards then other European countries do;"

The lamb gyro was the best thing I’ve ever had. The pita bread was fresh and warm, and the meat was perfectly cooked. The tzatziki sauce was the perfect compliment to the gyro. I also had the fries, and they were the best fries I’ve ever had. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I would recommend King Gyros to anyone who is looking for great food."

I had a sandwich with the greek yogurt and it was so good I had to take a picture. I was not expecting that at all. The greek yogurt is the best I have ever had. 25012015 very good Posted by adam s. on 25012015 This was the first time I had the chicken gyro, which was fantastic. However, I found the greek yogurt (and dip) to be very weak. I didn't like the way the chicken tasted, but the greek yogurt was the best I've had in the states. 25012015 The most AMAZING gyros EVER! Posted by Catherine G. on 24012015 I've been to this place several times, and each time I return I find myself ordering the same gyro - the chicken! OMG. They have the most delicious marinated chicken. I have had the beef, and I like that as well. I also love the greek yogurt with it. If you're a fan of gyros, I highly recommend trying this place out. 24012015 Good but not great Posted by Molly on 24012015 We had the beef and chicken gyros and the chicken was delicious but the beef was a little bland. 24012015 Posted by Terry G. on 24012015 I have been to this place many times and the food is always great.

It's possible that they may have plans to implement a recycling program in the near future, or they may be able to provide alternative solutions such as partnering with nearby recycling centers or scheduling regular pickups with a recycling service. If you haven't done so already, I would recommend reaching out to them to express your concerns and see if there are any options available."

We asked for a table on a Wednesday evening and were told no way possible without reservations, despite the fact that the restaurant was less than half full. We were then told that we could wait for a table to become available, but that it could take up to 2 hours. We decided to leave and find another restaurant. The next day, we returned to the restaurant and tried again. This time, we were seated immediately and had a great experience. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We were very impressed with the change in attitude and service from the previous night. We were also impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was cozy and inviting, and the staff was friendly and attentive. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience."

She then suggested a high top table at the bar so we took one of those. We waited at it for about 15 minutes before being helped. Once the waitress came over we were ready to order dinner. We then waited about 45 minutes.... no bread.... no waitress.... no nothing! We took the bread off another table that left due to lack of service because we were starving! Steaks finally came out after an hour.... no silverware and overcooked. Big surprise.... my baked potato came out about 10 minutes after I finished my fillet. Not a standard desert, but I was hungry so o gave it a whirl.... pretty much raw. I wouldn't of been happy paying 20 for this shit let alone the 70 ot cost. DO NOT COME HERE! EVER!"

What is their problem? A nice lady asks if she's free to join them because she has kids coming in but not able to reserve as well.

So finally when another woman comes up and says ""we've got plenty of room..."" my husband son come out and thankfully were seated before someone else arrived. After dinner the waitress brought up our bill which included two appetizers (a fillet steaks dish where he ate all his meat off by himself), several dishes including filet mignon main course, chicken parmesan pie - everyone said good job but me, I'm pretty picky about food so what did I like??

She said yes and immediately began preparing my order. However, when I noticed that the other group of people were still waiting for their food, I went and sat down and waited for my food. Another 15 minutes went by and the other group still hadn't received their food. The lady came back over to me and said ""you want to wait some more?."" I said no, I would take my food.

The only thing really interesting was the taco bar which was ok but rather limited. The meat was super salty and the extras where far and few. Then finally I went to try out the pizza. It was wood fire but then I ate it there was way too much cheese on the pizza and the sauce was sweat. Seriously who puts sweat tomato sauce on pizza? That pretty much did it for me with this buffet.

I seen the sign that said WI Dairy Queen so we decided on a whim it would be worth going in for take out and enjoying our lunch outside when my dad got done riding his bike (he rides about 15 miles every day). I ended up getting all three flavors which cost me 3 each because there were two people ordering them...but only one person eating! haha But not really complaining as they are good ice cream treats here!!"
Human,yelp-276,"I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good Mex restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review. First, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the California Surfing burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce. The only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there including these two menu items on other occasions has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon. It's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though. I have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times. At least, it will for now."
LLAMA,yelp-276,"I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good Mex restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times, and I've had consistently good meals there. The service is friendly and courteous. The food is fresh, well-prepared, and tasty. The portions are quite large. This is a modestly priced place with a ""south of the border"" atmosphere. You'll find plenty of locals dining there, which is always a good sign. Los Cabos is one of the few places I've been to where the food tastes like the same dish I had at a restaurant in Mexico. There is a good selection of Mexican specialties, and they have a full bar as well. All in all, Los Cabos is a great place to have in the neighborhood. It has a friendly atmosphere, good food, and is reasonably priced. I definitely recommend Los Cabos. LOS CABOS is a new, fresh, exciting restaurant that specializes in Mexican cuisine. The menu has something for everyone. The food is authentic, fresh, and well prepared. Great mexican food, good atmosphere, excellent drinks. The service is very good and the staff is friendly and courteous. I am a chef at a restaurant in San Francisco. This is the first time I've ever written a review, but I really felt the need to share my experience at Los Cabos. I live in the neighborhood, and I was very excited to hear a Mexican restaurant was moving in. I work long hours and frequently dine alone. I went to Los Cabos twice and both times they treated me with genuine respect and friendliness. I felt very comfortable there. The food was fresh and delicious. The service was excellent, and the prices very reasonable. I can't wait to try their brunch. I am a college student who lives in the area. I work nearby and so I often go to lunch with my co-workers at Los Cabos. We are a group of 4 or 5 people and we always enjoy the food there. The food is tasty, reasonably priced, and the service is always very good. I'm a big fan of Los Cabos. I used to go there when it was first opened. The food is excellent. LOS CABOS is a great restaurant. The food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is great. We have a large group of friends who frequently meet there for dinner, and we always have a good time."

BigScience,yelp-276,"I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good Mex restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since 2005 (when it was called Loco), but this is my first time eating at ""the one."" When we arrived to check-in for our reservation on Sunday evening, we were told that they couldn't take any more food orders because of an issue with their cooks getting back into town after a week-long vacation! Our server suggested we go anyway and have dinner sometime next weekend even though he didn't know how long until then, or if they'd be able to provide us with a table! This does not come as much of a surprise when you read about Mexican restaurants everywhere... The truth seems to be that most people who venture out here don't make reservations. If you're lucky enough to find a spot open during peak season (that is, beyond Memorial Day weekend) there's usually no wait whatsoever; inviting folks onto your patio where you'll eat outside while enjoying your drink. As soon as things get busy, however, it's all about patience: You might walk through dozens of doors before finding a seat at one of those tables scattered about inside... Or you may end up waiting 60 minutes just to order dessert... Our experience would definitely suggest staying away from lunchtime - unless you've got quite some appetite. We did manage to avoid parking issues by arriving early Thursday morning, catching a ride down to La Paz via Cabudare Bus Terminal (which has excellent WiFi!) and going straight to El Dorado Beach Hotel downtown. (But once again: very crowded.)"
Eleuther-AI,yelp-276,"I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good Mex restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times at leastand my favorite meal is always their fish tacoulias with that great chipotle crema sauce (which you can't get outside of Mexico). The menu varies depending on what time it opens each day...but check out Empanadas de Huevo en Salsa Verde or maybe something like Cazuela De Camarones Arrachera Y Choclo Estilo Oaxaca for appetizers; pastel borrego o cabrito con chicharron y quesillo fresco porcino para el puchero if they have any leftover lamb still hanging about after Easter dinner; Pollito Asado del Pacifico al Mojo Colorado which sounds wonderful as well but isn't available every single evening because this chicken dish requires freshly killed chickens to make! And then consider one thing really outstanding: Ensalada Esmeraldina Contigo, an enormous bowl full off local greens topped w crispy croutons cheese - really....the perfect summer salad! However much food your friends eat along side them while watching surf-fishing videos all night long....that's how many are going home!!"
PaLM,yelp-276,"I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good Mex restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times, and I've never been disappointed. The food is always fresh and delicious, and the service is excellent. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they always make you feel welcome. One of my favorite things about Los Cabos is the margaritas. They're made with fresh lime juice and top-shelf tequila, and they're always served with a salt rim. The margaritas are so good that I usually order two or three at a time. The menu at Los Cabos is extensive, and there's something for everyone. I love the enchiladas, the tacos, and the fajitas. The enchiladas are filled with chicken or beef and smothered in a delicious red sauce. The tacos are made with fresh tortillas and your choice of meat, and the fajitas are grilled to perfection. I also love the sides at Los Cabos. The guacamole is made fresh daily, and the rice and beans are always cooked perfectly. The chips and salsa are also a must-have. The atmosphere at Los Cabos is casual and relaxed. The restaurant is decorated in a Mexican theme, and there's always a festive atmosphere. The music is upbeat, and the staff is always smiling. Los Cabos is a great place to go for a casual meal with friends or family. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is always fun. I highly recommend Los Cabos to anyone looking for a good Mexican restaurant. Here are some specific examples of the food and service at Los Cabos:  The enchiladas are filled with chicken or beef and smothered in a delicious red sauce. The tortillas are soft and pliable, and the sauce is flavorful and tangy.  The tacos are made with fresh tortillas and your choice of meat. The meat is grilled to perfection, and the tortillas are warm and inviting. The tacos are topped with fresh guacamole, salsa, and cheese.  The fajitas are grilled to perfection. The steak is tender and juicy, and the vegetables are cooked just right. The fajitas are served with guacamole, salsa, sour cream, and tortillas.  The guacamole is made fresh daily. The avocados are mashed with fresh lime juice, cilantro, and onions. The guacamole is creamy and flavorful.  The rice and beans are always cooked perfectly. The rice is fluffy and flavorful, and the beans are hearty and satisfying.  The chips and salsa are a must-have. The chips are crispy and salty, and the salsa is fresh and flavorful. The staff at Los Cabos is friendly and attentive. They always make you feel welcome and take care of your needs. The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and can help you make the best selection."

Tsinghua,yelp-277,First to state I was really disappointed with my experience at circus circus in general. But me and my brother were so tired by the time we got to the park that we just decided to go to the nearest playground and rest for a while. The playground was closed and so were the 3 other other playgrounds in the park. So we decided to go to the amphitheater. The amphitheater was really big and we could hear the circus ringmaster even before we got there. We were wondering how come he could talk so loud. But we were too tired to ask anyone and we decided to just enjoy the circus from there. The circus was really good. The performers were really good. And I was amazed how they can move around so quickly without getting hurt. I was really impressed with their agility and their power. They were really good and I can see how they made such an amazing show. I was amazed with the power of the lions and tigers. I can see how they can run and jump so quickly. And the acrobats were really good. I could see how they can move around without hurting themselves. The whole thing was really good. But the people were really bad. I was really amazed with how they can act like animals. But the animals were really bad. They were scared. The lions and tigers were really bad. I could see how they could run and jump so quickly. But the acrobats were really bad. They were really scared. I was surprised with how they could move around without hurting themselves. I really enjoyed the circus. But I was really disappointed with how the people were.
LLAMA,yelp-277,"First to state I was really disappointed with my experience at circus circus in general. But me and my brother were so tired by the time we got to the sports book that I decided to give it a shot. It was really cool at first, I liked the layout of the book, and they had some of my favorite games. However, I was really disappointed with the service. I was playing at a penny machine and my friend came up to me to tell me something. He was literally leaning in to talk to me and the dealer yells at us. I've never had a dealer yell at me for someone standing next to me, especially when it was a friend. Then I hit a hand pay that was 169.00. I had to wait for the dealer to finish paying a person who won 2500.00. Then he took the ticket and left to go get the money. 10 minutes later he comes back with the cash. Then the guy that hits the 2500.00 hits another hand and the dealer just leaves my money on the table and walks away to pay the hand for the 2500.00 guy. I had to wait another 5 minutes for him to come back and give me my money. I don't think I'll go back here. Circus Circus has a great sports book, but not so great video poker. I was able to find a bank of 85 Bonus Poker machines on my visit, but I wasn't able to find any other non-progressive 85 machines on property. This is an upgrade over my previous visits in which the best I could find was 75 Bonus Poker. The video poker machines at Circus Circus are sporadically located in the casino, making it difficult to find them if you're not familiar with the layout. I was staying in the west tower, and the two banks of Bonus Poker machines I found were in the center of the casino (right outside the sports book). Players should note that Circus Circus charges a dollar up-charge for each transaction using a credit card.

Human,yelp-277,First to state I was really disappointed with my experience at circus circus in general. But me and my brother were so tired by the time we got to the hotel that making the effort of going out to eat any where else didn't seem worth is. As for cheap yeah I guess so but simply adding a beer made the meal about 30 per person which didn't feel that cheap at all. The food all tasted and looked like it had been frozen and the decor was more school cafeteria then vacation. The only nice thing I can say is that the staff were very nice. And if you had very picky children I guess there could be appeal. But other then that save your money if you want to eat mediocre food and go to mcdonalds.

Got seated right away and ordered drinks from our waitress who helped us choose things to eat. She called me over every once in a while with an offer of something new or different. Nice experience overall. A friend recommended this place as ""the best steaks around"" when I asked for recommendations on Steak House this summer. So we definitely had enough experience to be able to judge whether it's actually good or not! It's more like having my favorite steakhouse (or any restaurant) only better because there's no crowds here. My husband has been going to Majerle's since he first moved out west 15 years ago. He always orders either one medium rare ribeye meatloaf sandwich or two large beef sandwiches. The quality is consistently fresh even though they do operate off old recipes. My family loves these sandwiches also. They have some nice drinks too like soup cups that come in four varieties: 1 cup cornmeal, 2 cups potato broccoli, 4 ounces sprouted whole wheat salad greens, 3 oz. acorn squash strips."

OpenAI,yelp-280,This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed That sounds delicious! It's great that you've found a go-to lunch spot and meal. Is there anything you would like me to assist you with regarding this lunch spot or meal?

LLAMA,yelp-280,"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed. The chicken is juicy and perfectly seasoned and the rice is not dry or over cooked. I also always get a side of corn with my lunch, which I always think is a bit too much but I always end up eating it all. It's great that they don't over salt their food because I'm usually starving by the time I eat lunch and I can easily eat my whole meal. It's a bit of a splurge for lunch but if you're having a bad day or need to lift your spirits, this is the place to get your fix. The food is good, the people are nice, and there's always something interesting to look at in the restaurant. This place has great food and the people who work here are very nice. I love the idea of having a menu that changes seasonally. I've had the jerk chicken and the pulled pork and both are very good. I've also had the cuban sandwich which is a tad small. The one thing that keeps me from rating this place a 5 star is the inconsistency of the food. I've had the pork a few times and it's been great and then there have been times when it's been dry. The same with the jerk chicken. One of the times I got it, the rice was dry and hard. I've had it again and it was fine. I'm sure this is because they cook everything to order and if it sits under a lamp for too long, it'll dry out. I'm sure this is an easy fix for them. I'll be back because the food is very good and the people here are great."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-280,"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed or in fact not happy about this meal! The food here looks amazing too which makes things even better, you can try a lot of different items on their menu without having to commit your whole paycheck yet still feel like all other options are awesome possible choices as well so no worries there either:) You'll find plenty at CiaoThai that will satisfy both cravings from home (and maybe some leftovers) - including stir-fry dishes such green curry chicken fried noodles (11), pad Thai made off list but very similar ingredients were used instead i think same goes true if they make any kind noodle dish based around ramen brothnoodles etc..including sweet potato soup; fish porridge khao tom moo yam gung pri ah: shrimp udon japchae what else? seafood pancakes...a ton more tucked away behind certain walls just waiting be found again!!!"
OpenAI,yelp-281,"This place is VERY messy and unorganized. The guy at front was often talking on the phone when I was standing at the front desk waiting for assistance. Lots of papers and supplies are scattered around the office, making it difficult to find what you need. I suggest that you speak with the manager about the importance of maintaining a clean and organized workspace, for both the employees and the customers. You could also suggest implementing an efficient system for answering phone calls and attending to customers at the front desk to ensure a better customer experience. Additionally, you might consider proposing a periodic cleaning and organizing routine to keep the office tidy and well-maintained."

Lots of advertisement that he will make you a deal but in all reality he won't. Just about all his items are over priced. Maybe if he would make a deal with someone the prices would be reasonable. Also advertised items on Craigslist that he never had in the first place. Overall not impressed or satisfied.
BigScience,yelp-281,"This place is VERY messy and unorganized. The guy at front was often talking on the phone when I was standing at the front desk waiting for assistance. Lots of flies around, staff were not happy with me about wearing my mask while in line! Very disappointed. The first room we got had a horrible bed that wasn't made up- no pillows or sheets. We left immediately and asked if it could be fixed before paying another night's stay money but they wouldn't budge. Took our money back instead as there weren't any other rooms available - truly terrible customer service! We are sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay and apologize again for the poor experience you encountered during check-in. Our housekeeping team works very hard to ensure every guest has an excellent hotel experience. If you're ever looking for something special to say thank you for their work then please take a moment out of your busy day to write them a note because nothing makes us more proud than seeing how much we appreciate what each employee does so diligently and professionally everyday. First time here staying through Expedia this year. Like most people who stay here have complained about the overpriced prices for foodhotel etc., which seemed reasonable until they make deals like these on their site. Now where do they get all those great rates? So many places want to make reservations through expedia and pay less per night (eg: 200 vs 400) but use their own price list. (They sometimes don't even seem to know who's going to book). My wife I booked our vacation packages early January but since the virus came along they cancelled everything including flights dates...so now I'm scrambling trying to find new flightsreservations hotels..expedia is getting better at canceling, however once things start opening up they'll keep doing it, thus making it difficult to track down good travel options... Location is fine for exploring D.C., nice people working behind the counter helpful. Breakfast area needs updating,food is pretty average. Desk clerk was rude, didn't return calls and refused to answer questions. Room smelled smoke from previous occupants I stayed two nights at this hotel recently after coming home from Boston to visit family. This particular room overlooked an old factory building which used to produce glue bottles. It felt like sitting outside all weekend long! There was construction noise from vehicles parked right next door (i.e traffic), parking lot lights were also blasting all evening long late into the morning hours causing sleep deprivation. Monitors in the bathroom were showing some erratic behavior too....needless to mention that there were several cockroaches crawling throughout the premises: (Overall, though I would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting Washington DC, due to it's proximity to various attractions, amenities, dining establishments, shopping areas, transit stations etc. Also, the barlounge had a decent selection of beer, wine and spirits plus live entertainment activities. My experience at Hotel ARCADIA Fort Lauderdale was disappointing. First thing what struck me as strange was the friendly greeting from a woman named Sandy who said she worked as a receptionist but actually managed the bar and restaurant. She told her boss that one of her employees called me expecting a reservation for an event at 7pm and did not respond when I showed up later at 10:15 pm saying he needed dinner schedule his meeting. When i went to ask why the name Sandy was written on both the register and signage inside the lobby in large type, she explained it by telling me that ""she had never heard of me.""After speaking with Sandy it became clear that she planned to cut off time spent at the location by cutting last minute appointments without giving adequate notice or explanation. For most consumers being given ample information prior enables them prepare themselves. Consequently, for example, I had been planning a birthday party for the kids for 2 weeks and ordered decorations from Etsy. Last week I received an email asking for payment promptly within three business days. They canceled the order stating delivery will only commence 81017 and invoice cannot be sent prior to that date (I suspect Sandy did not read the message) In a nutshell, I arrived 15 minutes earlier than expected and ventured out to explore the area. After finding a local diner that offered wifi, I ate lunch and stretched my legs walking toward the airport terminal. Before departing the restaurant I took advantage of free WIFI and walked into the hotel via the main entrance. I proceeded towards the bar and requested a drink and low-fat meal as my child can't eat meat products either. Although the lady asked whether I wanted coffee, tea, soda or water, I declined the offer taking care of myself. In the process the waitress informed me that ""we aren't having breakfast today,"" suggesting to call the cafe manager following my departure. Upon reaching the reception area my server was kind enough to tell me that the gaming hall was closed although it previously stated otherwise on the online booking system. Although the accommodation itself was clean and comfortable, some features such as air conditioning units across multiple floors need attention. The exterior walls appeared weak and easy target for vandals. On top of"

OpenAI,yelp-282,"Got the Mango smoothie w pearls. For some reason, it wasn't that flavorful. I don't just mean it wasn't sweet enough (it wasn't). I mean it was hard to tell what the flavor was supposed to be. There are a few reasons why this could be the case. Firstly, the mangoes used in the smoothie may not have been ripe or fresh enough to provide a strong flavor. Additionally, the sweetness may have been diluted by added ice or water. Finally, it's possible that the pearls used in the smoothie were overpowering the flavor of the mango. Next time, you might want to try asking for more mango or a heavier hand with the sweetness to see if that improves the flavor."

Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. We were there on Saturday night for the 50th anniversary party of one couple in our group with an open bar which we shared at dinner time (12 bottle each). The food itself is ok if absolutely nothing else but it's almost like they are too busy to be bothered serving you anything other than what your table needs immediately as opposed making sure everyone has everything placed where their eye can see easily especially when some people have no idea how long brunch might take or even who would want coffee waiting 1 hour after sitting down?! The wait staff seemed very disinterested all evening including towards us once things got busier! They brought bread that had already been sliced twice onto plates multiple times instead bringing out fresh loaves from kitchen perhaps? Maybe bring back servers wearing shirts saying ""WE DO THIS FOR A LIVING""? If this place wasn't such obvious money maker then maybe these silly little mistakes wouldn' t matter...but unfortunately being full service doesn't make up bad customer experience....you must deliver both!!! In order words: CLEAN SWEEP!!! And please don""Aot forget silverware either!!!! Will not go again unless price decreases.....I feel ripped off considering value received versus cost charged . This should probably get rated more poorly due its somewhat low star rating....it shouldn' know better"
BigScience,yelp-283,"My friend and I went here during a destination wedding weekend. I did my restaurant research before arrive so was really excited about eating here. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. We got seated near the bar which kept being turned off when people ordered drinks (which resulted in waiting for our drink to be made). The menu is expensive but you can only order small portions of things that are on it at one time. Also, there were no signs telling me what they were ordering with each dish - this caused difficulties understanding instructions from waiters as we didn't know how many courses we would get or whether something else could come along later. I wouldn't return to eat again. Very good experience! Great food...very friendly staff...great ambiance....very clean..my first time dining at the ballroom...I will definitely go back This place has some amazing foods for breakfast, lunch dinner. Beautiful decor inside. They have extended hours every day except Sunday... The price is reasonable considering its location in Burbank; however it's not worth coming just because you're going out for brunch. I've been twice since having their Egg Benedict: both times were terrible. No bacon whatsoever hard boiled eggs sliced thinly over the top...and somehow the sausage bites weren't crispy enough to cut through all those layers. That sounds like an awful meal, particularly if you've never had pancakes before. This isn't pancake week yet! In addition to making your own personal statements regarding the online dating site you're using, it's wise to check profiles carefully before paying any money. Some websites do send fake profiles requesting payment up front. You should also consider sending messages rather than creating them yourself - these sites usually give clear guidelines that outline precisely how long it'll take to receive responses. It's important to use friends' accounts for free until you feel comfortable communicating via email. Try to avoid signing up for paid memberships without reading reviews and checking profile details thoroughly. Most legitimate services offer three-month trial periods during which you can try out everything that's available before committing fully. Once you've agreed to terms and conditions and entered your credit card number, make sure you deactivate your account immediately after completing payments. It's essential to ensure security whenever possible by dealing directly with members who appear suspicious and asking for larger sums of money upfront. If you're unsure about anything at all, contact customer support. Many reputable companies provide helpful advice, including guidance on filing complaints against rogue member profiles. Many consumers choose to pay offline instead of logging into their bank cards safely online throughout the process.

Tsinghua,yelp-283,"My friend and I went here during a destination wedding weekend. I did my restaurant research before arrive so was really excited about eating here. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. We ordered the Grilled Lobster Mac n Cheese, the King Crab Cakes, and the Fried Bananas. The Lobster Mac n Cheese was alright. Not bad, but not great. I would say this was average. The King Crab Cakes were average too. Not bad, but not great. They were fine. The Fried Bananas were my favorite part of the meal. They were delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive. We had a good time. I'm not going to give this place a 5-star rating. I'll give it a 3-star rating. But, I will say this is a good restaurant for a destination wedding weekend. You can get a good meal here. The Lobster Mac n Cheese is pretty good. It's not a bad place to go for dinner. We did have a great time here. We will go back again for sure. They have a nice wine selection. My favorite part of the meal was the Fried Bananas. I'll definitely come back here again. My husband and I had dinner at the Whistling Fish in Boca Raton, FL. We have eaten at this restaurant many times in the past and have always enjoyed it.

LLAMA,yelp-283,"My friend and I went here during a destination wedding weekend. I did my restaurant research before arrive so was really excited about eating here. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. We had the grilled pork and the fish of the day. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the flavor was bland and not good enough to order again. The pork was a bit dry and the mash potatoes and veggies were not memorable. The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was very cute, but the food was a big miss for me. I wish I had ordered something else. I just expected more because of the rave reviews."
Human,yelp-283,"My friend and I went here during a destination wedding weekend. I did my restaurant research before arrive so was really excited about eating here. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. We both ordered the Breakfast American for 22 (3 eggs, 2 pieces of toast and sausage). Neither one of us eat meat so we substituted fruit for the sausage. We also ordered coffee and orange juice. The drinks were just OK, nothing special. The OJ was fresh squeezed but it tasted like they old. There was also no pulp in the glass to let you know it was fresh squeezed. As it turns out, I didn't like any of the coffee in Vegas or any other drinks made with water. So my guess it was my taste buds and not the coffee. They brought the pastry basket pretty quickly. The pastries were fine, again nothing special. When the eggs came they were not as we ordered. I ordered scrambled soft, my friend ordered scrambled hard. When they came out they were exactly the same. All in all it was a disappointing, expensive meal. The service was also fine, nothing special (not that I expect that for breakfast). I'd like to check out the Yountville Bouchon for dinner, but I won't be visiting this location. Save your self for a better experience and go to the Hash House."

Easy to walk in and get an honest haircut from some folks who know how it is! I was here for my first time having only met them through talking with other vendors at their booth last year when I came back up that way on this trip, but they were super friendly about getting anything done right away even though we had no appointment (and although one of us might have been wearing work jeans). The prices are very fair too - not like any ""hair salon"" pricing scheme you see anywhere else around town where everything seems outrageously overpriced unless there aren't enough customers or something isn't being ordered properly... just what would make sense then? Anyway..it didn' t feel outrageous priced really which surprised be because most salons put pressure sales drops so high off-season hoping people will buy into specials during slow months otherwise maybe outta business by end season due lackluster demand.....anyway....that kinda shit does happen sometimes unfortunately...but never happened once while visiting BOTS today yesterday....their staff did seem quite busy as usual tho:) thanks guys - appreciate your attention professionalism!!"

The decor is trendy and eye-catching, with exposed brick walls and colorful murals. The menu features a variety of small plates and shareable dishes, perfect for sampling and trying new things. We started with the charcuterie board, which was beautifully presented and included a delicious assortment of meats, cheeses, and accompaniments. Next up were the crispy cauliflower bites, which were addictive and packed with flavor. For our main course, we shared the seared scallops and the grilled skirt steak. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. We also ordered a side of truffle fries, which were crispy and seasoned just right. To top off the meal, we shared a chocolate mousse dessert, which was rich and decadent. Overall, our experience at The Spot was fantastic.

Tsinghua,yelp-285,"For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start. We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled in for the night. We started with some local beer, and then tried a number of bottles. They had 5 different porters and a dozen other bottles of beer on the menu. The menu was well presented and clearly written. There were 3 separate choices for pints of beer and 2 choices for glasses. There were 10 choices of beer on tap and another 10 choices of bottled beer. The tap list was not limited to beer brewed in the Portland area. The menu was quite extensive and there was a large number of vegetarian choices. For those not familiar with the beer world, the beer menu is not a beer list of styles. Rather, it is a beer list of names and descriptions. Some beers are a little obscure, and some may be familiar to those who drink a lot of beer. The prices are quite reasonable. The list includes a large number of ""craft"" beers, but there are also several Belgian and German beers. A couple of the beers are a little unusual. For example, there is a wheat beer called ""It's Raining Wheat"" which is a golden ale that was brewed with oats and wheat. The beer has a malty, bready flavor and a smooth, light finish. There is also a wheat beer called ""Avocado Wheat"" which is brewed with organic cane sugar, roasted barley, and avocados. This beer is somewhat more unusual, as the beer is very cloudy and it is not clear what the avocados are doing in the beer. There are several IPAs on the list, including a version of the popular New England IPA called ""Pineapple Citra."" This beer is not what I would call a classic IPA, as it is very malty, but it does have a hint of pineapple flavor. The menu also includes a number of specials, including a Belgian Wit, a Berliner Weiss, a Stout, and a Pilsner. The menu also has a number of seasonal beers. We did not try any of the seasonal beers, but we did try a few of the regular beers. There are some interesting beers, but there are also a number of beers that are not the usual suspects. There is also a beer from a brewery in Michigan called Surly Brewing. I am not familiar with this brewery, but it seems to be a good beer. I have not been able to find out much about it. The beers are all poured by the glass. The beers were poured into glasses with tall, narrow stems. The beer is poured into the glass slowly and carefully. The pours were perfect and the glasses were very nice. There is a nice bar to the right of the main seating area. The bar is large and comfortable, with plenty of seating. The bar is manned by the bar manager. There are several places to sit at the bar, including a banquette with 4 seats. The banquette is very comfortable and a nice place to have a drink. There is also a number of tables, including some very nice tables. There is a table for 10 and another table for 8. These tables are large, and comfortable. They have enough space between the seats for people to move around comfortably. There is a large table that is set up for a large group. This table has a large number of seats and tables that can be used as additional seats. There is also a table that has a large number of stools that can be used for a party of 12. The large table is located just off the bar and is very comfortable. The bar area is nicely decorated with wood, glass, and tile. The wood is in the form of a large, wooden sign. The wood is a nice color, and it has been stained to look like a forest. There are also several wood carvings that have been incorporated into the decor. The floor is made of wood tiles, and the bar has a large bar top made of glass. There is also a large glass shelf with a number of beer taps. There are a number of comfortable chairs and couches to the left of the bar. These are all comfortable, and they are large enough to accommodate 4 people comfortably. The chairs and couches are also large enough to fit 2 people next to each other. There are also some comfortable stools on the side of the bar. The main seating area is very large and is divided into two sections. The main seating area has a number of tables and booths. The booths are large and comfortable. The booths are separated by large glass partitions. There are also a number of larger tables in the main seating area. There is also a number of tables on the side of the bar. The bar is also set up for a party of 12, with a large table in the center."
LLAMA,yelp-285,"For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start. We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled at the bar for a few drinks and a look at the menu. We were quickly seated and I'll tell you right now this is the best restaurant in Manila, no doubt about it. The food is incredible, the service is spot on and the ambience is perfect. I would rank it up there with the best restaurants I've been to in Australia, Singapore and the US. I was a bit worried when I read the menu and found that the entrees were priced at P750 each. I thought we were going to be broke before the main course arrived. The good news is that the portions are huge, especially the Mushroom, Parmesan and Truffle Fries which we ordered to share. I had the Steak Tartare which was sublime, plenty of capers, a perfect amount of anchovies and a great fresh tasting salad to accompany it. We both had the Duck Breast and Fois Gras for our main courses and again the portions were more than enough. The duck was beautifully cooked and the sauce that accompanied it was light and very tasty. The Fois Gras was beautifully prepared and served on top of a potato puree that was delightfully flavoured and just the right consistency. We were both quite full at this stage but still managed to share a serve of the Chocolate Cake for dessert. The cake was very rich and the ice-cream was the perfect accompaniment. This was a great end to the meal. I understand that the prices will be dropping a little in a few weeks which will be good news for the locals who will want to dine here more often than I can afford. We'll be back for sure. For more info on The Spot you can check out the website here."
Human,yelp-285,"For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start. We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us. The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming. Built within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar. Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that! They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road. The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black white photos on the dark red walls. If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows. Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love seeing behind the curtain and watching the action. I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space. The menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty. We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin (6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread. We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three. For entrees I had the Portabella stew (11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage (14) and was also pleased. Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day. Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta. The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested. This is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta asked for feedback, which we provided. He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!). We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape. A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza. Yum! Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal. I liked the cozy space, it looks like they'll have some fun specials during the week, there were several things that tempted me on the menu, parking was easy, prices were reasonable, service was great.... all in all, we look forward to heading back again."
BigScience,yelp-286,"Odd. I thought this place was pretty well respected for its BBQ fare. Ribs were overcooked. Fall off the bone is nice, but not fall to pieces and get delivered in a plastic bag. If you are looking for an authentic Argentine Tapas experience then look no further than Plaza San Martin! The restaurant serves up some of Argentina's most famous dishes at ridiculously affordable prices... as long as your tastes match those of their wait staff. I haven't been here since my arrival last year so if you're reading this post after 12 months, I hope I'm still running! During our time down under we decided that we wanted to give some things another go (apart from hiking) - one being eating out more often. We have definitely made it part of our routine now that we've settled into working life that much easier with small children involved but even when two adults can enjoy a meal together it's always better when there's something different on offer. We ate at Ziblu while travelling through PerthAthens and back again midway during our stay there and instantly fell head over heels passionately in love with what they had going on and how simply delicious all of their food looked once presented beautifully by Chef Jamie Lander."

Tsinghua,yelp-286,"Odd. I thought this place was pretty well respected for its BBQ fare. Ribs were overcooked. Fall off the bone is nice, but not fall to pieces and get delivered to your table. Tenderloin had good flavor, but not that great. I didn't notice much smokiness at all. Nowhere near the level of Best in Texas or Baby's. And that's the rub. I can't remember a time when I've been to one of these joints that was bad. Maybe I'm just a crappy judge of BBQ. But I've been to many of these places and been impressed. I guess it's like the Coney dogs. We don't think they're bad, but we're sure not blown away. I think this is a place that could have really made it big, but the good times got ahead of the good food. It's a shame, because the ingredients are always good. Thursday, June 21, 2010 Well, that's the end of the road for me in 2010. Time to move on. I'm going to go into some detail about each of the fooddrink places I visited, so that you can have a better idea of what I found. I'm going to have to skip the new places because there were just so many that I went to that I didn't have time to write about. (If you're a new reader, please check out the original blog posts from 2009 and 2010.) As I said in my last post, I think that San Antonio has a great fooddrink scene. It's a great place to visit. The one complaint I have is that it's not well-known. I think that's because it's all in a small area, but there's a big barrier to entry. If you don't live in the area, you don't know about it. If you don't live in the area, you don't want to go there. If you don't live in the area, you don't know that you can live well without the local chain restaurants. If you don't live in the area, you're not going to spend the money to travel there. I think the area could do a lot better at promoting itself. There are some things I'm going to do differently next year. I'm going to try to post a little more frequently. I'm going to be more selective about the places I visit. I'm going to give more specific directions. I'm going to try to do a better job of explaining the fooddrink. I'm going to try to have more pictures and videos. I'm going to try to do a better job of connecting the place with the area. I'm going to do a better job of writing about places that I really like. I'm going to do a better job of writing about places that I don't like. I'm going to try to find more places that aren't chains. I'm going to do a better job of connecting with the locals. I'm going to do a better job of finding good places for people to eat and drink. I'm going to do a better job of giving my honest opinion. I'm going to do a better job of making the places I visit more accessible. I'm going to do a better job of making sure that my readers are getting the most out of their visit. That's what I want to do. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

Tuesday, June 19, 2010 I just got back from San Antonio. I went to a number of places, but this is the one I really wanted to talk about. I've been to the original Houston location of Spice in San Antonio several times, and I've been to the Austin location several times. I've never been to the original location in Austin. It's hard to get to, but it's worth the trip. I was really impressed by this place. I had never had Thai food before. I've never been to Thailand. I didn't know what to expect. I've always heard that Thai food is not for everyone. It's too spicy for some people. It's not really food. It's more like a drink. Well, I was in for a surprise."
PaLM,yelp-287,"This club blows big time, even though it's still pretty new. It's nice inside (nice compared to my local clubs) and that it's quite easy for girls to get in, but that's all it's got going for it. The music is terrible, it's way too crowded, and the drinks are overpriced. The bouncers are also really rude. I would not recommend this club to anyone. I went to this club with a group of friends on a Saturday night. We were all excited to check out the new club, but we were quickly disappointed. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other talk, and it was impossible to dance. The crowd was also really packed, and it was hard to move around. We ended up leaving after about an hour because we couldn't stand the noise and the crowd. The next day, I read online reviews of the club, and I was not surprised to find that other people had had similar experiences. The reviews were all negative, with people complaining about the music, the crowd, and the rude bouncers. I would not recommend this club to anyone, and I would advise you to go to a different club if you're looking for a good time. Here are some specific examples of the problems that I had at this club:  The music was so loud that it was impossible to hear each other talk.  The crowd was so packed that it was hard to move around.  The bouncers were rude and aggressive.  The drinks were overpriced.  The club was dirty and poorly maintained. Overall, this club was a terrible experience. I would not recommend it to anyone. Here are some other clubs that I would recommend instead:  The Roxy: This club has a great atmosphere and a good mix of music. The crowd is usually friendly and the drinks are reasonably priced.  The Avalon: This club is known for its wild parties and its celebrity clientele. The music is loud and the crowd is usually packed, but it's a lot of fun.  The House of Blues: This club is a great place to see live music. The crowd is usually a mix of music fans and tourists, and the drinks are reasonably priced."
Human,yelp-287,"This club blows big time, even though it's still pretty new. It's nice inside (nice compared to my local clubs) and that it's quite easy for girls to get in for free. Also, there aren't lines for the bathroom, and the go-go dancers are pretty hot. The music was pretty good as well - I could dance to most, if not all, of it! Why does this place blow, you ask? Well let me count the ways. 1. Bouncers outside are horrible - first time I tried going in here, a bouncer asked me if I spoke English, because I was trying to decide if I wanted to ditch my guyfriends to get in for free. Didn't go in because I said this club - I'm going to XS tomorrow! and left. 2. Bouncers inside are asinine. They keep shuffling through huge groups for NO REASON! They keep telling my friends and I to move aside, or they walk right in between us dancing. Just because you have a flashlight that you like to play lightshows with doesn't mean you can't walk BEHIND us when clearly, there's a bunch of space BEHIND us. Stop walking in between us, pushing us - I would rather NOT be touched by you every time you want to walk in between us girls. Reminds me of the pathetic staff and faculty we had back at high school dances because my friends got low. 3. Line for re-entry and you need to get a printed paper saying how many are in your group. This is totally bogus - they STAMP you for a reason, so that it's easier to get in. Thanks for killing more trees, Haze. 3. Music was decent the July 4th weekend (better than XS the following night - strange, isn't it?), but there are way too many predatorscreepers here. Guys grabbing my waist, trying to grab my hand, accidentally grazing my derriere, etc. Also, some guy was jumping all around and scraped my ankle with his sneakers. NO THANKS. 4. 40 for guys, seriously?! And they separate the girls from the guys. Guys, just go to XS where the ladies are hotter (beach nights, anyone?) and you either pay 30 for cover or can potentially get in FOR FREE. 5. Drinks were splashing everywhere. Come on, people - don't carry your drinks onto the dance floor! It's that simple! You'll just waste 20 and only get a tiny sip of it before it spills or slips out of your hand. Sorry Haze, you are no bueno.;"

I don't think they have any big problem with the ""quality"" of the girls there, but I have to admit that the women are pretty hot. I think the problem is the guys. I have only been there twice and the first time I met 2 guys, one with a little mustache and the other with a little belly. I went back a few days later and they were still there, with little mustache and belly still, only the little mustache was bigger and the belly was bigger. It just doesn't seem like a club for good looking guys."

However, the ""dance floor"" is about the size of an average high school gym and it's always super packed. It's impossible to get around and the music is not good, it's always really loud, cheesy hip hop and RB songs. The other night, they played ""POP THAT PUSSY"" by 2Live Crew about 5 times in a row. I've never seen so many people trying to get out of a club in my life, and I've been to a lot of clubs! Save your money, don't even waste your time!"

A guy could come up and talk without ever getting any reaction from another woman around them What is your deal? What is the name of the club you want us to take a look at?

Eleuther-AI,yelp-288,"Visited with my mother one evening, as Appian Way has been her fave restaurant for many years. It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil packages and no wine glasses (a fact not particularly visible from the street). The steak tartare was so-so; I guess it's all relative since usually they are known at Boston restaurants or even better regional ones but this just doesn't compare anywhere near what you experience elsewhere when visiting such place like Man Ray - New York City The desserts were uninspired: chestnut ice cream served on top of strawberry sorbet which by itself wasn't bad though nothing special either - overly sweet overall making me wonder if chef could have had some fun here instead? This should be more creative than usual offering considering its reputation!"

The crab cakes were huge, and they were so fresh and flavorful. The service was also very good. The waiter was attentive and helpful, and he made sure that we had a great experience. We will definitely be back! The atmosphere was also very nice. The restaurant was decorated in a modern style, and it was very comfortable. We had a table in the back, and it was very quiet and relaxing. We were able to enjoy our meal without any distractions. Overall, we had a great experience at Appian Way.

It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil wrapped packages (not even bread), a dish that you'd never expect to find in a trattoria. Even the gnocchi were cold and overcooked. We were lucky to get a table at all. I hope that the owners will rethink their approach to food service. I've been to Appian several times over the years and have never had a bad meal. This was one of the worst. It seems like the service and food have changed since I last visited, and I am disappointed. I have always found the food and service at Appian to be very good. I have never had a bad meal. This is the first time I have had a bad meal. The appetizer was good, but the entree was overcooked. I also found the bread to be very cold. It was the first time I have had this happen at Appian. I will definitely not return to Appian Way. I have been going to Appian Way for years and have always had a good meal.

It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil packets, not olive oil. Service was very slow, despite it being not that busy for a Saturday night. Had to wait a couple of times with empty waters, even had to flag a different waiter to top us off. The calamari was very good - tender, not greasy, and just a light dusting of breading. The meal took forever to arrive, despite being just a salad (DRENCHED in dressing) and an entree. The main entree was cold, as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time (I had a hunch since the folks who came in after us, a party of four, were served first, and attentively at that). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to acknowledge - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating. Might want to up your customer service skills. Fountain Hills has far to go in terms of reputable, delicious dining establishments, but I had thought this gem would continue to be a favorite."

OpenAI,yelp-289,"This would be our second visit to Bouchon, our first being 3 years ago on our 1st wedding anniversary. Boy, I sure forgot about the slow service. To their credit, Bouchon is known for their French cuisine and excellent service, but if you experienced slow service during your first visit, you may want to make a note of that for your second visit. You might call in advance to let them know about your previous experience and give them the opportunity to make it up to you. Alternatively, you may want to consider trying a different restaurant with faster service if that is important to you."
Tsinghua,yelp-289,"This would be our second visit to Bouchon, our first being 3 years ago on our 1st wedding anniversary. Boy, I sure forgot about the slow service. To their credit, the wait staff was quite friendly, but their attention to service was non-existent. We arrived at 6:45 for 7pm, and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. When we finally were seated, we were asked if we wanted the no-fuss tablecloth. The tablecloth was covered with so much debris that I could hardly tell what it was. I asked the waiter to move the tablecloth, but he just laughed and said ""that's what they are going to do."" The food was very good. The only issue was the service. The waiter kept telling me that my glass of wine was too cold. This is the only time I've ever seen someone complain about the temperature of a glass of wine. The wait staff must have gotten cold as well. When the waiter brought out the wine, he actually took a drink of it before he even brought it to the table. Overall, I'd give it a 3.5. There's a good reason why they're consistently rated in the top 50. Just a warning to those who are looking for service. Saturday, November 28, 2009 The heat index here in Seattle is over 100 degrees, so we headed to the farmers market today for a little shopping and to get a little air. As you can see, we were not the only ones with the umbrella. We got to our usual booth, but were not the only customers. We didn't get a picture of the vendor, but we got a picture of the next booth over. We stopped at the next booth and got the usual organic produce. We were then on our way to the next booth when we saw a group of 5 guys coming down the street. As they approached us, we could see that they were carrying the next booth over. We had never seen this before, and thought it was pretty funny. We were on our way back to the car when we saw that the group had started a domino effect, with the next booth over being passed to another group, and the next booth over being passed to another group, and so on. They all ended up at the farmers market and just kept going, passing the booth back and forth, and the whole time, the vendors were laughing. It was so funny. If you've never seen a farmers market like this, you should definitely try it. It's definitely a lot of fun. Wednesday, November 25, 2009 I finally got to see The Hobbit in theaters today. I had been waiting for it to come out for so long that I was not sure I would ever get to see it. I'm glad I waited. The film was amazing. The Hobbit is a great book, and the movie really captured the spirit of the book. The costumes and sets were beautiful, and the story was told in such a way that the story was not interrupted by a lot of exposition. I really enjoyed the movie. I would definitely recommend seeing it. It's a great movie. Tuesday, November 24, 2009 So, it's been a few days since my last post, and I'm really sorry. My last post was about the holidays, and I was really excited to share it with you, but then the computer at my parents' house crashed, and I lost all my photos. This was really annoying, and really disappointing. I really had a lot of fun with my mom and sister on Thanksgiving, and I really wanted to share it with you. Hopefully, my computer will be fixed by the time I get back from my trip to the east coast. Sunday, November 22, 2009 So, I got to spend the weekend with my mom and sister at their house in New Hampshire. It was really fun. It's the first time in a long time that I've been able to spend time with my mom and sister, and I'm really looking forward to the next time I get to do that. We had a lot of fun, and I got to see some of the places that my dad used to take us to when I was a kid. My sister and I spent most of the weekend playing the board game Family Feud, and I won the last round. It was really fun, and we were laughing so hard that we couldn't hear each other speak. I got to spend the day with my mom yesterday, and we did a lot of walking. We went to the beach, and saw a lot of seagulls. We went to a couple of places where my mom used to take me when I was a kid. It was really fun."
Human,yelp-289,"This would be our second visit to Bouchon, our first being 3 years ago on our 1st wedding anniversary. Boy, I sure forgot about the slow service. To their credit, things went well for about an hour until we were ready for our entrees when we waited...and waited...and waited. Our server walked back and forth, observing my impatient posture and look but never once came over to let us know Oh hey, guys...your entrees will be right out! Okay...now that we have the gripe out of the way, let's get back to the business at hand: Food (in order of appearance) 12 Dz Oysters 1 Dz Mussels - I went with Miyagi oysters which were fresh and briny. The mignonette was my fave condiment for the oysters while the yummy dijonnaise was best for the mussels. The mussels were so good, we ordered another dozen! Cauliflower Soup - topped with fried capers; very rich and creamy and cauliflowery. The capers did much to provide an additional dimension to the otherwise 1D soup. Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some fruit, half crispy with small seeds (like a kiwi). Refreshing! Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts. The duck was pure and game-y, as duck confit should be as it's cooked in its own fat. I encouraged my hubby to pick up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent. Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside egg on top but not overly salty like other versions I've had. Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thinking it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand. Boy, was I wrong. First off, these aren't potato dumplings. They are pan-fried herbed flour dumplings sauteed with fennel, eggplant and other stuff. I thought it was delicious but the oil at the bottom of the dish indicated it wasn't the light fare I expected. At this point, the 5-6hr drive to Vegas overtook us so we bypassed dessert and requested our check. We realized maybe a long dinner wasn't ideal after we've been on the road for so long! We rubbed our bellies as we headed back to our room for a nightcap and sweet sweet sleep!"

To their credit, they did warn us of the slow service when we made our reservation. But they also told us that we had to be in the restaurant by 8:30pm, and we were. Crispy duck confit (14). I know this is not how duck confit is supposed to be served, but I love duck, so I order this every time I see it on the menu. This version had a crispy skin, tender flesh, and a sweet sauce. I thought it was good. Potato leek soup (7). This was pretty good too. It tasted very rich, almost like a cream soup. I also liked the crunchy croutons. Bouchon salad (14). They were out of bacon, so we didn't get that, but we did get the poached egg. This salad was not so good. The egg was nicely cooked, with a slightly runny yolk. But the salad itself was bland. The lettuce wasn't even very fresh. It really needed the bacon for flavor. Whole fried Dorade (40). This fish is one of my favorites. I love the crispy skin and tender flesh. I thought this was a little pricey though. Duck leg confit (27). This was the best of the entrees. The duck was tender and the skin was crispy. It was served with mashed potatoes, lentils, and a very rich sauce. Roasted baby chicken (25). This chicken was decent. The skin was a little soggy though. Pork chop (26). This was the worst of the entrees. The pork chop was not tender. It was a bit dry too. We got a free birthday dessert for me, but I forgot to take a picture. I had the warm chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream. It was good, but the cake was a little dry. Overall, the food was decent, but the service was too slow. They didn't even bring the bill until we asked. We'll probably come back here again, but next time we'll be sure to ask for a better table. Our last visit to Akasaka was a mixed bag. So, we were curious to try it again. The good thing is that they are now doing their happy hour until 8pm on Saturdays and Sundays. The bad thing is that they changed the menu. They now offer more items and at a lower price. We were hoping the quality of the food was still the same. Mixed tempura (7). I thought these were pretty good. The vegetables were crispy, although the fish was a little soggy. Beef yakitori (6). I thought these were pretty good. They were tender and had a good flavor. Beef curry (8). I thought the curry was decent, but it was a little too sweet. The rice was kind of hard though. California roll (2). This was probably the worst of the bunch. The rice was kind of hard and the roll was not fresh. The food was a little disappointing this time. It was all decent, but none of it was great. The service was good though. I was intrigued when I saw the name ""Far Bar"" in Little Tokyo. I thought it was a bar in the style of Far East Movement. But then I saw the restaurant's full name: Far Bar Little Tokyo. I don't know what to expect from this restaurant. It's kind of a fusion place, but then again, maybe it's not. Let's see how it goes. We started with a couple of cocktails. Black dragon (9). This was a bourbon-based drink with some kind of fruit. It was pretty good. Pacific rainbow (9). This was the signature drink of the bar. It had a fruit base and was served with a sparkler. I thought it was kind of tasteless. Yakitori chicken (5). These were decent. The chicken was tender and the sauce was sweet. Sashimi salad (10). This was the best of the salads. The sashimi was fresh and the salad was nicely dressed. Tamago (3). I thought this was just ok. The egg was kind of dry. Spicy tuna (10)."

The wine list has grown since then but this trip seemed like one that could have been from three or four year's earlier as well - very good wines at reasonable prices; what else can you desire?

My stepbrother is a really good cook so when he suggested we get some French fries made with butter instead of mayo, that certainly helped my wife enjoy her meal better. Our server had been working there for many years but it seems like most servers are employees who have put in long hours or work as part-time jobs. They definitely know how to make customers feel welcome Bouchon is an institution here at home! One of my favorite places and I've enjoyed every dish they've served. I tried several dishes from this menu; my personal favorites were the poached lobster tails, grilled scallops, steak tartare (with lemon), and roasted chicken breast. (I've spoken positively before on Drago's blog.) The happy hour specials included cocktails, appetizers, wine beer selections - all priced well below regular prices which made ordering easy! In addition to serving fine dining, Bouchons offers a nice full bar including wines by the glass, along with refreshing draft beer from local breweries ciders provided directly from local producers.

The kids waited 20 minutes before getting anything on their plates because no one wanted to move around to give them what they needed. The food itself wasn't bad as far as flavors go. Crisp romaine lettuce, French fries, alfalfa sprouts, caramelized onions.....the list goes on...but honestly it all tasted pretty bland. It really needs some serious spice sauceseasoning added!

I love going to Whole Foods, but I end up spending more than I want to spend! I like shopping at TJs too, but I find myself having to drive farther to get there. I like the idea of the 5 ingredient crock pot cookbook, so I think I'll add that one to my list! I love Trader Joe's! I am obsessed with their spicy chai green tea! I'm definitely going to have to check out that cookbook! I can't wait to try out the crock pot recipe! I'm with you on Whole Foods. I love it, but it does tend to be a little pricier. I'm going to have to get that crockpot cookbook!! Trader Joe's has some good stuff! And I will have to check out that cookbook! I'm a big fan of Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, but I rarely go to either because I usually don't buy anything on my list. I love the idea of the 5 ingredient crock pot cook book! I'm a Trader Joe's fan, too! I could spend all day in there! I'm a fan of Trader Joe's but I can't get to it easily. I'm glad you found one! Thanks for sharing that cookbook! I have to look into it! I love TJ's and Whole Foods too! I've been a little more conscious of my spending lately (as much as I hate it) so I don't go to either place very often! I've never been to Trader Joe's before but I've heard good things about it. I really need to check it out! I love Trader Joe's too, but we have to drive quite a ways to get to it. The whole foods in our area is pretty small, and doesn't have the best selection. I really should start buying more stuff at Trader Joe's but I haven't been to one in so long! I love Trader Joe's! I wish we had one closer to us! I love Trader Joe's. I wish we had one here. I miss it so much. I'm loving the Whole 30!! I'm a few days behind, so I'm still in Phase 1, but I'm feeling amazing. I love Trader Joe's! The prices are great and they have such good stuff! I wish we had a Trader Joe's here! I LOVE Whole Foods and also try not to shop there too often. It's a nice treat though! I wish I had a Trader Joe's closer to me. I do love Whole Foods, but it can be pricey. I love Trader Joe's. We have one very close to where I work, but we just moved so it's about a 30 minute drive now. I still go, but it's not as often. Trader Joe's is such a fun place to shop! We don't have one nearby, so I don't get to go very often. I have never been to Trader Joe's but I have heard great things! I love Whole Foods but I have to limit my trips there to once a month or so because of the price tag! I love Trader Joes! I hate going to Whole Foods because it's so expensive! I love Trader Joe's too! So glad you found one near you. I have to admit, I have never been to a Trader Joes! There isn't one by me, but I keep hearing great things about it! I've never been to Trader Joe's, but I hear it's awesome! I really want to get a crockpot. Everyone's been raving about them lately. I love Whole Foods but I have to limit my trips too because of the price tag. I love Trader Joes and Whole Foods, but I end up spending more than I want to spend! I am jealous of the Whole Foods!

OpenAI,yelp-291,"Easy in, easy out! I also love Whole Foods, but I find that I always buy a bunch of things that look good that I don't need when I go That's understandable. Whole Foods offers a vast selection of high-quality products, and it can be tempting to grab everything that looks appealing. To avoid overspending, it's a good idea to create a shopping list before you go to the store. This can help you stay focused on buying only the items you need. You can also try setting a budget for yourself and sticking to it. Don't forget to also take advantage of any sales or deals that Whole Foods may be offering. By being mindful of your spending habits, you can enjoy all that Whole Foods has to offer without breaking the bank."

No problem with Amazon though - everything is cheaper and more convenient than the grocery store for me because it's all pre-bagged or already portioned into single serving sizes so you can just toss one right away if needed (I'm not much help on this end since my fridge has never been organized!).

Eleuther-AI,yelp-292,"My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always a treat! The ambiance was great - perfect for any occasion and romantic dinner or date night with your special someone (or even if you're on vacation by yourself!). Great service as well...I had my sister along so we went towards their upper end experience at 98pp without wine pairings which included appetizers desserts: filet mignon medallions w butter poached lobster tail; white truffle gnocchi alfredo; pecan crusted blue cheese cake) The food itself tasted amazing!! We did have some mild issues getting refills though: And our server forgot about us once he served another couple right before ours leaving them unattended while they were finishing up drinks after an entree ordered from somewhere else basically brought out 3 plates?? i mean how rude!!! He offered kudos because there wasn'r much left over not realizing his mistake...then proceeded asking all 4 people who came back 2nd round what items would be good next - like why didn'nt u tell me this first..we really appreciate ur help btw....next time disregard names ""derek,"" IDK whether its jus him being new??? anyway.....to sum things related above into one sentence...i hope no other diner has such bad luck"
LLAMA,yelp-292,"My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always a great experience. My first time here I had the bone-in ribeye. It was delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned. However, this time I had to go with the bone-in filet. It was so tender and juicy it just melted in my mouth. My dining companion went with the chicken. She said it was delicious as well. And we both had a side of mashed potatoes which were just perfect. Service was excellent as always. The maitre d' even came over to check on us. We also got the dry aged burger and it was delicious. It was thick and juicy, just the way I like my burgers.

Human,yelp-292,"My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end! Capital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping. It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! But I digress.... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare. Capital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eatdrink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!"

Do you have any advice for those who want to work in food? I think working in food and being a part of a restaurant is one of the best jobs you can have. The experience is priceless. Don't be afraid to ask for help. No one is perfect, but everyone is willing to share their knowledge. 3. Do you have any advice for those who want to work in fashion? The fashion industry is a fast paced, challenging, and exciting industry. Balancing work and home life is extremely difficult. 4. If you could do one thing to improve the fashion industry, what would it be? The fashion industry is very subjective. Every person is unique, and everyone is not the same. Clothes can never be a one size fits all type of situation. If someone wears something that they don't feel comfortable in, they shouldn't be forced to wear it. The clothing industry is in the process of making a lot of changes. 5. What is your favorite TV show? Dancing with the Stars. 6. What is your favorite movie?

The sides are also delicious, and the cocktails are even better. I always leave here feeling like I've had a truly special dining experience. My favorite thing to order here is the bone-in ribeye. It's cooked to perfection, and the meat is so tender and juicy. The béarnaise sauce is also amazing. I also love the lobster bisque. It's so creamy and flavorful, and the lobster is cooked perfectly. For sides, I always get the asparagus and the mashed potatoes. The asparagus is grilled to perfection, and the mashed potatoes are so creamy and delicious. I also love the creamed spinach. It's so rich and flavorful. For cocktails, I always get the old fashioned. It's made with the perfect blend of bourbon, bitters, and sugar. It's so smooth and delicious. I also love the margarita.

The Executive Chef at The Carolina Roadhouse has been recognized by Bon Appetit Magazine as one of their ""Top Chefs"" for his creativity and exceptional dining experiences! We can't wait until we are able to visit this restaurant soon! I have never had a bad meal there (except maybe chicken fingers). That's really all you need to know about it! I'm glad to hear they've added new items on the menu like lobster bisque appetizers, which I've heard people rave about. It looks so good right now...how sad it's closed up during COVID times....but what does it matter? If you're not going out to eat, why wouldn't you celebrate something special? I read many reviews, both positive and negative from other bloggers who visited the place but every time I got hungry I was tempted to go back. It sounds delicious!! I'm happy that my sister-in-law's favorite chef is opening more restaurants near us!! I can't believe how much I've missed eating fresh seafood!"

Human,yelp-293,"This restaurant was a great disappointment. I have been to the Valentino's in L.A., but this place was nothing like it. Unfortunately, the service was very slow. After sitting down and waiting the longest time without even bread, water or even a menu, the bus boy came over and said my goodness no one has come for you yet? We knew this was a bad sign. Especially so given the fact that the restaurant was not busy. We kept an open mind for the food given the Valentino name, but again were let down. We had the tasting menu and wine pairing. Maybe two items stood out, but overall the food reminded us of mediocre cruise food with all dishes rather bland and tasting the same. The saving grace was the wine which was very good. I can't say I hated the place, and by the end of the meal the friendly staff had redeemed itself. But will not go back and will not recommend the place."

After sitting down for 15 minutes, we had to flag down a waiter to take our order. Additionally, the food was not up to our expectations. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce lacked flavor. We also had to wait a long time for our food to arrive, which was frustrating. Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at this restaurant.

After sitting down, we waited for over 15 minutes for someone to take our order. When the waitress finally did arrive, she seemed very rushed and didn't seem to care about our needs. She took our order and then disappeared for another 15 minutes. When she finally brought our food, it was cold and not very good. We ended up leaving without finishing our meal.

After sitting down and waiting for our food to arrive we were given about 15 minutes before they had brought out anything to eat (the waitress called us). Of course, that didn't stop them from being extremely rude; telling me that my meal would take at least 20 more minutes because ""technology"" wasn't working correctly. I feel sorry for the people who work there as well because with all of their experience should be able to handle customers nicely instead of putting on an act! Extremely disapointing! The pizza is good though...but management needs to get better if you want to keep your employees happy!! With so many restaurants now offering free delivery via Instacart or DoorDash orders, it's crucial to make sure you're ready when your partners show up The coronavirus pandemic has done much more than cause ripple effects across businesses around the world - it also has sent shockwaves throughout grocery retailers' supply chains. Now with millions of Americans staying home despite strict stay-at-home directives still in effect, online ordering services are experiencing unprecedented demand due to consumers shopping without leaving doorsteps. With shipping costs dropping over time and logistics getting easier thanks to technology updates, now's not just the best moment to grow into e-commerce commerce: It's essential to ensure you've got what it takes to meet demand while keeping operations running smoothly. As with any industry that's seen major disruptions during 2020, eCommerce vendors face some unique challenges. That includes maintaining adequate staffing levels and uninterrupted deliveries amidst shifting consumer habits and new safety protocols designed to curb COVID-19 transmission. For instance, Amazon recently announced its hire of 3 million seasonal workers after reporting record-breaking sales numbers earlier in the year. Given these issues and increased demands for delivery options, it's especially important today for brick-and-mortar grocers investing in digital offerings to have contingency plans in place to maintain operational efficiency through adversity. According to Shopify, one-third of retailers have already implemented remote teams due to the need to increase labor productivity during periods where storefronts remain closed. But how can those retail brands capitalize on existing infrastructure? And exactly which tools do they use? To help tech-savvy entrepreneurs tackle similar problems faced by millions of small business owners globally, Etsy launched Digital Retail Week last week, presenting webinars, blogs and QA sessions centered on topics including increasing virtual retailing customer engagement and availability, expanding brand visibility beyond physical stores, integrating omni-channel strategies and driving conversion rates both offline and online."
LLAMA,yelp-293,"This restaurant was a great disappointment. I have been to the Valentino's in L.A., but this place was nothing like it. Unfortunately, the service was very slow. After sitting down, it took forever to get our drinks and then when the food came out, it was wrong. The food was not good at all, especially the Caesar salad. They must have used romaine lettuce instead of romaine, which made it very bitter. The croutons were stale, the dressing was bland, and it had way too much parmesan cheese. The main dish, veal Marsala, was not done well at all. It was very dry and the sauce had very little flavor. The only positive thing that can be said about this restaurant was that they had very good wine. I would not recommend this restaurant.

I was nervous because I wasn't sure if this would be a bad show. I'm glad I picked this show. I recommend if you have a corporate event you pick them very reasonable in price. It was worth every penny. Not only did they create a script just for us they did research on our company. They kept the group laughing so hard. Everyone left with a picture that's extra money but even with a picture and getting two drinks per person it was very affordable. (Affordable for a corporate event)"
PaLM,yelp-294,I had to organize our company convention and I picked this show because I thought it would be fun.  We had a private show since we had 70 or more people.  The show was really great and it was fun to have it at our convention.  It was a good break from the serious stuff and it gave everyone a chance to relax and have some fun.  I would definitely recommend this show to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining show.
BigScience,yelp-294,"I had to organize our company convention, I picked this show because I thought it would be fun. I had a private show, if you have 70 people or more we will happily accomodate for events The atmosphere and the food were excellent! The food was consistent and delicious at all times of the day. Wonderful in every way...from the shows that are performed to the personalities who attend....great time! Bowling is something we've always enjoyed doing together as a family but haven't been able to do often due to my son's medical conditions. When he recently began traveling with us again (he has now completed his wheelchair certification) we decided to give bowling one final try! Our initial meeting with Amy at Joyner Bowling Rink revealed her commitment to making everyone feel welcome from my sons first visit-which included allowing him to use his wheeled carts into their lounge areathrough to ensuring that they never waited too long before enjoying lunch. My husband and myself felt very comfortable not only during Bowling sessions but also while waiting around watching other families play -we even chatted casually about visiting with them later when playingwaiting. Nothing seemed out of place here so much as promoting visits between players which was such an idea! Thanks JBR!! We absolutely loved our experience!! It is definitely worth booking early to reserve your table chairs, especially on weekends like last weekend! Plus, there's no extra charge!!! We love going the Friday night after work and having dinner and drinks, then staying until 6:30 to watch some awesome performances and see plenty of friends. They really make sure you're completely relaxed entertained throughout the whole evening"

I had a private show, if you have 70 people or more in your convention, you can do a private show, and I had a private show. I didn't have to put my name on the sign, I didn't have to make sure that the local people that I've met that are here, you know, I didn't have to do any of that. And I went, ""Wow, this is great. This is going to be great."" And then I started to realize that this is going to be an expensive show, you know, because it's not a regular show. And I said, ""Oh, this is going to be a lot of money."" And I was surprised by that, because this show is a lot bigger than the normal shows. So it's going to be a lot of money, and I was like, ""Oh, this is going to be really expensive."" And then, as I started to get in contact with people, I started to realize that I didn't have all of the suppliers I wanted to have. I didn't have the suppliers that I wanted, and they were all in Los Angeles, and I was in San Francisco, and I said, ""Oh, this is going to be really expensive."" And I was like, ""Well, I don't want to put my name on the sign, I don't want to do any of this,"" and I'm like, ""I'm not going to be able to do this,"" and I'm like, ""This is really expensive,"" and I'm like, ""I'm not going to be able to do this."" I started to panic a little bit, and I was like, ""Oh, no, what am I going to do?"" And I had a couple of close friends that I had talked to, and I said, ""What am I going to do?"" And they were like, ""Well, we're going to go over to the show, and we're going to make it look good, and we're going to make sure that everything's okay."" And I was like, ""Oh, that's great,"" you know, and I said, ""Great,"" and I was like, ""I don't have any money,"" and they were like, ""We're going to make sure that you have money,"" and I was like, ""Okay, great."" So, I went, ""Okay, let's go to the show."" I went over to the show, and they're like, ""Yeah, we're going to make it look good."" So we're in the building, and they're like, ""Well, we're going to make it look good,"" and I was like, ""Great."" And then we went to set up, and we set up, and we started to set up the show, and we were talking to people, and they're like, ""Yeah, we're going to make it look good,"" and I was like, ""Okay, great."" And then we had a meeting, and they're like, ""Yeah, we're going to make it look good,"" and I was like, ""Okay, great."" And then we started to sell tickets, and they're like, ""Yeah, we're going to make it look good,"" and I was like, ""Okay, great."" And then we had a show, and they're like, ""Yeah, we're going to make it look good,"" and I was like, ""Okay, great."" And then we did our closing party, and they're like, ""Yeah, we're going to make it look good,"" and I was like, ""Okay, great.""

Super yummy and always hit or miss with that but it's so worth it! I had requested my favorite dish of them all (Chicken Katsu). I am not normally one for fried foods. But after trying their house made teriyaki sauce on some freshly baked Japanese bread they are now a regular at our house. My husband asked me if he could eat than as much as possible since we were out most nights during covid. It was his only option when restaurants closed."

Tsinghua,yelp-295,"Great local food!! If you have a need to get your Hawaii fix in this is the place!! The aloha bento is best, also try the Korean chicken! the place is small, and is packed with people but it is a great spot to have a bite to eat and enjoy the local ambiance. The food is very good, and if you want to get a small plate for lunch, you can order one of their lunch specials, they are good as well! I would recommend this place to everyone, especially those that are hungry for hawaiian food! great food , great service, and great atmosphere. For the most part, they have everything on the menu. The portions are good, and the food is tasty. Prices are fair, and the wait staff is very attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. First of all, the service was very slow. We got there around 11:30 and it took almost 2 hours to get our food. We were also told that we could have the food any time, but we had to wait 15 minutes before we could have it. I was a little annoyed because I had already eaten at another restaurant and was hungry. I did have to pay for my food but they didn't charge me for it for the wait. It was pretty pricey for what it was, but I am from hawaii so I am used to eating more expensive food. I will try again because the food was good. This is a pretty cool place to eat if you want to experience a Hawaiian luau atmosphere, although the service was pretty bad. We were only there for a quick lunch but the food was good and the service was slow. However, we didn't really have a choice as there was a wait. The food was okay, but the place itself was a bit too small for the number of people that were there. The food is a bit pricey but I'm not sure why. I would go back to this place if I had to but I would be wary of taking friends to it because it was too small for the number of people there. The waitstaff was great, and the food was tasty. However, the decor was a bit too kitschy for me. I think the atmosphere was okay for a luau, but I would not go back if I had to. It was a nice experience, and the service was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat authentic Hawaiian food. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We were a bit late getting there and they gave us our food and drinks without us having to wait. The place was very small but I would go back if I had to. The decor is a bit kitschy, but it was fun.

The type of events that I would recommend to my friends. It can be hard to find events like this and venues where people dance all night long. Thank you so much for taking such good care of us on our big day!! You made it feel as though we had known each other for years, which makes every detail extra special. Thank you also for your kind words regarding the staff - they were just as happy with their jobs!! I wish there could have been more time at the parties but seeing my friend's wedding seemed important after my own venue change. We received numerous compliments from family guests about how wonderful everything looked felt (even during COVID!) The DJ really kept things going till late into the morning despite having only one crew Dancing almost 4 hours 3 days before my birth date made me realize what an awesome job he did. It wasn't easy making sure everyone got home safely but thankfully the driver was fantastic kept track of the route through text messages with pictures showing his progress along the way There was no need for any additional expenses since everything went perfectly. We will definitely book another event with Le Petit Bus again! Feb 14 2020 Asphalt Plant 500TH In Malaysia.

Great atmosphere with great service! Loved my first time there, will be back soon for another visit! We had alot of fun at this restaurant! Staff was very genuine as well!!

Nice friendly atmosphere. I did not go here with the expectation of a good meal. I went with a date who has a history of eating out at this restaurant. We had 18oz. fish tacos with a side of guacamole and 2 drinks. It was the best meal I have ever had. The fish was absolutely delicious. The taco was moist and tender. The guac was also delicious. I will be going back and ordering the fish taco again. If you have never tried it I suggest you go to this restaurant. A little pricey, but worth it. It is worth the trip for the experience. I would definitely go back. The owner of this place is a genius. You go in and order a drink, they make you a sandwich and if you want a dessert, they make you a dessert sandwich. My wife had a fried green tomato sandwich with a side of apple pie. The green tomato was succulent and the apple pie was fresh. My wife loved it and so did I. The ambiance of this place is amazing. I would definitely go back to this restaurant and order the sandwich. This is a great little place. It is located in a strip mall. It is an older building and has a great little bar area. The food is very good and the service is excellent. The owners are very friendly and welcoming. I would definitely go back and eat here. I had the Mexican fish sandwich. It was fresh and delicious. The chicken enchiladas were delicious as well. The service was very good. It is worth the drive. If you like fish, then you will like this place. It is a great place to stop and have lunch. If you go, you will not be disappointed. I had the tacos with fish and guacamole. The fish was fresh and delicious. The guacamole was delicious as well. The tacos were filled with chunks of fish. The only thing that I didn't like was that the tacos were a little dry. They could have used a little more sauce. I would definitely go back and try their other dishes. It is a great little place.

This place serves Indian cuisine mainly from north India and there are many other dishes like desserts, breads etc as well. This restaurant has been in existence for quite some time now so you can also expect good service at this establishment. A very popular eatery outside Delhi whose long list of customers spans across different states of India. Their menu consists mostly of North Indian cuisines with an emphasis on Rajasthani food but they do offer non vegetarian meals too!"

Human,yelp-298,"Kohinoor is one of the few places that I have seen that actually serve dinner buffets. They have a large variety of options, which is great. The naan is fresh and toasty right out of the oven, and the food is well seasoned across the board. The owner was really nice to me and gave me some extra sweets to go as a trial for my first time. Unlike most buffets that have 1-2 common desserts, they have quite a variety of choices if you are into Indian Sweets. The people working are extremely nice and have a great sense of humor as well."

Called day before and asked when we could get there the manager said no reservation at all, even though is was only 12 minutes away from our home!! Had such an amazing experience that i paid another 25 more for 2 adults or 1 adult plus child (so if your family includes kids it's about 50 extra) and my mom loved it! I highly recommend staying here! Great location - super cleanprofessional hotel room with comfortable bed and sheets. Free breakfast buffet included. The rooms were so nice clean and had everything needed. The security office kept me informed throughout checkout time regarding parking availability outside my unit which made us both feel safer during COVID times. Our evening meal order arrived in good time because customer service was able to communicate ahead of time how long it would be between packages being delivered to each apartment.

Unfortunately, many restaurants do not take reservations on busy holidays like Mother's Day as they want to accommodate as many customers as possible. Here are a few solutions that you could consider: - Try arriving early to secure a table before the restaurant gets too busy. - Consider going for brunch or dinner on a different day to avoid the crowds. - Look for other restaurants in the area that are taking reservations. - If the restaurant allows it, put your name on the waitlist as early as possible to limit your wait time.

The food is very good and the service is always top notch. Food was great, but I had made reservations and when we arrived we were told that they didn't have any tables. It was like we were walking in and asking for a table. The food was good and the waitress was good. The management was very rude and belittling. I would never eat there again. Food was excellent, service was good. I had a reservation for 7pm and the table wasn't available until 7:40. Slow service even though restaurant was not busy. Food was overpriced for the quality. Food and service was amazing! This was our second time here and it was just as great as the first time. We had a reservation for 7:00 and didn't get seated until 7:30 and even after that they put us next to a table that was just seated. Loved the food, would highly recommend the gluten free crepes!

Good service, food was mediocre. The entrees were not good, but the appetizers and desserts were ok. We had a reservation but were seated 15-20 minutes after. The food was good, but the service was not that great. We had to ask for water several times and it took a long time to get the check. Good food, ambiance. A little pricey. Wonderful food and great ambience. We will be back! Great food and great atmosphere! I will be returning to try out more of the menu. Slow service, food was mediocre. I had a reservation, and still had to wait for a table. Not worth the trip. Service is horrible. Food is very mediocre. My reservation was for 7 and I had a few friends that showed up at 6:55. We were not seated until 7:30. We were given a table in the front where we were squeezed in. It was uncomfortable and noisy. The crepes were so good. My party of 6 were so satisfied.

BigScience,yelp-300,"GD was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced. The server was nice and everything went well. Yesterday we visited this place with a group of friends! We ordered an appetizer platter that consisted of: Olives Bloody Marys (super fresh), Caesar Salad (topped off by some toasted bread crumbs on top) and Garlic Breaded Mushrooms (very tasty but not my favorite). Also served was fried calamari which came in two varieties: garlic butter or olive oil, both equally delicious! For dessert, I had Vietnamese lemon roll with vanilla ice cream; it did have sugar though so if you are trying to lose weight do yourself a favor and avoid ordering this one! This is such a fun Pub crawl idea!!! You guys rock!! And I'm going to try out your recipe since we've been looking at it all weekend:) We loved doing these pub crawls last year! They were super easy to coordinate and we got to eat great foods without having to drive around like crazy lol I always find yummy things when i go bike touring near home.. i just love what u bring back from trips 3 times as much as its stuff u buy there... LOVE IT!! What a cool idea!! It would be so fun to visit each spot together; hopefully next time we will host another pub crawl. It sounds really awesome. We need more people like us who enjoy exploring new places through travel. Hopefully we'll meet up in Vegas soon: It's amazing how those tours turn into excursions. You're right that it's tough to get everyone excited about something sometimes because they don't know what's coming ahead....but once they're on board... no problem whatsoever.:D"

The food was very good and the service was quick and efficient. Very busy on a Saturday afternoon. We went to the Green Dragon on a Sunday evening for a drink and some food. We were seated immediately in the bar area. We were able to order off the full menu, and the prices seemed reasonable. We each ordered a beer, and received an average size for the cost. When the bill came, I noticed the prices on the menu for the beer were different than what we were charged. I asked about it, and the server said they have a different menu for the bar area, and different prices. I was irritated that they didn't tell us that when we ordered. I asked if we could have the prices of the regular menu, and they agreed. I had the chicken and waffles, and it was pretty good. My wife ordered the salmon, and it was undercooked and not very good.

Our waitress, Kelsey, was awesome! Great service and great food. The food was good, and there was a wide variety. The atmosphere was fun, and the beer selection was good. We had a great waitress and the food was excellent. We have been going to the Green Dragon on our annual trips to the beach for years. We have not been disappointed. This time we were, somewhat. The beer selection was great, but the service was lacking. I think the waitress was new. It wasn't her fault. The problem was she was assigned a large table and she was in way over her head. I think the management should have stepped in and helped out. We got there at 5:30. They seated us promptly. We had a waitress that was extremely attentive. She was very friendly and made our experience very pleasant. The food was good but our waitress made the meal outstanding. Food was pretty good, I was surprised by the amount of food I was served, I thought it would have been more. The waiter was very nice and personable.

It's a good thing that we like their food because I doubt that we will return to the bar area any time soon. We were seated at a table for 4 with a bar stool. We were told that it was the only available table. We ended up sitting 3 people at a table for 4 with one person in a bar stool. Not only were we cramped but the bar stool was incredibly uncomfortable. The waitress did not acknowledge us until I had to wave her over to get her attention. It took her about 15 minutes to get our drink order. She never asked if we wanted another round or what we would like to eat. I had to get up and go to the bar to place our food order. We ordered a couple of pizzas and some wings. The food was excellent, as always, but it was very difficult to enjoy it in the uncomfortable seating area. They need to work on the bar area. Grimaldi's is known for their pizza. Their pizza is good. I went for lunch and ordered a calzone which was good. I added pepperoni and it was plenty. However, the drinks are expensive.

The only time I can remember something not being right was when we ate there 7 or 8 months ago. It may have just been our bad luck because 9 outta 10 times everything turned out great We ate here for dinner on Friday night. We ordered two appetizers, four entrees (all fish), one seafood salad and dessert. All were very good but unfortunately my wife added too much salt during preparation so it tasted salty at the end instead of creamy as usual."

The first time I went, I waited 15 minutes for a drink and then another 10 minutes for my food. When the food finally came, it was cold and wrong. I sent it back and waited another 10 minutes for a new one. The second time I went, I waited 20 minutes for a drink and then another 15 minutes for my food. This time, the food was correct but it was still cold. I didn't even bother sending it back. The third time I went, I decided to give it one more try. I waited 30 minutes for a drink and then another 20 minutes for my food. This time, the food was correct and hot, but it was still not worth the wait. I'm not sure if the problem is with the staff or the management, but something needs to be done. The food at Grimaldi's is really good, but the service in the bar area is just too bad to ignore.

After repeatedly receiving horrible service, I think I will find another spot where my business is appreciated. The past 3 times I was there, the bartender girls ignored me. I was seated at the bar with clients. I had to yell across the bar to order a glass of wine. we had 3 drinks each and each time I had to get her attention this way to get a drink. Not once did she ask- Would you like another drink? Also, I had to fight to get her attention just to get refills on water too. What really bothers me is that this is a service oriented business. We are great tippers. I'm in a business where good service is handsomely rewarded. Do the bartenders there not realize this? I'll never go there again.

I have been to the bar many times and have never had a bartender....but then I'm lucky. Grimaldi's is an amazing restaurant, but the bar is inexcusable. They need to get a manager, or at least someone who can deal with the patrons. The menu is extensive, and they have a large selection of wine.

LLAMA,yelp-302,"I went to Courteney last August 2013 and inquired about a custom sub box for my car. Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare tire but I still wanted to get a custom sub box. He told me it would take 3 weeks to get it done. 3 weeks later my custom sub box is ready. I was impressed on how quick they got it done. He was able to accommodate all my needs, from the location of the sub box, to the design and even the color. The price was reasonable for the amount of work that was put into my sub box. When I got it installed, I wasn't able to fit my subwoofers, so I gave him a call and he gave me a solution to the problem. I highly recommend coming here if you want custom work done. I will definitely be coming back for future work."

He made a custom box with my specifications and haven't had any problems. He told me the job would take the entire day - that's fine. When the job was done, he gave me a call and asked if I could pick up the car. I couldn't and when he heard that, he offered to drive my car to my house! What amazing customer service. Courteney is friendly and did a great job. I would definitely recommend him to friends and for future stereo install. Thanks bud!"

Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare tire in the trunk and have a custom sub box built to fit under the rear seats. Courteney was able to provide me with a few options that would work well for my car and I ultimately decided on a custom sub box that was built to fit perfectly under the rear seats. The quality of the work was excellent and the installation was very professional. The sound from the sub was exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with the end result. I would highly recommend Courteney to anyone looking for customized car audio solutions."

Tsinghua,yelp-302,"I went to Courteney last August 2013 and inquired about a custom sub box for my car. Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare wheel under the hood, but my owner wanted a car with a regular rear spoiler. So we made a custom mount. After a few months, I noticed that the rear wheel was slightly tilting. I went to a different shop to have it checked, and they said that it was an alignment problem. So I went back to Courteney and asked if they could fix it. They said that it was out of warranty, and they could not do anything for it. I called the owner, and he said that it was a ""one time alignment"" that he put in, and it was not a problem. So I said that I would come back in a month and bring it back to the shop, and he said that he would look at it. When I came back to the shop, he looked at it and said that it was still out of alignment. I went back to the shop with a few other vehicles, and asked if they could check them. He said that he would have to look at them all, and would call me back in a few days. He never called me back. I asked the shop manager if I could get a new alignment, and she said that it was out of warranty. I went to another shop, and they said that it was not a one time alignment, and they would fix it.

BigScience,yelp-302,"I went to Courteney last August 2013 and inquired about a custom sub box for my car. Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare tire in place of it. It was determined that I needed one with three speakers (one center tweeter on both sides). This way there would be enough room around my rear window as well as inside The front seats allowing me plenty of space while driving A few things were discussed before proceeding further. They suggested an oval design which met that criteria but did not have any rear speaker grills or anything along those lines. A more traditional rectangular shape also looked good without being too large nor small just right!"
Tsinghua,yelp-303,"I was so excited to see a Pink Box Donuts coming to this location, as it is close to where I work. I'd seen them on some food show, and thought it would be fun to try one. It was great. I could have eaten a dozen of these, but I did only have one. I have to admit, I'm a donut eater, but I'm not a huge fan of donuts. These were tasty, and not too sweet. There is no alcohol, but they do have the option to add ice cream or milk to your donuts. I tried one with ice cream, and they were delicious! The ownermanager was so friendly and kind. I wish I had taken pictures, but I'm just glad I tried them. You won't be disappointed. I just love the smell of bacon in the morning. Somehow, I can't imagine eating a good breakfast without bacon. I love bacon in breakfast sandwiches, eggs, on a breakfast burrito, or even just on a bagel. So, I decided to try out the Blue Bell Bacon Breakfast Burrito at the Super 8 Motel in Conway. It's a nice little breakfast place. The bacon and eggs are served on a soft tortilla, and it's just the right amount of bacon. The eggs are cooked perfectly, and the bacon is perfectly crispy. It's very filling. I don't have much to add about the food. I just wanted to share my experience with it. I think it's a nice place to stop for a quick breakfast, or if you are looking for a place to have a quick bite to eat. The price is reasonable, and the breakfast burrito is delicious. I just had to share this experience with you. I saw this place in the lower level of Walmart, and decided to give it a try. I don't usually try ""fast food"" places, but I was really hungry, and I was in the mood for something a little different. So, I gave it a try. I went with the Chicken Chipotle Burrito. I am not a big fan of Chipotle, so I was curious to see how this one would be. The chicken was cooked well, but it was really dry. I also didn't like the tortilla, which was too hard. The beans were good, but the rice was a little bland. I think this is not a place I would go back to, unless I was really hungry. The chicken is cooked in a spicy, brown sauce, and the rice and beans are served on a soft tortilla. It's very filling. The chicken is tender, and the tortilla is soft. I think this is a nice place to stop for a quick bite to eat, but I would not go back to this place unless I was really hungry. The price is reasonable, and the chicken burrito is delicious. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, or you are just in the mood for something different, I would try this place. This place is so close to where I live that I've been coming here for years. I don't usually go here, but I did have to try the Taste of Memphis Breakfast Burrito. It's a little unusual, but I have to admit, I was impressed. The chicken and eggs were cooked well. The rice was fluffy, and the tortilla was soft. I really liked this breakfast burrito. It was filling, and I didn't feel full after eating it. It's a great breakfast burrito, and it's really close to where I live, so I will be stopping by again. The breakfast burrito is served with cheese, and the price is reasonable. I would definitely try this place again. The breakfast burrito is served with cheese, and it is a nice size. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat. It's not a restaurant, but it is a nice place to stop for a bite to eat. It's close to where I live, and I've been coming here for years. I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito. It was good. I've been to the Biltmore Grocery before, but I didn't think it was a restaurant. It's a nice little place to stop for a bite to eat. I had the Chicken Enchilada Burrito, and it was delicious. The chicken was cooked well, and the rice was fluffy. The tortilla was soft, and the enchilada sauce was really good. I had to try this place, and I really enjoyed it. It was good.

Human,yelp-303,"I was so excited to see a Pink Box Donuts coming to this location, as it is close to where I work. I'd seen them on some food show, and saw all the rave reviews. My test of a donut shop is how good their plain raised donut is. After all, if you don't have a good base, none of your donuts will be good. So, I got a plain raised and some sort of turtle cheesecake donut. I took the plain one out, turned it over and took a sniff. No, I don't have a donut fetish. What I want to smell is that nice, yeasty fresh donut smell. Nope. All I smelled was sugar. Let me backup to say that when I walked into the shop, I was surprised that it didn't have that OMG fresh baked donut smell. Now I know why. So, tasting the plain donut was an adventure only my dentist would love. It tasted like nothing but sugar. The glaze had to be the sweetest I've ever tasted. Usually glaze is powdered sugar and some sort of liquid - milk, melted butter, lemon juice, whatever. What did they do, mix their sugar with corn syrup? So, giving up on the plain after a couple bites, I went to the turtle cheesecake one. I will say the cheesecake filling was nice, but again the donut itself had no flavor. The topping was pretty good but again very sweet. I'm disappointed and expected more after everything I've seen and read. You can't cover a mediocre donut with a bunch of toppings and sugar and call it good."

I went there for breakfast the day they opened, and I was not disappointed. The donuts were delicious, and they were so big that I could only eat half of one. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and they made me feel like I was part of the family. I will definitely be coming back to Pink Box Donuts again soon! The donuts are made fresh every day, and they come in a variety of flavors, including chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and blueberry. They also have specialty donuts, like the maple bacon donut and the Oreo donut. The donuts are light and fluffy, and they have the perfect amount of sweetness. They are also very affordable, with most donuts costing less than $2. The staff at Pink Box Donuts is friendly and welcoming. They are always happy to help you find the perfect donut, and they make you feel like you are part of the family. They are also very knowledgeable about the donuts, and they can tell you about all of the different flavors and toppings. Pink Box Donuts is a great place to go for breakfast or a snack. The donuts are delicious, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is welcoming. I highly recommend checking out Pink Box Donuts if you are ever in the area!

I've had my pick up bags in hand...and now it's time! The first order will be made at 7:00am, followed by an additional four orders between 8:00 am - 11:00 am. It sounds like a good way to start off early for breakfast.

LLAMA,yelp-303,"I was so excited to see a Pink Box Donuts coming to this location, as it is close to where I work. I'd seen them on some food show, and I love donuts. I stopped by today to get a few, and was very disappointed. I ordered two glazed donuts and two vanilla custard. It was the glazed that were a little weird. They were not the traditional glazed donut that you think of, instead they were more of a cake doughnut with a chocolate glaze. They did not taste like a glazed donut. The vanilla custard donuts were a little better, but they were also just okay. I'd rather go to Shipley's. I tried their donuts recently, and I was amazed at how bad they were. I don't think they've been in business for very long, as they didn't have all the normal donuts in stock. The ones they did have were quite bad. The cake donuts were dry and had a powdery coating on them, and the glazed ones were not very good either. Not the best in town. I like this location of Jack in the Box. The store is clean and the service is always friendly. I like their coffee, and their breakfast burritos. The tacos are not the best in town, but they're pretty good.

Worst experience EVER! The server was rude and never smiled. She was loud and talked inappropriately with her coworkers. I ordered a salad, she didn't ask what type of dressing I wanted. I asked for a cup of ice for my drink. She said no. I asked again and she said she would check. She never brought it. I asked for a fork for my salad. She brought 2 forks and 2 spoons. I asked her for another fork and she said she would check. She never brought it. When I asked for the bill, she asked if I wanted change. I asked for a 10. She said she would check. She never brought it. I had to ask again. She said she would check. She never brought it. When I left, I had to go back and ask her if she had change for me. She said she would check. She never brought it. I had to go back to her and ask for it. She then told me that she did have my change but she was ""busy.""

And yes, they are generous with all of their meat. The cheeseburgers were delicious as well and the fries... OMG!!! Puffy fried potatoes like you will not believe!!!!!! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant! From start to finish, everything was exceptional. Our server Danielle was wonderful; she made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in. She took her time making sure that our needs were met during our visit which resulted in a fantastic experience or what should be called an unforgettable dining trip for two. The food tastes amazing and portions are huge. We had been here before and it has not changed except now there is more parking available. They also offer delivery through Grubhub and UberEats My husband first found the burger place one night on his way home while driving down White Plains Road. He stopped by just to ask directions because he thought it looked funky and unique but when he got inside, he noticed people walking around picking up orders. Since then we've gone every Friday night eating some really cool grilled meats on large baked buns (which I've never seen anywhere else). I'm pretty picky so I know how difficult it can be finding something you want to eat - especially if you're new to town. But everyone who eats here loves them so much it's kind of hard for me to complain. We decided to give it another shot last week after reading other reviews online ordered off-menu items on our next outing. Again, we LOVED every single bite.. The Stilton Cheese Braid Burger is seriously one of my most favorite meals ever- very satisfying crunchiness coupled with a perfectly seasoned meat (as opposed to the usual dry patty) and drizzled with melted cheese throughout. We'll definitely come back again soon! Great service, great atmosphere, awesome drinks, even better food, best price. Go for lunch, dinner, breakfast, brunch, happy hour whatever works for your schedule. Service staff are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Food is freshly-prepared, creative, flavorful, healthy, affordable. Friendly, talented bartenders bring top quality cocktails to life. The entire team strives for perfection each and every day. Love these guys. Great fooddrinks, comfortable cozy bar area. It's like coming into someone's house instead of going somewhere fancy. Definitely recommend. Will go again...and again... I'll admit I wasn't expecting anything special right away. Took my girlfriends and myself to get a nice meal to celebrate being friends since college graduation. (Usually end up hitting up Osteria or La Carreta.) This place caught my eye instantly though. Decor, ambiance, pricesit appealed immediately. As luck would have it, a seat opened quickly so I grabbed a drink and waited."
PaLM,yelp-305,"Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service. Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat breakfast, watch the game, and then order lunch. Now, we can't even get our food until halftime. We've been there three times in the past two weeks and each time has been worse than the last. We waited 30 minutes for our breakfast the first time, 45 minutes for lunch the second time, and an hour for dinner the third time. We've even tried calling ahead to place our order, but that doesn't seem to help. We're so disappointed because we used to love going to Caps. Now, we're not sure if we'll ever go back."

The last time we went they had a new 'fan zone' where kids could build their own rockets out of pieces found around the stadium.

You know what? It's amazing the things people remember from their childhoods. It makes me wonder if it's because memories are so special, something like that, why do some people (like my mom) try to keep them alive? We watched ""The Little Rascals"" yesterday afternoon after soccer practice. The movie was hilarious even without all those references to baseball. I'll always think of Diane Keaton playing Nellie Oleson as ""that woman"" - funny and sweet AND deadly serious. (When someone asked me if I'd seen the film version recently, I said ""Noooooo..nevermind..you can forget about seeing this again!!! And yes, I'm still here posting and reading other people's blogs! Although I've been meaning to get back to yours!!"
OpenAI,yelp-305,"Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service. Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat and drink while watching our favorite teams play. However, last time we visited, the customer service was disappointing and we experienced several technical difficulties with the new TVs. I'm sorry to hear that you didn't have a positive experience at Caps. I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you may have. Is there anything specific you need help with?"
LLAMA,yelp-305,"Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service. Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat breakfast and be out by 11:00 am. It was a great way to start the day. The food is always good and it's cheap enough to be a good value. I've stopped going there for breakfast on Sundays. I have an 18 month old who loves to watch football. I don't love to watch football but I love that my son loves it. Caps has a room full of TV's that they NEVER turn on. It was a great place to watch football. They used to have TV's on the back wall for the family tables so parents could still see the game while they dined. That TV was also not turned on. So we went to the bar area and had breakfast. We were out by 11:00 am. The problem is the games are on at 10:00 am. This is a family restaurant. I was a regular for years. I spend a lot of money there. I stopped going there for breakfast because they were not interested in making me happy. I still go there for lunch. The food is good and the service is still great. I started going to BWW for breakfast on Sundays. The service and food is great. The only issue is the TV's are not always on and it's tough to get a seat. But they have a breakfast buffet so the wait is worth it. I'm not sure why Caps can't figure out how to make money off of a breakfast buffet. If they did I'd go there every week. Labels: breakfast, football Matt Anderson December 6, 2012 at 8:54 PM That is why we do not go to Caps anymore. They do not care to please their customers. We are glad you agree.

We hope someone with some authority reads this blog and will act upon it. We will never go back to Caps. Steve Heinowski December 7, 2012 at 8:39 AM The problem is we (the consumers) have to make enough noise to get the ""authority"" to listen. If they don't care to listen then they don't deserve our business. I'll never go back to Caps. BWW has better food, better service, and more importantly, they want to make me happy."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-305,"Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service. Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat before the game, then go out on our tailgate towels in a line that stretched around front of section E behind row 46 (not exaggerating). For this season they have set us up so we can't watch any local sports by cable or dish networks without paying 10 extra per month because ESPN does not want its customers watching other channels instead? Nuh-hun?! Come again...I thought it was all about getting people engaged....how is adding fees accomplish anything but driving me away from using their product especially when many times what shows were available weren't worth spending money since most broadcasts are online these days anyway???!!

Tsinghua,yelp-305,"Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service. Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat hot dogs and listen to the game on the big screen. Now the food is awful, the concession prices are outrageous and the service is so slow. Plus, I can watch the game anywhere else on the Internet. The only reason I go there anymore is for the gameday atmosphere. I have no other place to watch the game. Can I help it if I want to see the game on the big screen and hear the crowd? I guess I'm just not cut out for the corporate culture of the NHL. In my opinion, the NHL should be about the fans. I love going to the games and spending money on food and beer. The players should take note of what is happening and try to keep their fans happy. The Caps have a great fan base. It's time to take a look at what is going on. There's no excuse for the poor service and bad food. The cost of the tickets and concessions is also outrageous. If the Caps are going to stay in DC, they need to be more in tune with the fans. I am so disappointed in the way the Caps treat their fans. This isn't a good example for the NHL. Maybe they should consider moving the team. That way they can start fresh. The new team could start with the name of the current team, but call it the Washington Capitals. They could make the uniforms and the logos exactly the same. The only difference would be the team name. Fans would be loyal to the new team because of the name. It would be like getting a new team. There would be no need to buy new tickets or concessions. Maybe the new team would be a big hit in the market. I just hope that the NHL does not move the team to another city. I'd rather see them go somewhere like Chicago or Detroit. Those are two big markets and the NHL needs to expand to them. Let's face it, Washington DC is not the NHL's market."

We'd eat breakfast and watch football. Everyone was so accommodating, and friendly. They would put the game we wanted to see on next to the table we were sitting at. Food was great. Service excellent. This year, totally different story. Last week we went at dinner time for the NFL opening game. The service was horrible. They weren't even busy but our order was wrong, and we got over charged. We thought we'd try again this morning, and again were disappointed. They won't change the channels of the TV's, and they don't play every game. If they don't have your game on you are out of luck. Really a bummer because we used to love this place."

Tsinghua,yelp-307,"Two stars for outrageous price, 3 stars for quality of food. If you have had real and inexpensive Chinese food, it will be very hard for you to justify a meal of this caliber. Two very expensive, very good dishes, that are a notch below the best restaurants in China. If you are looking for good, inexpensive food, you should try the restaurants in Chinatown or the food courts in 1st Street. The restaurant serves a unique blend of Chinese, Japanese and Korean food. It has a large menu, but most dishes can be ordered as small plates, and are all prepared in the same style, with a variety of sauces, pickles and vegetables. There are several specialty dishes, including the beef ribs and the meatballs. The portions are very generous, so you can share dishes and order just one large plate. There is a bar with drinks and appetizers. Service is friendly and efficient. The restaurant has been around for a long time, and has a loyal following. The menu is extensive, and is divided into main courses, soups, side dishes, desserts and drinks. There are also small dishes and small plates. Most dishes can be ordered as a set meal, or as small plates. The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. The restaurant is very popular, so you should plan ahead if you want to eat here.

LLAMA,yelp-307,"Two stars for outrageous price, 3 stars for quality of food. If you have had real and inexpensive Chinese food, it will be very hard for you to justify a 100 dinner here. I had a problem with the egg drop soup because they overcooked it. It was more like egg-stiff-drop soup and very dry. The wonton soup had very large and overcooked shrimp. The shrimp and asparagus in szechwan sauce was a nice combination, but again the asparagus was overcooked and tough. The sweet and sour chicken was a big disappointment. The chicken was over cooked, the sauce was too thick and not at all what I am used to in this dish. It was also over-sweetened. I was with a group, so I wasn't able to try the other dishes, but I didn't see anyone raving about them. I would have given the place only one star, but the service was good, and the decor was interesting. I won't be back to this restaurant, which was recommended by a local friend. I would not recommend it to anyone else, but I'll give it a chance to improve. This is a very nice place. The service was fast. The food was excellent. My favorite was the Fried Wontons. We have been regulars at the China Express for many years. The food is very good and the service is quick and friendly. The food is always hot and fresh. We have never had a bad meal.

BigScience,yelp-307,"Two stars for outrageous price, 3 stars for quality of food. If you have had real and inexpensive Chinese food, it will be very hard for you to justify a trip here. This was my first time at this place with the excuse that we were in San Francisco. We all thought it would be just like any other Chinese restaurant so when I ordered one dish each we figured we'd make some room for dessert but unfortunately there wasn't enough space left on our plates! The waitress insisted we order extra something because she said it's a big deal if you don't eat your main course and her family is from China, never mind how much I wanted to resist ordering more food (I think I'm crazy). It's definitely not worth going back! I'm glad they offer vegetarian options; however, as somebody who has tried quite a few Asian restaurants I feel their offerings are lacking. Their steamed rice cakes might taste good, but I've tasted better ones elsewhere. Aside from that though everything else looked nice: noodles, vegetables and meat choices although I highly suggest eating these things quickly since they're served hot right off the grill! Everything about this restaurant is delightful. From the decorations to the friendly servers to the delicious Chinese cuisine. Definitely try all of their dishes - especially the stir fry shrimp veggies Great experience overall, service pleasant,food delicious and quick...would go again and recommend it to others"

I had the Mabo tofutasted just like the packaged kind I buy for 2. This was 15, plus 3 for steamed rice. Fiance got noodle soupnothing we haven't had before that was not only cheaper but better. Maybe if you are into PF Changs kind of Chinese food you should try this place. 50 for two people is cray cray. That would feed 4 people easily at a real Chinese restaurant! I realize this is Vegas and everything is expensive but for some reason, I have a harder time justifying paying this much for Chinese food because it is usually so cheap."

Tsinghua,yelp-308,I'm only giving this motel a 4 star instead of 5 because I can't imagine giving any motel 5 stars. I have stayed at this motel 4 times now. I love the location and the staff are friendly and helpful. I think they do need to clean the rooms a bit more but I have never had any issues.
Human,yelp-308,"I'm only giving this motel a 4 star instead of 5 because I can't imagine giving any motel 5 stars. I have stayed at this motel 4 times now. I stay at this motel because it is close to my favorite mega resort corner, but without the price tag of those mega resorts. From this motel I can easily access the Tropicana or Excalibur for some 5 black jack. Hooters next door has 3 black jack but I really don't like the Hooters Casino Hotel (see other review). I can also go to NYNY to get some Big Apple style eats. On top of all that, the nightclubs LAX and Studio 54 are within walking distance. Although, lately I've been finding myself at the new club in Hard Rock at least one night each stay. The Lobby: Is always surprisingly active and lively. Often times motel lobbies are dingy and quiet with the only sign of life being the person behind the counter - and even that can be a stretch. This motel is much different. There are usually 2-3 helpful staff members behind the counter, 1 attendant at the tourism desk and several guests in the lounge area using the internet. Check-in is always quick and easy. I always buy my internet at check-in. The best Wi-Fi deal in Vegas (only 324 hour period) The Rooms: There are essentially two options at this motel. The upgraded rooms and the standardclassic rooms. The upgraded rooms are actually very nice. You can start to forget you are in a cheap motel while watching your flat screen TV and walking on your faux wood floor. The bathrooms are very spacious with walk-in showers and clean tiling. The biggest downside to the upgraded rooms is the fact that they took space away from the bedroom portion to make room for the larger bathrooms. The beds are much closer together than I would have liked. If you are traveling alone or with one other person, this isn't much of an issue. I was in the room with three other people so it got a little cramped and was pretty disgusting by the time we left because we just didn't have enough space to put everything and keep it organized. There are no dressers if that is something you look for. The standardclassic rooms are what one would normally expect from a motel. Old, patterned comforters, dark carpeting, cramped bathrooms and outdated televisions. The beds are slightly more comfortable than the beds in the upgraded rooms (different style all together) and there is a lot more space in the bedroom area to spread out your stuff. Another advantage to the standard rooms is that you can ask for a room in the quieter building toward the back of the property. If you want space and a quieter atmosphere, I would suggest getting the standard room and requesting such. All of the upgraded rooms are in the building closest to the lobby. Dining: You can have food delivered to the motel easily, but why bother when there is a great 247 bakerydiner right next door called CoCo's. CoCo's is a chain restaurant but still maintains a diner feel and there are rarely any problems with food. In a 3 day period I typically go to CoCo's for brunch, a late dinner and a late night make me sober meal. Plus, if you want you can walk a few minutes more and go to Hooter's or any of the other mega resorts on the corner. There is also a convenience store adjacent to the lobby where you can grab quick snacks and drinks. Pool: I have no idea what the pool is like at this hotel. I never have the urge to use it. I tend to go over to Hooter's, Tropicana or Excalibur to use their pools. Tropicana is always open to the public (although you need to provide your own towel since they will demand a room number if you try to use theirs), Hooter's is open to the public, Excalibur is technically closed to the public (but everyone can easily get a towel before entering the pool area) but they only have a security guard glancing at room keys at peak entry hours. Plus, I'm pretty sure you could flash your grocery store savings card and it would work. I would suggest Excalibur for the most open air lounging space and I especially love the adults only pool area of Excalibur. Cleanliness: The rooms, lobby, bathrooms and parking lot have always been clean. I definitely leave the room much worse than I find it. This motel is definitely my go-to budget room in Vegas."

Eleuther-AI,yelp-309,"Having already visited the Home Hardware store in Morningside, I was expecting to find more of the same at their sister store in Portobello. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have a much larger range - over 100 bigger! And it is very well laid out and easy for you (and your trolley) too navigate through its two level layout with plenty storage space between them on both levels along each wall which makes getting around super-easy from whatever side or departmentaisle one may be starting off down as there are many 'island' bays throughout making navigation effortless I am pretty sure this place has everything under our roof anyway but if not then surely we can just go online order what would...

BigScience,yelp-309,"Having already visited the Home Hardware store in Morningside, I was expecting to find more of the same at their sister store in Portobello. I was pleasantly surprised to see that many sections were different from what they had there. For instance, my favorite section is right below this photo and it has better lighting than most stores here. They have lots of lights hanging up and smaller displays with big clear glass windows where you can easily view each item. It's great because if a light bulb's just not working - no worries it's visible! I also like how close everything is on shelves so no matter which aisle I'm standing on, I'll be able to get pretty much anything I've been looking for in one quick trip. Since they are part of Lowe's group (and yes, both companies do actually sell similar products), you'll definitely notice some differences when comparing items between these two locations. For example, Home Depot seems to carry more metal building supplies whereas Winco carries a lot more home decor such as candles, wall art etc. When we bought our house last year, we made sure to look around at all three major Home Depots before deciding to purchase ours. Even though Costco may seem like an odd choice, they offer very nice prices compared to other places including Target and Walmart. My husband even loves going through Costco's construction section since he enjoys buying things online but being able to try them out first makes him happier! If you're shopping locally, I've found that rarely will you ever pay less than 5 per gallon anywhere else. (That includes gas stations!) So save money by filling your tank while visiting one of these wonderful grocery stores! As always, feel free to share any questions or comments via email andor comment box below!! Thanks so much for reading!! This entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged Christmas Cards, DIY Paper Crafting, Holiday Cheer, Holidays, Papercrafting on December 21, 2013 by Angela Mossberg. I simply love fall crafting projects!!! And seeing decorations decorated everywhere gives me permission to pretend like autumn really exists...for now! This week marks the official start of Fall....in the northern hemisphere anyway. It feels strange spending summer days outside surrounded by flowers and warm weather yet fall comes almost too soon afterwards: gloomy skies, cooler temperatures and dark nights make a mess of fashion trends... But the good news is that erecting a barricade against cold weather doesn't mean giving up bright colors. After all, bolder hues might give us courage needed to face the season ahead!"
Human,yelp-309,"Having already visited the Home Hardware store in Morningside, I was expecting to find more of the same at their sister store in Portobello. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this store offers much of the same and more. Firstly, this place is very large. I just about managed to fit it all into the photo! It covers everything that you could possibly need for your home. There's paint, DIY equipment, plants, home accessories and furnishings and more besides. They also provide a delivery service, meaning that there's no need to trek out to a BQ or Homebase, when a place as big as this is probably just on your doorstep. Honestly, I was impressed with this place. It crams in a lot of stuff, and will succeed in dragging people away from the big chains to something more local. These people are definitely getting it right in my opinion."

LLAMA,yelp-310,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size. Also, their prices are outrageous. I didn't think this store was a thrift store at first. But, when I saw the prices, I saw that it was a thrift store, after all."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-310,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size. Also, their prices are a bit high compared to other second hand shops and I don't really like the fact that you can only find them on Sundays (no thanks). If anyone knows of any good places in Brooklyn please post!"
Human,yelp-310,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size. Also, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one."
Tsinghua,yelp-310,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size. Also, their prices are absurd. And most importantly, they aren't a store. They don't stock their own items. They rent space from another vendor. I've been to all of the thrift stores in my area, and I've never seen anything that's actually unique. The clothing may be in good shape, but they're mass produced items. I could buy an exact replica of the jean jacket in the picture above for 5 at the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army, as an organization, is a good one. I believe that if you can get a good deal, then thrifting is great. But there are better options out there. It's hard to compete with Walmart and Target when they both offer discounted clothing. Wednesday, March 27, 2010 You may have noticed the new button up shirt in my blog header. It's a Pixie cut version of my favorite flannel shirt, from the Etsy shop Recyclingisfun. I bought it from Recyclingisfun a couple of years ago. It's just the right length, not too long and not too short. It's comfortable and warm. The buttons are all a different color. I think it's so cute. So if you're looking for a cute flannel shirt that won't break the bank, I recommend you check out Recyclingisfun. Monday, March 25, 2010 I bought these on sale at Target a few weeks ago. They are my favorite kind of pants. The kind that you can't really see through, but still look like you are wearing pants. These have a great waist and aren't too tight or too loose. The best part? They're a bargain. This particular pair cost me 12. And it's not just any pair of pants. I bought these at the end of December, so it was at least a few months before I got the credit card bill. I can't believe that I'm already paying for these pants. But they are great! I wear them almost every day. Saturday, March 23, 2010 My friend asked me to be in her photoshoot for her blog, i-am-a-blankie. The pictures were taken on March 21st. She's got some really cute pictures. I like this one. It's funny, because it's a picture of me, but it doesn't look like me. Maybe I look better without the glasses? I'm not sure. But it's fun. And it's a good picture of the shoes I wore. They're boots. They're a little short, but they're great. I'm not sure why, but I like them. Wednesday, March 20, 2010 My friend and I just returned from a trip to Colorado. We had a great time, and I got some good pictures. I'll be posting those in the next few days. Today, I'm going to share a little about the trip. My friend and I took the train to Denver. I'm a little nervous about train travel. It's the only way to get to Denver, but I'm still a little afraid of train travel. We were there for 5 days. We stayed in a condo, which was great. It was very clean and the views were great. The condo had a washer and dryer, which was nice. We were able to wash our clothes before we left. Also, the condo had cable. And the condo had wifi. So we were able to get online, which was nice. We went to the ski resort, Estes Park. It was really fun. We had a great time. We did a lot of walking, which I'm sure helped me lose a few pounds. It was a little too cold to ski, but it was still fun. The snow was great. And the scenery was amazing. I'm glad I went. It was a great vacation. And I'm so glad I have friends who will take me to Colorado. I'm sure we'll go back some day. Sunday, March 17, 2010 I love my boots. They're not too high, but they're comfortable. They have a great heel, so they aren't too low. And they have the right kind of ankle support. I'm not sure how much they cost, but they are definitely a good price. The best part? They're comfortable. I wear them almost every day. The first time I wore them, I had to walk around the block."
BigScience,yelp-310,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size. Also, their prices are often higher because they have to buy the clothes in bulk from a vendor. Secondly, you can donate any item that has no resale value (or very little). Your clothing needs must be clean and free of stains before donation. When you donate your cloths at an outfitter's store, they'll send them off to an environmental organization or recycle center where they're properly disposed of - but when you're out on the streets of New York City, things don't always go as smoothly. The notorious fashion police pound NYC after dark with whistles, keys, trash bags, bags full of firecrackers, and anything else handy so you won't get caught carrying extra weight or wearing something deemed too revealing. Thus, make sure every piece you wear truly represents who you really are!"
OpenAI,yelp-310,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size. Also, their prices can sometimes be marked up too high compared to the value of the items. To help navigate these issues, there are a few tips to consider when shopping at a thrift store: 1. Look for sales: Many thrift stores have discounts on certain days of the week or during specific seasons. This can help you find great items at an even better price. 2. Check for quality: Before buying anything, thoroughly examine the item for any damages, stains, or wear and tear. It's important to also check the brand and material to ensure a good value for the price. 3. Be patient: Thrift stores can be overwhelming and time-consuming, but taking your time and searching for hidden gems can pay off in the end. 4. Consider alterations: If you find an item that's not the right size, consider getting it altered to fit you better. This can still be a cost-effective option compared to buying new. Overall, shopping at a thrift store can be a great way to save money, find unique items, and even support a good cause."

You can find cheaper clothing at other stores. For example, you can find a shirt for $10 at a thrift store, but you can find the same shirt for $5 at another store.

Tsinghua,yelp-311,"I come here about twice a month since I work a couple miles from here. The place is nice, and although the hostess looks as though she is irritated all the time, the food is excellent. The portions are HUGE and very generous. We usually get the halibut, which is a bit of a disappointment. We don't have the option of the halibut in any other form, and it is a bit too oily for our tastes. However, the salmon and the cod are delicious. They have a nice selection of salads and sandwiches, and they have a good selection of wine. Service is not too bad, but they do tend to be very busy, and you will have to wait a bit to be seated. It is nice to have a good place to eat out in the area, and we will be back soon.

I usually get the chicken parmigiana, and it's always been delicious. The pasta is cooked perfectly, and the chicken is juicy and flavorful. The sauce is also very good, and it's not too heavy. I also like the salad that comes with the meal. It's fresh and crisp, and it's a nice complement to the main course. The service at this restaurant is always top-notch. The servers are friendly and attentive, and they always make sure that you have everything you need. They're also very quick to bring your food out, and they always make sure that it's hot and fresh.

The place is nice, and although the hostess looks as though she is irritated all of her time (mostly because people are rude to her), she provides free coffee every morning if you have no money for it. There was one day that we were checking out after lunch when this hostess came in with a friend who had been drinking. It appeared they were feeling disheveled or something to do with not being able to get anything working on their laptops...but still insistent upon having more beverages... She picked up two glasses filled with what looked like ""beer"" and handed them over to the female companion. No sooner did my husband offer his own cup than she rolled her eyes at him and said he wouldn't need another glass - ""I'll fill your cup right now!"" Then she proceeded to pour some sort of black liquid into that poor man's drink. My husband casually finished off his beer - but then noticed how full she kept filling those cups until she offered ours back. My husband just sat there silently staring at me while sipping his homemade juice. You can see where things went wrong by comparing the shots below...

Ladies and gentlemen - welcome aboard DaVinci's Inferno For the next 21 days I'll be posting videos featuring ""surprising facts"" about Leonardo da Vinci. (Yes, I've done an extra verse...) A few weeks ago I posted some info about DaVinci using scissors and pencils instead of drawing directly onto paper. There has also been a bit of controversy surrounding these claims... DaVinci used pen and ink, pencil, charcoal, wax crayon, pastel, watercolor, oil paint, linocut, pastels knife, cotton swab mixed in water, etc.... Which means any painting made pre-digital may well contain layers built with different materials including metallic pigments and paints. Now, I'm confident my viewers will tell me that most paintings today use digital technology that allows artists greater freedom to experiment. The Digital Age began around 1978, introduced by Xerox, Kodak and others. Predictive analytics techniques allowed computers to predict outcomes based on statistics and configure systems appropriately so that production would maximize profitability. The earliest examples include automatic speech recognition programs such as IBM's Dictaphone and Apple's iMac. In 2006 Adobe Systems Inc., released Photoshop, enabling images ""to be easily edited online without leaving your computer."" Since the invention of photography there have been countless innovations in digital imaging technologies, ranging from single color cameras through TVs, VCRs, CD-ROMs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs to smartphones, tablets, drones, smartwatches, virtual reality headsets and other wearable devices,"

I myself am extremely picky on my salads, but I can eat theirs anytime. I always buy the little combo meals with come with 5 different selections (eg: Orange Chicken) and some type of sushi.... for 6.99! I will say the portion of your selection is rather on the small side, but the sushi roll seems just list any other. The taste is good, the food is fresh, all around this is one place you should try."

The place is nice, and although the hostess looks as though she is irritated all the time she will give you a warm welcome. The server was good and the food was decent. The salsa bar was nice, but they didn't have a lot of the hot sauce that you find at most places, and I couldn't find a lot of the mild sauce either. The margaritas were decent, but the prices were high. I think I paid 14 for a double, which I would expect to pay 8 for at most places. I would say it is an okay place, but there are a few other Mexican restaurants nearby that are better and the prices are much lower. Great service. Dinner was wonderful. We had the fajitas and the Mexican combo. Food was very good, but service was not. The waiter never checked on us and we had to flag him down for refills. Nice place. Went for a family dinner on a Wednesday night and was pleased with the service and food. Great Food and Great Margaritas! We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a chocolate cake with a candle. It was a nice touch. The food was good, and we had no problems with the service, and it was a nice atmosphere. I don't know that it would have been worth 50 for the three of us, but we had a 15 gift certificate. It was a bit pricey for a Mexican restaurant. My friend and I eat here once a month and have never been disappointed. My friend orders the 15 and I order the 17. Great food and service. The wait staff is friendly. I love this place! The food is great. We ate here on my birthday and they brought me a little cake, sang to me and everything. The service is always friendly and the food is outstanding. I love the jalapeno enchiladas! This is one of the most mediocre mexican restaurants in the area. Nothing special about it and you can do better. Great place to go for dinner. The food and service were wonderful.

We often eat there before we go to the movies! Love it. The food is always good. Food was good but service was terrible. We were ready to leave before they even asked if we wanted dessert. We went for lunch and the food was wonderful. My daughter loves the mini cheese quesadilla and my husband and I always order the nachos.

What do you think about having lettuce on top too instead of meat just like the sandwich or maybe an eggplant cheese sauce? If you'd rather have no lettuce then don't put any lettuce on bottom side (that's how most Thai restaurants serve their sandwiches). This sounds absolutely incredible!

Tsinghua,yelp-313,"We always stop here and bring back some of their delicious Macadia cookies and nuts home. This place is so inexpensive love it can wait to come back. There is also a gas station right next door. When I first came to Dominican Republic I was just looking for a place to get food and they had a couple of different types of hot dogs, I thought it was pretty cool because I never saw them before, and I also saw a stand that was selling ice cream, I never saw ice cream before in the DR and I had never tried it so I was excited to try it and it was amazing. I loved the combination of the hot dog and ice cream. My husband and I visited Puerto Plata this summer. We decided to stop at this bakery because it was super close to the airport. We were so happy we did. The breads and pastries were fresh and delicious. We were there for about an hour and a half and got to try all kinds of different pastries. We bought a couple of different types of croissants and some coconut bread. The coconut bread was my favorite. It was soft and moist. The croissants were a bit dry. I wish I had taken more pictures because it was really cute inside and the workers were very friendly. The only downfall was that it was really expensive."

I was right at 7 am only a few people were there but it's not that bad on Sundays even though most of us are struggling to get out bed after 2 or 3 hours sleep;) ""I don't know what your talking about."" She said in an annoyed tone as she put her dishes into dishwasher and washed them quickly so he could start cooking breakfasts before ten o'clock Sunday morning ""It makes sense we should be together because you're my son-in law.."" Asked Evelyn while walking back towards him with another glass full coffee saying this is gonna make me feel better.. He didn't bother answering instead just made sure his wife got some more helpings from their table by giving food choice suggestions then left when asked if everything okay? Whats wrong Mr McDuffy?...""He always loved playing games...""he had big plans too.........No matter how many times anyone asks Mcduff says things haven been easy since dad died........Says nothing has changed......And yes! The other day someone gave up trying asking why doesn' t any member come around anymore???? His reply....""Because nobody wants anything fking done without wanting something extra added first!"" Then became quiet again thinking would really love going shopping tomorrow!! But no chance will happen until somebody does..........Will close shop early Monday evening.....People have started coming here almost daily now - must remember where home base.""

We opted for the outdoor seating, the weather was pleasant with a slight breeze blowing. The ambience was very calm and peaceful, with soft background music playing. Our server was very attentive and friendly, she handed us the menu and guided us through their popular brunch dishes. We tried their signature dish, eggs benedict with a side of potatoes and grilled tomatoes. The eggs were poached to perfection, with a buttery, velvety hollandaise sauce. The potatoes were cooked to a crisp golden-brown and seasoned with herbs and spices, and the grilled tomatoes added a refreshing taste to the meal. For drinks, we ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and cold brew coffee. The orange juice was sweet and tangy, and the coffee had a bold, rich flavor. We also ordered a side of croissants, which were flaky and buttery. Overall, we had a delightful Sunday brunch experience, and we would definitely visit this place again."

I was right at 7 am only a handful of people were up and about, everyone else must be in bed still. Myself and my buddy sat at the bar and chatted and drank and waited for our food to come. The food was great, I had the egg and ham benedict and my buddy had a fish fry. He said it was the best he has had in years. I agree. We finished up with a nice view of the harbor and chatted some more before we went our separate ways. I can't say I recommend it but it was a nice change of pace and a great brunch. Definitely a local hang out. Saturday, February 14, 2011 I was on a fishing trip this weekend and as usual I took some pictures and my video camera, I am posting the pictures from my video camera and also a couple of my photos. The pictures were taken with my Sony camera and the video was shot with my Canon video camera. Sunday, February 8, 2011 This is a pretty cool place, you can actually catch fish in this 100 foot deep pool and it is heated to 80 degrees year round. It is a very cool place to go and fish. The water is clear and you can see the fish. The thing that is cool about this place is the fact that the water is heated, it is not cold like other places that I have been to. I have been to the new Saltwater Pools in Salt Lake City and I would rather go there. The Saltwater Pools are also heated and they have many types of fish and a lot of other fish. I think the Saltwater Pools are a better place to go fishing. I have been to several other places that have fishing pools and they all have some good fish but they do not have the same fish as the Saltwater Pools. The Saltwater Pools have a variety of fish and they are all very good fish. The Saltwater Pools are one of the best places to go fishing in the area. I have been to the other fishing pools and they do not have the same fish that the Saltwater Pools do. The Saltwater Pools have many types of fish, like; mullet, bluegill, sculpin, redbreast, trout, bass, pickerel, and many more. The Saltwater Pools are a good place to go fishing and it is a cool place to go. The Saltwater Pools are a cool place to go and it is a good place to go."
BigScience,yelp-314,"We went for sunday brunch, I like the fact they open at 7am, I figure everyone still sleeping nursing late night hangovers. I was right at 7 am only a few people were already there. Personally my favorite part of this place is that no one does their own dishes here. The food was good! The staff are very friendly and quick to answer any questions you may have- also very helpful in finding out which places are nearby if you're planning on trying something new or just need directions. Overall I'm not disappointed with the service! My boyfriend I visited True Food yesterday as it had been recommended by many friends as having some great Italian cuisine - we liked our experience so much we ordered for take away today. Our dining area looked clean, well stocked, comfortable relaxing - all elements required for an enjoyable meal. Our waitress came over to enquire about our order asked how long we'd waited (we arrived promptly) she then proceeded to put salad on top of our seafood pasta dish saying 'it won't be ready until later' we politely told her we wanted it earlier but didn't want additional charge made for being patient enough to book ahead of time despite the delay. She said they'd bring it to us however after waiting a while without seeing anything more than two bites from the entire platter initially presented to us she finally brought some breadsticks alongside. This took up most of what could've been delicious flavoursome ingredients. In general i found the restaurant to be inconsistant with its description on yelp; although it's clearly geared towards those wanting authentic italian fare, there's little else thats specifically described besides ""food"" - these days that's really important because half the people visiting restaurants don't know what they're looking for in terms of flavour since they've never experienced eating elsewhere apart from their home cooking - unfortunately i wasn't able to try everything (though hopefully they'll make me feel welcome again soon!)"

This is a well priced breakfast spot, so if you don't have a ton of cash, this is your spot. I ordered the shrimp and grits which was quite good, not the best I have ever had but good enough to order again. My wife ordered an omelette which was huge and had a ton of stuff in it. She also ordered a homemade waffle. The waffle was very thick, they use a waffle iron made of cast iron and the waffle comes out with a slightly crispy outer edge. The waffle was very good. The service was ok, not fantastic but pretty good. The place is very large so it is great for a big group. I would definitely go back for more sunday brunch. We have been here twice now and both times it was very good. It is a nice place to have breakfast or lunch. The staff is very friendly and fast.

I was right at 7 am only a handful of us old folks in line... The buffet was very limited and not many items. For about 25 bucks a head you should get more. The hot foods were mostly breakfast items what happend to the lunch part of brunch. Very sad. Everthing was fresh as it should be since we were their early. Still can't believe a beautiful casino,' upscale would have a brunch that was so simple. Spend a few more bucks and go to wynn, or bellagio. Service was fine."

And it always tasted the same until last Sunday, when it was different. After a few bites I realized what I ordered isn't what I got. So I handed it off to the manager looking dude and told him I'd prefer to get what I actually ordered. His response was to bring it back to my table and try to convince me that what I had was what I actually ordered. Bye bye, Chandler Rumbi, I won't be back.

Have gone to this place for many years now, but have never had great experiences with it. I went here two weeks ago after having heard of people complaining about their food being too fatty due to being made from lamb calf oil which was used not long before they switched over to olive oil....More If you are looking for Indian cuisine you should go somewhere else. This is definitely NOT India at all. I know what you're thinking ""what's that got to do with food?"" The answer is: pretty much everything! Our first meal consisted of Paneer Tikka Masala. Not once did we get the tikka masala. We were also given veggies without knowing them so that they would taste better. When our second dish came out- our favourite dish Chicken Tikki- we found that every time some other dishes shared with us tasted as if we had just eaten them ourselves. Then when another dish arrived and everyone gave up because they couldnt eat any more - my husband asked for his third piece of chicken tikki and discovered it has no meat on top!. My mother-in-law then requested her fourth portion saying she didn't like the sauce and thought its better than rice. Its obvious theres something wrong here; the only reasonable explanation i can come up with is ""they use processed eggs to make the batter!?."" Horrible experience overall. We will NEVER return! ..nope, we're sorry. We've changed suppliers quite recently it's become apparent that restrictions don't allow us to cater to your desires...we hope you'll consider using one of the alternatives suggested above or perhaps even stick around SOHO... What an absolute joke!! sitting down 6 adults to order 2 chicken wings each. They took forever getting through to me ran into a waitress who treated us meanly insisting that payment be transferred into the cash register instead of giving change back. Offered choice between paying curiusely enough or takeout. Told her I cant accept anything CRAZY in public. She said why dont you ""go somewhere private""??? I politely told her I'm sick of ALL these girls offering inappropriate sexual advances at fastfood restaurants, especially when you've ordered nothing yet!!! No one seemed capable taking responsibility for anyone except themselves during the entire course of the matter. And worst offending thing: after receiving my bill and seeing how expensive it was I tried to explain to one of the staff members that maybe they'd seen ppl eating free appetizers elsewhere. After hearing NO! THE ONLY THING YOU GET BACK FOR YOUR COSTUME IS ANOTHER FREE APPETIZER! WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY!!! How dare ANY restaurant with such gross attitude treat you so horribly? You may want to ask yourself where the heck does pork ribs end and beef brisket begin?! You really need to work on your presentation skills.

LLAMA,yelp-315,"I've been to Rumbi probably a few dozen times. Worked near the (now closed) Rumbi on Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale and ate there several times. Have gone to this Rumbi (SanTan) a few times with my wife, once before our daughter was born and once after our daughter was born. And every time I've come, I've tried something different. To be honest, I've been impressed every time. I started off with a small Zebra mug. I ordered a chocolate chip milkshake, because they had no chocolate malt. Still, it was a delicious milkshake and well-done. I recommend it. For an appetizer, I had the garlic bread. It was nice and crispy, but still soft and it tasted great with the cheese. My only problem was it wasn't quite enough cheese and the toppings were a little heavy. But still, it was quite good and very enjoyable. My wife had the chicken enchilada platter. There were several chicken enchiladas, guacamole, sour cream, rice and beans. My wife liked it and the food was good. She even offered to let me try it, but I decided not to. She did leave a little bit, and I tried that. It was good and I would recommend it. For my entree, I had the Huli Huli Chicken. This is a grilled chicken breast marinated in a Hawaiian style sauce. It's served with pineapple, rice and steamed veggies. I had the rice replaced with fries. It was a very nice meal and one I recommend. The chicken was a little tough, but otherwise it was very good. My daughter had the Kids Meal. She had fried chicken, fries and a small salad. She didn't eat the salad, but she did enjoy the fries and chicken. I think she liked the chicken a bit more, but she ate all the fries and chicken that was there. My wife had a coke. I had an iced tea. She liked her drink. I liked my drink. I had the Chocolate Hula Pie. It was chocolate mousse with coconut, pineapple and macadamia nuts. It was served on a graham cracker crust. It was delicious. It was very tasty and I would recommend it. My daughter had the Frosty Fun. It was a malt with whipped cream, cherry and chocolate syrup. She didn't eat any of the cherry or chocolate, but she did eat the whipped cream and malt. She liked it, and I'd recommend it. The service was very good. The waiter was very good and we were very pleased. They brought out our meals quickly and were very attentive to our needs. Overall, the food was very good and I would recommend this restaurant."

Shopping at this mall was the worst experience ever, I gave up after walking in and wasting 5 minutes getting there. At first they had nice looking things (like shoes) but as soon as you leave the front of the store everything has great prices that are way below what should be expected. Even though I've been to many malls before, this one really sucks when compared with others. The only reason why we decided to stop by this mall today was because my husband is from Indiana so he wanted to check out something unique there! We were expecting nice clothes or maybe an electronics shop... nope!!! All stores right now sell anything on sale and in reduced price. There isn't much variety either - just stuffed bags of HM clothing, JC Penny, etc.. Not having more than 2 other options does bother me since I'm always going into Target, Walmart, etc.. So sad to see how badly these shops feel about their business; the owners apparently don't think it's worth investing any money or effort, so they're taking advantage and selling products like crap every day! It feels depressing watching sacks full of unsold JCPenney dresses sitting empty along side new styles each week! A friend told us about Mall Of America which is very near our house and she said it's pretty cool!! She actually bought her wedding gowns there!! We went last weekend to purchase jeans.....all the men's style jeans were 25-30 dollars cheaper then anywhere else around town....and they made sure we got them while they still sold......so i don't know if that's ""good will"" discount or not but whatever..... i would go thru walmart target too because those are the best places to get quality items at bargain basement prices My wife usually gets hooked up with some bargains at BJs, Harbor Freight and Lowes. My favorite is the MRO section located behind the hotel convention center. Great story....maybe another person experienced similar thing? If yes, please share with other readers...

Tsinghua,yelp-317,"Tiffany did make a change and this time the service was great! I had a very good memory so bought another pair of rings after returned the first pair. Very nice, great service and no hassles at all. Again I am very happy with the ring. The customer service I received was the best! The ring is beautiful, and I am so happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a beautiful ring. Great customer service and great service! This ring is absolutely beautiful! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it is quite large. I received it in the mail yesterday and I will be wearing it on my engagement ring finger."

LLAMA,yelp-318,"Melt, located on the Northwest corner of N 5th E Garfield is in the middle of a super hipster artsy neighborhood. There is art by local artists hanging on the walls and a large community table for those that want to meet new people. The cafe is small with a lot of windows for a bright and warm atmosphere. It is an open concept with the kitchen and prep areas in full view of the customers. This is an independent cafe that is doing it's own thing and has found success. The cafe is owned by two women, Wendy and Kristine, who met while working in the coffee industry. I ordered a large Chai Tea and a chocolate covered coconut macaroon. I was pleased to see that they did not have any ""double blend"" or ""secret"" ingredient chai teas. It was just chai tea, milk, and ice. I was also happy to see that they used Oregon Chai. I am sure that the other ingredients are high quality, as well, but I was only concerned with the chai tea. I was also happy to see that they used Oregon Chai. I am sure that the other ingredients are high quality, as well, but I was only concerned with the chai tea. I like Oregon Chai. It has a very distinct flavor that I like. It is spicy and sweet, but doesn't have as many different spices as some other chai teas. I prefer the Oregon Chai Cafes original blend over their concentrate, and the Melt chai was delicious. The macaroon was a delicious chocolate treat. It was a bit dry, but the dryness was overpowered by the coconut and chocolate flavors. It was almost chewy, but not too chewy. It was also a bit crumbly. All in all, it was a yummy treat to have with my chai tea. The cafe also had a large menu of bagel sandwiches, salads, and a whole case of fresh pastries and macaroons. I was in a rush and didn't get to try any of the other foods, but I am sure they are as tasty as my chai and macaroon. Melt is a great place to meet up with friends, or to grab a quick bite to eat. They also have free Wifi, so it is a great place to take your laptop and catch up on some work. Melt is a great place to meet up with friends, or to grab a quick bite to eat."
Human,yelp-318,"Melt, located on the Northwest corner of N 5th E Garfield is in the middle of a super hipster artsy neighborhood. There is art by local artists hanging on the walls inside and more local artists' work spray painted on the outside of neighborhood buildings. No, I'm not suggesting that this is a grungy graffiti bombed neighborhood, it's definitely underground hipster. It is located inside an old house, and you're greeted out front by a bright retro neon sign. It is just too cute and very welcoming. There is an area to sit and enjoy your tasty treats outside the building, but I was grabbing mine to go on my way out of town. Melt sells a variety of clever flavors of locally produced ice cream, though the way it is displayed in the cases reminds one of gelato. Melt gives free tastes!!!! I decided to try the cucumber as it sounded like such a unique flavor. I could feel the texture of fresh cucumber on my tongue and the taste was lifht and fresh. I also tasted the fried ice cream flavor which had a nice war cinnamon flavor to it. I finally settle on ordering the super farm chocolate which tastes like a lot like Nutella and looks like a rose in a Chinese takeout box with a fortune cookie on top. Melt sells super delicious ice cream, but with ever purchase you also get a little taste of the indy arts district, free of charge. And who could possible put a price tag on that. The ice cream is pricey, but totally worth the expense."
PaLM,yelp-318,"Melt, located on the Northwest corner of N 5th E Garfield is in the middle of a super hipster artsy neighborhood. There is art by local artists hanging on the walls. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They have a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and soups. The sandwiches are all made with fresh ingredients and are very tasty. The salads are also very fresh and flavorful. The soups are hearty and filling. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Overall, Melt is a great place to go for a casual meal. Here are some specific examples of the food:  The Cuban sandwich is made with ham, pork, Swiss cheese, mustard, and pickles on toasted Cuban bread. It is very flavorful and filling.  The grilled cheese sandwich is made with two slices of sourdough bread, American cheese, and butter. It is simple but delicious.  The tomato soup is made with fresh tomatoes, basil, and garlic. It is very flavorful and hearty.  The chicken salad sandwich is made with grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, and cucumber on a toasted bun. It is light and refreshing. Here are some specific examples of the art:  There is a painting of a woman in a red dress by a local artist.  There is a sculpture of a dog made out of metal.  There is a print of a cityscape by a famous artist. Overall, Melt is a great place to go for a casual meal. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxed.

BigScience,yelp-318,"Melt, located on the Northwest corner of N 5th E Garfield is in the middle of a super hipster artsy neighborhood. There is art by local artists hanging on the walls and there are at least 6 murals covering this space! The rooftop area has amazing views over NYC. This place is so hot right now that I almost had to have my friend David show me before he could get outta there! He said it was like being backstage for Coachella or something where everyone goes because they want to be seen with good food AND great drinks!! It's literally hard not to feel like you've been transported somewhere else while you're here... but from outside looking in that's pretty much how you would describe Melt. The decor inside makes us think we're in some sort of fairytale castle! A giant fountain flows across the ceiling and couples tend their outdoor tables as if it's an afternoon tea party. We were able to take pictures underneath all these cool sculptures which look just like old toys! They really made up our time waiting to order drinksfoodetc. We ordered 2 cocktails each (and one beer) and off came the delicious American Sour Cream Onion Cocktail: And then finally we tried both of the pizzas! Our favorites might actually be different though - I love the peppers mozzarella pizza better than the pepperoni pizza. But share your opinions below! I was given the opportunity to try these two products!! From the first product I've always loved applying liquid lip colors and I'm sure those who know me personally will agree that I don't normally go with matte finishes too often unless I absolutely fall head-over-heels in love with them. So when these satin muted reds showed up I thought what do I need anymore? Oh well this one's yours"

Human,yelp-320,"Monte Carlo, why did I choose to stay here? Must be that it is located right in the middle of the strip, next to Aria and the City Center. This used to be my wife's favorite hotel in Las Vegas. Don't ask me why because I honestly don't know. With many newer and older but better establishments on the strip, there's really no reason to choose Monte Carlo unless you already knew that... the POOL has a lazy river! It's not as long as the ones you might find at MGM, but it is sufficient enough to relax and take a moment away from the busy casino noise. You can also rental a tube as floating device at the service counter. But really, that's all the highlights of this hotel, unless you enjoy... CHEAP FOOD COURT adjacent to the main elevators. If I remember correctly, they have Starbucks, McDonald's, Manchu Wok, Rubio's, and Subway. These are some of the choices that you might not find in other hotels on the strip. Of course, if you want to drop a few hundred dollars, you can do at the casino, unless you knew to... go to ANDRE'S, the fine dinning restaurant of Monte Carlo. I have not personally tried it, but according to fellow yelpers, it's a traditional french restaurant that's hidden away inside the casino. When food coma hits, you might just want to passed out anywhere on the casino floor, unless you already have a... ROOM at the Monte Carlo, which is nothing spectacular, nothing more a than regular hotel room with regular beds, chairs, and bathroom. Very regular, but adequate for your nap until the thin walls allow you to hear everything your neighbors do. That's when you ask yourself, why did I choose... Monte Carlo. Must be its centralized location on the strip."
BigScience,yelp-320,"Monte Carlo, why did I choose to stay here? Must be that it is located right in the middle of the strip, next to Aria and the City Center.

Allow Minnie Mouse or Goofy's Poolside Party complimentary beach towels during your time there if they take up residence on pool deck because this resort will make any child happy!! You can expect wonderful customer service from all associates working within our guest rooms - especially since we are pet friendly; Don't worry about what pets do...we love them too!!! The staff was amazing when my dog went into labor shortly after arriving taking care he needed until birth without hesitation helping us find an emergency vet immediately so she could have her baby safely delivered elsewhere before checking back later once things had settled down again thank goodness no complications were involved but wanted me informed quickly nonetheless under stressful circumstancesbeen very impressed by their concern towards each other......would definitely recommend staying anywhere near Myrtle Beach whether traveling alone solo parenting families large groups pooch lovers....big Tigger fan myself: Great location along highway 17 North close enough toward route 501 early exit coming cross fwy 26 making travel easy thru Bristol NC Charlotte SC Huntersville Winston Salem Morgantown WV Burlington VA Williamsburg Virginia.....anyhow hope everyone enjoys reading these blogs throughout 2010..don 't miss seeing Mickey annually many times over yearround now living closer than ever surrounding metro Atlanta areas; Cheers Patti"

LLAMA,yelp-320,"Monte Carlo, why did I choose to stay here? Must be that it is located right in the middle of the strip, next to Aria and the City Center. This is the hotel that has the blackjack dealers that wear the lingerie like uniforms, the one that has the radio show 247, and the one that was the first to have the pool party. I choose Monte Carlo because of the location, because I wanted to be in the center of the strip, so I can walk to any hotel from there. I stayed in Monte Carlo for two nights. The second night I got upgraded to a nicer room, with a view of the strip. I was happy about that. The room was smaller than the one I had for the first night, but it was a lot better. It was a Deluxe Room, with a Queen bed and a sofa bed. My room was located on the 27th floor, near the elevators. The room was clean, and they changed the towels everyday. The bathroom was small, but it had everything I needed. The service was good. I didn't ask for anything. I checked in online, so I didn't have to wait in line at the front desk. I asked for a late check-out, but they didn't honor it. That was a problem because when I came back to the hotel, at 1pm, the room was already cleaned. They didn't change my sheets, but they changed the towels. The security people were nice too, they even helped me with the bags. The housekeeping people were nice, and they even brought me extra towels and toilet paper, without me having to ask. I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but I had some drinks at the casino. They have a nice bar there, close to the sports book. They have a variety of cocktails. The food in the casino looked good too. Monte Carlo has a small casino, a pool, a bar, and a night club. The casino has many slots and table games. I played blackjack there. They didn't have many 5 tables, so I played 10 tables. They also have a small sports book. Monte Carlo has a small pool, but they have a big pool party too. I didn't go to the pool party because I was too busy going to night clubs. They have a small pool, but it is nice and it is heated. The hotel also has a night club, Blush, and a bar. I didn't go to the night club, but I went to the bar. I met a couple of girls there, and they were nice. I didn't hook up with any of them, but I had a good time talking to them. Monte Carlo is a nice hotel, especially for being on the strip. I enjoyed my stay there. I liked the upgraded room, and the location. I would stay there again."
Human,yelp-321,"We were attempting to purchase a home in the Vegas area and in this tight market, needed everything to go smoothly in financing in order to not have our deal fall through. Not only did our loan officer not make the process smooth, he overlooked simple qualifications that needlessly ate time. We had to change loan types in between because he did not look at the debt on our credit report correctly and so we had to restart the whole process which burned a week. While the credits markets were rocky over the couple of weeks we were obtaining this loan (which we could have avoided had simple conditions not been overlooked earlier) our officer used it to change between rates as high as 4.5 to 3.75 back to 4 with added costs that were not disclosed earlier. Not only do I watch markets anyways, a week with a fluctuation like the one described above would be catastrophic in the economy. We were in constant need to do financial gymnastics to pay down loans and meet conditions which is not the fault of WJ Bradley completely (mortgage laws are crazy now), but the lack of warning and preparation was, and again, could have been avoided had our officer been more attentive. We did not get low costs or good rates with WJ Bradley, nor did we receive competent service to justify the higher costs."

LLAMA,yelp-321,"We were attempting to purchase a home in the Vegas area and in this tight market, needed everything to go smoothly in financing in order to not have our deal fall apart. After several months of dealing with a local bank and mortgage company, we were still unable to get to closing. We needed a home loan in 4 weeks, with very little down payment. We did not have the time to wait on the local companies who wanted to make us jump through hoops to qualify for a loan. I was contacted by a representative of USA Mortgage who told me they could have us qualified in 10 days or less, with less than 5 down. This sounded too good to be true but I decided to try it since we were running out of options. After a phone interview, I was pre-qualified in minutes, and in 10 days had a letter of commitment on the property. We were able to close on the property in 22 days. We had originally planned on a 30 year loan, but USA Mortgage got us a 15 year loan at a lower interest rate, which will save us a substantial amount of money in the long run. USA Mortgage went above and beyond the call of duty, working with us long after normal business hours to complete the loan. I would recommend this company to anyone and will use them in the future for any of my mortgage needs. Thanks, USA Mortgage, for making our dreams of owning a home in Vegas come true."

BigScience,yelp-321,"We were attempting to purchase a home in the Vegas area and in this tight market, needed everything to go smoothly in financing in order to not have our deal fell through. We decided that we would just take on the entire project ourselves rather than hire a realtor or an agent. In my opinion, if you are trying to sell your house fast, it is best NOT to hire a real estate agent. The only thing they do well is photographing houses for showings so there's no communication between buyers and seller other than photos. They generally want their commission but will bill thousands of dollars up front from you. There really isn't much else to them except showing pictures online! My husband worked at one local bank (I can't remember which) as a mortgage professional and was able to get us approved very quickly because he was already working with the lender!!

I felt very satisfied and happy. I can see how eating out can make you feel so good. I hope you had a wonderful day! xo The first time I went to Bob's Red Mill it was the end of January. It was my first time at a ""real"" store and I was overwhelmed with the choices. After a few minutes of Googling, I realized that I could make most of the things I wanted to buy at home. And I have! Over the past 4 months I have made my own vegan mayonnaise, vinaigrettes, mustard, yogurt, soy sauce, lemon curd, and I just made my first batch of maple syrup. I also made my first batch of almond milk last week. It is the first time I have ever made anything from scratch. I made my first batch of amaranth flour last week and am trying to learn how to make my own whole grain flours. I bought 4 bags of amaranth flour. I had never heard of it before and I didn't know what it was or what it was used for. I figured it was a flour that is used for baking, but it was so expensive that I didn't want to buy it unless I knew I was going to make a lot of baked goods with it. I am really excited to try it! I have also learned how to make my own bread from scratch. I used this recipe from In Defense of Food to make a batch of whole wheat bread. It was a really good bread! I am looking forward to making more. I am also learning how to make my own nut butters. I made almond butter and cashew butter last week. They turned out really well. I am going to make some more soon. I bought a little jar of coconut oil this week. I had never used it before and I am really looking forward to trying it out. I have been experimenting with cooking lately. I bought a little 2 quart casserole dish this week and I have been making a lot of casseroles. I have made the brown rice casserole, vegetable casserole, and the chicken enchilada casserole. I am really looking forward to trying some new recipes. I am still working on my own meal plan. I am trying to stick to a 2000 calorie plan. I am trying to stick to the plan and am not really having any problems with it. I am just really not looking forward to working on it every night.

OpenAI,yelp-322,"chicken fried steak, biscuits, hash..... all in an authentic diner setting. Perfect. It sounds like you're looking for a recommendation for an authentic diner experience that serves chicken-fried steak, biscuits, and hash! I would recommend checking out your local area for any diners or mom-and-pop restaurants that serve traditional American breakfast and brunch fare. You could start by searching online or asking for recommendations from friends, family, or neighbors. If you're looking for a chain restaurant, Cracker Barrel is a popular choice that is known for its Southern-style comfort food and rustic decor that mimics an old-fashioned general store. They serve chicken-fried steak, biscuits, and hash, among other classic dishes. I hope this helps you find the perfect diner experience!"
BigScience,yelp-322,"chicken fried steak, biscuits, hash..... all in an authentic diner setting. Perfect. The atmosphere was wonderful and the service wonderful! We will return again! Amazing food!!! Very large portions for our hungry family of 4 adults who went on a Saturday night. There is also great American coffee from their hot chocolate to their iced coffees. This place has fantastic fresh New York style sandwiches with so much choice that it can be difficult to pick just one. I have been here twice now with my 5 year old son (and myself) and always enjoy every bite. They even make a superb milkshake which we both love as well. Put simply this is a must visit place when you are passing through Plymouth. (more...) The best hamburger I've ever had!! My whole family loves it... it's awesome.

Human,yelp-323,"What is there to love about Toby Keith's Bar Grill? Not a whole lot. My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's who 1. Doesn't take reservations and 2. Wanted us to wait 2 hours to eat. Ha ha! No thanks Guy. And BTW - no reservations? Come on. First TK's has a fun atmosphere, but looks like a normal'ol bar and grill. The walls are decorated with Toby Keith.... things, and all the girls wear panties and chaps. Ass in your face every time your server leaves your table. Speaking of service, it could be improved. After we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes to put our order in, luckily, since we all had sufficient time we all knew what we wanted to eat and drink. Onward to the food - steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and made me excited. But when were placed in front of me were a let down. The beef was haphazardly cut and chunky, not strips. Plus the meat was not seasoned in anyway and it looked just WRONG to me. Fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I picked corn - half of them were not steamed enough and had hard edges. They brought them out in a tortilla holder with NO LID. What the heck? No wonder it did not steam all the way. Dear manager of TK's: put lids on your tortilla holders and customers will get tortillas that are soft! My fajitas also came with: rice (OK), refried beans (OK), salsa (not spicy at all), guac (OK), and sour scream (OK). Overall what could be a great dish, only mediocre. Next - I Love This Bar BBQ Sandwich - my mother requested no sides for her sandwich, but they brought her fries anyway. She said the BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce. Chicken Fried Steak - My brother had this and said it was so-so, not a REAL chicken fried steak in my family's opinion because it didn't appear to be pan-fried, which is the honest way to make a chicken fried steak - not deep frying it with a lot of breading. Speaking of breading... My husband's fish and chips were mostly breading which he peeled off so he could actually eat the fish. Lastly, the shrimp appetizer which my father ordered for his meal came with a HUGE amount of deep fried little shrimp. There had to have been 20 and it came with a tasty, creamy cajun-flavored dipping sauce. I really liked the shrimp. Overall - I feel as though there could be a lot of improvement. I like Toby Keith. I like the idea of the restaurant - I really like all the country music they were playing, but the food was a huge downer."

My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's, and we were all pretty disappointed. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was even worse. The atmosphere was pretty lively, but it was also very loud. We had a hard time hearing each other talk, and the music was so loud that it was hard to even enjoy our meal. The food was pretty disappointing. We ordered the chicken fried steak, the fish and chips, and the mac and cheese. The chicken fried steak was dry and overcooked, the fish and chips were soggy, and the mac and cheese was bland. The service was even worse than the food. We waited over an hour for our food to come out, and when it finally did, it was wrong. We had to send it back, and it took another 30 minutes for us to get our correct order. The only positive thing I can say about Toby Keith's Bar Grill is that the drinks were pretty good. We had a few margaritas and they were delicious. Overall, I would not recommend Toby Keith's Bar Grill to anyone. There are much better restaurants in the area that offer better food and service. Here are some specific examples of what went wrong during our experience at Toby Keith's Bar Grill:  The chicken fried steak was dry and overcooked.  The fish and chips were soggy.

We didn't exactly want him going home hungry after such hard work though... So anyway this place was really bad foodby some standards but nearly non existent by others; which might be why it has become somewhat popular amongst local college kids.. Especially since their drinks are cheap compared ot other places like TGI Fridays or Red Robin where they charge 7 per drink tip while here its only around 3 bucks plus tax making them more affordable especially when your take into consideration what kind beer prices have been lately.... Now saying these things doesn't make me anti American nor does believing everything should remain old school Japanese serve good sushi along side freshly cooked lobster tail makes us traitors...

My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's , which we were unable to get in on. However, after our first bite of meatless tacos (which did not disappoint!), my husband was convinced that he would be back if they reestablished their full menu. The restaurant exists largely thanks to the generosity of fans who are willing to drive up from far and wide just so they can say hello to one of country music's biggest stars. (Those people should have received free parking!) But despite his fame, TKB hasn't lived up to its name - or at least, not yet. The food here comes out cold; it doesn't take long for your steak to fall apart all over itself.

Tsinghua,yelp-323,"What is there to love about Toby Keith's Bar Grill? Not a whole lot. My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's location, but I can't say we enjoyed it. I like Toby Keith. I think he's a fine singer and songwriter, and his ""Toby Keith's Greatest Hits"" compilation is one of my favorites. I love his material. But I can't stand his marketing strategy. I'm sure he makes a lot of money from the people who listen to his music, but I feel like he's milking it. And the things that Toby Keith says are so stupid. It's not that he's a jerk, but he just has a ""mean streak"" about him that's inescapable. His songs are often very vulgar, and his restaurants have ""tough"" names like TK's Bar and Grill. If you're a guy who likes the drink, TK's is probably not the place for you. We sat at a table and I tried to listen to Toby Keith, but he just can't sing. The first song he sang was ""I'm a Drinkin' Man."" He just couldn't sing the words. He'd make up his own lyrics and sing them. When he couldn't remember the words, he just sang the word ""fool."" It was horrible. He also did a version of ""Cruise Control,"" which I don't think I've ever heard before. It was a terrible version. I would never pay 22.99 to listen to Toby Keith's Greatest Hits. It's a joke. It's the worst kind of 1990s throwback, when everything was the most raunchy, the most misogynistic, and the most crude. I remember going to a bar in the '90s that had a sign that said ""Topless"" over the bathroom. There was nothing topless about it. It was just a sign that said ""topless."" You couldn't go to that bar unless you wanted to see topless women. I think Toby Keith's Greatest Hits is the same. It's not a 1990s throwback. It's just a collection of songs that are totally inappropriate for the environment. When I listen to it, I just think, ""This is a dumb idea. Why would I want to listen to this?"" I can't say I enjoyed TK's. I had a turkey burger, which was bland and dry. I had a salad, which was delicious. I had a drink, which was the most expensive drink I've ever had. It was 12.99, and I've never had a drink that expensive before. I had the beer pong table. I don't know what it's like to play beer pong, but it's something I would like to play. I tried to take a picture of it, but the restaurant was dark and the light didn't work. I didn't try the other bar. I just wanted to see if TK's was like the other Toby Keith's restaurants, but it wasn't. It was just like TK's. There were a few pictures of TK in the bathroom. I'm sure they were there to attract customers. The bathroom was pretty bad. There was a picture of Toby Keith on the wall. There were a couple of Toby Keith's mugs. There were a few Toby Keith's hats. There was a Toby Keith's video game. I'm sure that was all there to attract customers. I'm not sure I could ever go back to Toby Keith's. I can't stand the idea of going to a place where I have to listen to Toby Keith. I'm sure there are lots of people who love Toby Keith. They probably went to Toby Keith's because they wanted to hear him sing, and because they wanted to go to a Toby Keith's. I just don't think I'm one of those people. I think I'd rather have dinner at, say, Macaroni Grill. I think I'd rather have dinner at White Castle. I think I'd rather have dinner at TK's Bar and Grill. It was okay. I'm sure it was a lot cheaper than it would have been if I had gone to Toby Keith's. But I'm not sure I could ever go back to Toby Keith's. Thursday, September 16, 2007 I'm sorry to say that this is my last blog post. I just don't have much to say anymore. I've said everything I wanted to say. I've already posted pictures of the whole room."

TK's was a great alternative. For those of you who have never been to TK's, it is a country music themed bar and restaurant. It is owned by country music star Toby Keith. The decor was not my favorite. The whole restaurant had a brown theme, which I guess is great if you are a fan of country music. I am not so much a fan of the color brown. I am a fan of Toby Keith though. He is a great singer. My favorite song of his is ""I love this bar."" We were given a buzzer, which is always a great way to give people an idea of when their food will be ready. There were tons of TV's all over the restaurant. I think this was a great way to entertain the guests. There were TV's in the ceiling, on the wall, in the bar area, etc. If you enjoy sports, you would have enjoyed TK's. My family and I ordered the following: 12 rack of ribs, 12 rack of ribs with pulled pork, and the BBQ chicken. I really enjoyed the 12 rack of ribs. The sauce was perfect. It had the perfect amount of spice and sweetness to it. The ribs were cooked perfectly and were very tender. I would recommend getting the ribs. They are really good. The BBQ chicken was not as good as the ribs. It was very dry, and the chicken was not very tender. My family did not enjoy the pulled pork. They thought that the pork was dry and tough. I thought the BBQ sauce was a little too sweet, but I liked the spice that the pork had. Overall, we did not enjoy TK's. The food was not very good, and the service was just mediocre.

There was no one there but our table when we went, I believe that is because they are located in a business district It's possible that the lack of customers was due to the restaurant being located in a business district, where foot traffic might be lighter outside of regular business hours. However, it's worth considering other possible factors as well, such as lack of advertising, competition from other nearby restaurants, or issues with the restaurant's menu or service. Regardless, it's great that you were able to enjoy your meal, and you could consider leaving a review or recommending the restaurant to others to help spread the word."

I've tried other local Thai restaurants and none of them can compare. The food was great! They were even able to make the curry less spicy. Our favorite Thai food around here. Fast delivery too. Delicious food! Great, quick service! Will definitely order from them again! My 2 favorite thai dishes are pad thai and chicken pineapple fried rice. I've ordered from here 3 times now and every time I've been thrilled with my order. I highly recommend this restaurant and will continue to order from here. Food is always hot and fresh, and the food is amazing! The food was delicious and ready on time. Delivery was fast. I have ordered from here a few times and have been very pleased each time. Food was good. Chicken was moist and flavorful. I would definitely order again."

BigScience,yelp-326,"Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful, especially the Carolina Turkey Club. The portions are huge and they also have a line of small sandwiches on their menu that can be ordered for take out or delivery. I took my girls here yesterday to get some lunch after buying them breakfast we loved it! We had BLT's which were really good; then I went with chicken enchiladas w cheese dipping sauce...very tasty as well!!! Then dessert was choco mousse and hot fudge sundae (this is actually my favorite!) My husband found this place while he was looking for food near his office. He saw an ad in our local newspaper and just drove by so he could try it. Pretty sure he's never been disappointed before! This restaurant has excellent service combined with reasonable prices. They offer great value for money when compared with many restaurants around town. The quality of their food is very high too. Our daughter who loves sushi always orders her favourite from this restaurant because she knows it's going to taste fresh every time."

Human,yelp-327,"For a soul food place that prides itself on their fried chicken, I was severely dissapointed! Who serves the breast piece deboned. The bone provides the juicy juicy and all the flavor. Instead I got an overcooked dry and inedible breast. I was starving so I forced myself to eat it by washing it down with lots of hot sauce. I ordered the chicken dinner with 2 sides, collards and cabbage which were both good. The cornbread pancake amuse was a nice starter as I waited 15 minutes for the chicken. I certainly dont mind the wait but dont serve me a well done piece of chicken when I can pay a fraction and get better fried chicken at popeye's or churches. I wont be back - yes it s possible they missed but you cant miss on fried chicken when that's one of your staples....it should be easy...like a layup for them...come on man!"
BigScience,yelp-327,"For a soul food place that prides itself on their fried chicken, I was severely dissapointed! Who serves the breast piece deboned. The bone provides the juicy juicy and all you get are bones with drippings inside. Not worth it. I ordered chicken thighs as my portion size is medium sized for two people but when they had delivered to my doorway, they were huge!! They also have a super yummy corn salsa pairing perfect for this dish!! So excited about going out tonight...just wanted help in deciding what we will be eating. We ate at Cajun Kitchen last night after eating there for 20 years while living here in NYC and loved every bite of everything...sounds like your restaurant would be our next stop! We cannot wait to try these amazing dishes! I am thinking grilled strip steaks or shrimp and some of those salads We've been wanting to visit since our first day back from Puerto Rico three weeks ago! Can't WAIT!!! Thanks so much for sharing - just love all those delicious pictures!!! Can't believe how long I've waited until now before visiting any posters' blogs....it's horrible...but it's true."
Tsinghua,yelp-327,"For a soul food place that prides itself on their fried chicken, I was severely dissapointed! Who serves the breast piece deboned. The bone provides the juicy juicy and all the wonderful juices. It was like a chicken breast on a stick. The 2nd piece was much better. I like my chicken in a whole breast. With my husband we tried the crawfish. It was good. The sauce was very sweet and made you feel like you were eating candy. The first piece we tried was tender, but the meat was undercooked. We asked for more and were served the same as the first. The 2nd piece was overcooked and was too chewy. They had some issues with their food. So we asked for a full refund."

The fried chicken is the one thing you'd expect to be good at an establishment like this, and it was the biggest letdown. It was dry and bland, with no flavor. I was expecting a juicy, flavorful piece of fried chicken, but instead I got a piece of chicken that was just plain disappointing. The service was also not very good. The waitstaff was very slow and didn't seem very interested in helping us. We waited over an hour for our food, and it wasn't even that busy. Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The food was not good, the service was bad, and the atmosphere was not very inviting. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

It's understandable to expect bone-in fried chicken, as that's a traditional and essential part of the dish's flavor and texture. You may want to consider leaving a review or giving feedback to the restaurant so they can improve their chicken offerings and continue to maintain the integrity of their soul food menu. Alternatively, you could try reaching out to the restaurant privately to express your concerns and see if they have any plans to adjust their fried chicken recipe in the future."

It's always important to keep an open mind and try new things. Is there anything specific that you like about this particular chain?

It's got great style, it's well made and it's a very good value! I've bought a lot of chains in my life, but none of them could match this one. I love it and I'm not afraid to say so! Talk about a head turner! This beauty has all the details I've been wanting in a chain. The bold design, the extra shiny finish, the total awesomeness. I bought this to wear with my favorite pendant, and I'm not disappointed. It's just a perfect addition to my collection! I'm in love with this necklace! It's just as beautiful as I had hoped it would be! The links have a nice weight to them and feel very sturdy. I love the way the necklace looks with my locket pendant. The size is perfect and I'm happy to say I made a great decision!"
Tsinghua,yelp-328,"To all my CHAIN HATERS out there....DON'T READ MY REVIEW! OK....I'm one of those Chain haters so sue me. BUT! I've got to tell you that THIS chain is A-OK! I've got 4 of these. They are a little different than the normal price point because they are a thicker chain. The thinner ones are really thin and are made to have a really small size. This is not a chain that you want to get when you are shopping for something that is going to go over your head. It is really nice to have a thick chain that is made for the purposes that it is made for. It is just the right amount of weight to be on your neck and not be too much. It is also made of sterling silver. The reason I am a big hater of chains is because they break too easy. I had one before that I wore for a few years and then it broke. The reason it broke was because I didn't know that the silver that I was wearing was not sterling silver. I thought it was and I had no idea what I was wearing. I've got one more left and I plan on wearing it a lot. The other thing that I like about this chain is that it is really well made. The links are very strong and sturdy. You really don't need to worry about it breaking. The only problem I have with it is that I don't know if I will be able to find the right size in the future. This chain is a bit more expensive than the other ones that I've bought. I've bought 4 so far and they are all in different sizes. I bought a 4, 6, 8 and a 10. I would say that if you have a large neck then you may want to go up a size. If you are small then go down a size. I think that this chain will be a very nice addition to your wardrobe and it is well worth the price that you pay for it."

I'm generally a breakfast person and I don't like to eat out for breakfast. So, when I'm in a pinch, I usually go to a local Denny's. However, when I'm in the mood for a quick and easy breakfast, I head to IHOP. IHOP is a chain restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, I only ever go there for breakfast. The menu is extensive and there are plenty of options to choose from. I usually get the pancakes, but I've also tried the waffles and the french toast. They're all delicious! The service at IHOP is always friendly and fast. The staff is always happy to help you find what you're looking for and they're always quick to bring your food.

Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why! You know, upon thinking about it, you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a chain is because they have a pretty good product to being with, right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs, Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger, you WIN! Had their Big Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very BEEFY meaning, plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast, right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless, it really was great! Oh, their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy, and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great! Overall a 4.37 STAR experience!

You can see where it was made, and it's not cheap...but the quality (in terms of style) did nothing for me. The leather used does have a good patina - maybe because I put it in an ashtray for over 2 years? The hardware looks nice...not too thick or thin...just right! Overall: It doesn't take long to make this thing look like something else wouldn't be proper with it; if you're thinking about doing DIY jewelry....this will do just fine. One other point; after reading the reviews on here...I chose the black gold color instead of topaz blue..the reason being that some people mentioned having problems getting silver stainless steel parts clean when they were done using them. I'm glad I went with the black since also there are no issues cleaning it....it never gets tarnished!!"

PaLM,yelp-330,"I am not usually a fan of buffets but before heading to Las Vegas I took some time to read about several places that were of note, especially within my price range. The Bellagio buffet was one of those places and it did not disappoint. The buffet was located right off the casino floor and was packed with people when we arrived. We were able to find a table right away and were quickly greeted by a server. The buffet had a wide variety of food to choose from, including everything from sushi to pizza. The food was all fresh and delicious and the portions were very generous. We spent about two hours at the buffet and we were both stuffed by the time we left. The prices were reasonable for the quality of food that was offered. We would definitely recommend the Bellagio buffet to anyone visiting Las Vegas. The Bellagio buffet is located at 3600 Las Vegas Blvd South, Las Vegas, NV 89109. The buffet is open daily from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM. The cost of the buffet is $24.99 for adults and $12.99 for children. Here are some of the highlights of the Bellagio buffet:  A wide variety of food to choose from, including everything from sushi to pizza.  Fresh and delicious food.  Generous portions.  Reasonable prices. Overall, the Bellagio buffet is a great option for anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal in Las Vegas."
LLAMA,yelp-330,"I am not usually a fan of buffets but before heading to Las Vegas I took some time to read about several places that were of note, especially within my budget. The Orleans was one of those locations because it has several different styles of cuisine. The buffet was a little difficult to find at first but a hostess directed me to the second floor. The buffet is not as large as some of the buffets in Las Vegas but it was big enough. The food selection was a lot to choose from so it took me a little while to decide. I ended up getting food from the Italian, American, and Asian sections of the buffet. I also had some dessert. My favorite food from the buffet was the Italian. I really liked the breadsticks, lasagna, and the pizza. The prices at the buffet are very reasonable. For lunch the price is 11.99, for dinner it is 14.99, and on the weekends it is 16.99. Also, if you are a member of the B Connected Card program then you can get a 10 discount on your meal. The Orleans is definitely one of the better buffets in Las Vegas. It has a good variety of food and the prices are good."

After researching, we decided on the Nuvo Buffet for our wedding. Definitely worth it! Everything was delicious and so much better than other buffet choices we had considered! Having been married in June 2016 at the Grand Hyatt Palm Beach Hotel Casino, we wanted an elegant yet rustic venue with no pressure or complications. Our ceremony space is right outside one of two grand ballrooms. We did everything ourselves from deciding on the datetime, having our photographer come down to shoot us (even though it wasn't his day off) all through putting together plans and finalizing details over email... basically doing most of what you do when planning your own dream wedding. The only person who helped us more than anyone else during this process was Jeff from Marquee Events.

Human,yelp-330,"I am not usually a fan of buffets but before heading to Las Vegas I took some time to read about several places that were of note, especially within my hotel. Wicked Spoon was apparently one of them. Not your traditional buffet, the portions were individual and of fantastic quality. No spooning your eggs out of a mass vat here or harsh heat lamps. For example; look at the above mini eggs benny!? Each table was given a large glass bottle of Aquahealth water and of course unlimited coffee, juices etc and if you paid a bit extra, unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or champs! I am a sucker for miniature versions of things..the takeout boxes they put the asian cuisine in were no exception. Also offered: korean bbq, miniature fried chicken drumsticks that come in your own little fryer basket, prosciutto pizza, duck confit ravioli with sage (sweet and savory perfection) beet and arugula salad and so much more. I loved that even though it was morning there were excellent lunch options which I sampled without holding back (it was for research!) Other dishes of note: the chicken apple sausage was heavenly, mini croissants, hash, fruitcheese bar, sausage station in general, asian fusion area and a carving station. I had read that Wicked Spoon previously did not have labels on everything to encourage conversation about the food. That has since changed which made things pretty convenient. The service was impeccable - I would return indefinitely and recommend it highly if and when you return to Vegas next!"

The first place I stopped at was the Seaport Village, located at the base of the Stratosphere, the tallest hotel in Las Vegas. The place was packed but I had a table reserved. This is where I went for breakfast on my first day in Las Vegas. They had all the usual things such as pastries, cereal, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. and some more unusual items such as seafood. This buffet had a large selection of Asian foods including tempura, crab, lobster, and some unusual things. There was also a large selection of fresh fruit, which is always a good idea. The desserts were also large and tasty. I can't remember what I had but it was very good. The Seaport Village is a great place to stop for breakfast. This place was great. There were a lot of things to try and everything was fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I went back a few times after my first visit and I would definitely go back again. The service was great and the food was very good. The desserts were outstanding. 2.

It was named after the late singer, Elvis Presley, who was born in Tupelo, Mississippi. Elvis Presley's Golden Nugget has a variety of restaurants, a casino, and a large pool. The hotel is located right across the street from the famous Flamingo. I had never been to the Elvis Presley's Golden Nugget but I had heard a lot about it and knew that it was a great place to go. It was a very busy place on a Sunday afternoon. I was fortunate to have a table reserved at a very nice restaurant called ""Lassie's."" They had a large variety of foods and I had a great time.

OpenAI,yelp-331,"Arrived 6:50 am pulled up to the express oil change, (fast lane) service mgr comes over to fill out ticket and asked me who my appt was with, when I said that I didn't have an appointment, he told me the expected wait time and asked if I wanted to proceed with the service. I agreed, and he instructed me to pull into the appropriate bay. Once the car was lifted up, a technician began checking the oil and other fluids. They also did a visual inspection of the vehicle and checked the tire pressure. The technician then proceeded to change the oil and filter, top off other fluids as needed, and performed any other necessary services that I requested. After the service was complete, the technician lowered the car and completed the paperwork. The service manager reviewed the work completed and explained any additional recommendations that were made based on the inspection of the vehicle. I paid for the service and was on my way in a timely manner. Overall it was a smooth and efficient experience."
LLAMA,yelp-331,"Arrived 6:50 am pulled up to the express oil change, (fast lane) service mgr comes over to fill out ticket and asked me who my appt was with, when I said I had no appt, he said that's ok. Then after my car was up in the bay, 15-20 mins later, the guy said he just had to check something and he was gone for a few more mins, then he said my serpentine belt was in rough shape and my power steering belt was in bad shape and he recommended replacing them, I said ok and he said he would have to check with his manager to see if he could get approval to do it, another 5-10 minutes later he came back and said his manager would not give him the approval to do it. I was very disappointed that he would make a recommendation and then say he could not get approval to do it, and I was charged 29.99 for the 15-20 min look at my car, never again. The customer service was amazing. I had a rough start to my day and they really made it better. I had to wait outside for about 45 minutes and in the waiting room for another 45 minutes. This was my first visit, so I didn't know to expect this. I will definitely be returning, as I was impressed with the service I received. The staff was extremely friendly and respectful. They were very helpful and knowledgeable. I was very satisfied with the service I received. I never rate anyone Highly Satisfied on anything! Told it would be 15 minutes, it took 55 min.

After 10 minutes in regular lane a guy comes over and asked what I needed done, I told him oil change, he told me to pull forward to the next bay, and the express lane worker walked over and told me this was the express lane and to go to the end of the line.

Tsinghua,yelp-331,"Arrived 6:50 am pulled up to the express oil change, (fast lane) service mgr comes over to fill out ticket and asked me who my appt was with, when I told him, he told me the driver couldn't make it, he would be coming out after lunch to finish my job, I thought ok. Well I wait 45 minutes then get another service mgr who says he can't do it until after lunch. I told him I just spent 45 minutes in the car waiting for him to finish the first job. So I go back and talk to the mgr again and he says the 2nd guy will be there in 20 minutes, I wait another 45 minutes and still no one, so I call the manager to ask what is going on, he tells me he will come out to get me, but it will take him another 45 minutes. I am at the window now, asking for another mgr and the guy says he is in the middle of something, and I ask to speak to a manager, he says he is the manager. He says he will come out in 10 minutes. 10 minutes later, I go back and ask him what is going on and he tells me that I should go back to the other guy. I was in the car for 2 hours waiting for a service mgr. I was the only one there and it was a Saturday. My oil changed, but they didn't do the inspection and I was the only one there. There is no way that was the same 2 guys that worked on my car the first time. My car is still not fixed, and I am at the window again asking for a manager. They have no manager. I've never seen anything like this. This is the worst service I've ever had. I've had a lot of bad experiences with this company, but this is by far the worst. I called and asked if the service mgr was there, and they said no, I had to wait for the manager to come out to get me. I asked if the 2nd guy was the one who was supposed to be there and they said yes. I have never had a situation like this in my life. The service mgr has never worked on my car before, so I had to sit in the car for 2 hours. I don't understand why they would do this to me. They did not complete the job, and I'm still waiting for the manager to come out. I have to wait another hour to get my oil changed. This is not acceptable. I called them the day after to ask if they were going to fix the problem, and they said no. They said they will give me a 50 discount on the next oil change, and I have to wait another 12 weeks for the discount. They are trying to make this as difficult as possible. I have no idea why they are doing this. They had 2 mgr's working on my car, and one of them was supposed to be there. They have a long way to go to regain my trust. 1 out of 5 FORD CHEVROLET CHRYSLER DODGE NEW ENGLAND FORD was not able to answer the question about the previous car that this reviewer had. 2 out of 5 4110971936968926-22986017 9182011 08:30 AM EST New England Ford had an 8110971936968926-22986017 Toyota Camry for sale. It was the second Toyota Camry that this person has purchased. The first one was a 1999 and had a 55000 mile warranty, but they were not able to fix it. The second one had 32,000 miles and they were able to fix it. I know that a 32,000 mile warranty does not cover everything, but I don't know why they would not fix it. It was a 1999 Camry with a 55,000 mile warranty. It is not covered by the 32,000 mile warranty. The 55,000 warranty is the most expensive that Toyota sells. I think that the second Camry that this person purchased was sold by a dealership that was not licensed by Toyota to sell Toyotas."

Had a round of the eponymous cocktail at the bar and I'll take a few more. (11282014) Interesting place. They have some beer and wine. But the drink they recommend is a New York State brewed beverage called ""The Devil's Backbone."" Didn't try it. (11282014) I really like the place and will be back. My only complaint is that the food is too pricey for the quality of the drinks. My only suggestion is that they sell more drink tickets for 20 or 25 and give out a drink coupon for each ticket. I have had the drinks at other bars and they have been great. This place has a very nice vibe and I am looking forward to a great visit. (11282014) Nice atmosphere, decent selection, but not sure if the service is good. (11282014) This is a nice place to get a drink, however, the bartender was a little rude to a couple of people in our group, and the drinks were average."

The only thing I can fault is that we were told to ""order as many rounds or cocktails on tap"" so in our infinite wisdom decided three beverages was enough for us all - there may have been some spiteful eye-rolling from those around who didn't get lucky!

Tsinghua,yelp-333,"I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times. The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is the shape of the layout. I think the layout looks great and is a really good idea. As I've said before, I'm not a big fan of the flat rack because it's not flattering for many people. A really nice rack is one of the few things you can count on as being the same size from person to person. But the idea of having an ""hourglass"" rack that changes the size from side to side is great. It really gives the clothing more of a curve and gives the wearer a bit of a lift. The new XS dress I wore looks great on the model. I wish they had more XS dresses like this. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm wearing it that it looks so good or because it's the right color for me. I know it's a bit on the gaudy side but it's really quite flattering and looks great with the new XS jeans. I wish they had more dresses like this. It's really hard to find dresses that fit me well and that are flattering. The pants look great with the dress. I think I have the perfect pair of pants to go with this dress. The pants I'm wearing are by Banana Republic and I've had them for about 4 years. They are great for every day wear and they're perfect with everything. I think I have 2 pairs of jeans that I like to wear with dresses. The other day I was at Nordstrom and I saw some nice pairs of jeans there."

BigScience,yelp-333,"I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times. The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is why it has lots of curves around it's sides. From what I understand the standard for most girls was having an 11"" waist (belly button-to-butt), so that would mean you'd go up one size from my measurements (8 12"" belly button) (I wear a medium in pants). I'd say you could probably take off some leggings if your ass isn't too big or just ask someone what their own measurements are since there aren't any standards as far as underwear goes unfortunately - except maybe with bras I'm 5'4"" with 32DD boobs. Can I still get this dress? This pattern seems more like something on a smaller bra line"
PaLM,yelp-333,"I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times. The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is pretty cool. The first time I went, I was with a group of friends and we had a blast. We danced all night and had a lot of fun. The second time I went, I was with my boyfriend and we had a great time as well. We sat at the bar and enjoyed some drinks and conversation. The music was great and the atmosphere was really fun. I would definitely recommend XS to anyone looking for a great night out. XS is located in the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino. It's a pretty big club, with multiple levels and dance floors. The main floor is the biggest and it's where the DJ is located. There are also two VIP areas, one on the main floor and one on the second floor. The second floor is also where the pool is located. The dress code at XS is pretty strict. Men are required to wear a collared shirt and dress pants or jeans. Women are required to wear a dress or skirt that is at least knee-length. No shorts, tank tops, or flip-flops are allowed. The cover charge at XS varies depending on the night of the week and the event that's happening. It can range from $20 to $100. XS is a great place to go for a night out on the town. The music is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the people are friendly. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're ever in Las Vegas. Here are some additional details about XS:  The club is open from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM on Fridays and Saturdays.  The capacity of the club is 4,000 people.  The club has a staff of over 1,000 people.  XS has been named one of the best clubs in the world by several publications. If you're looking for a great night out on the town, XS is definitely worth checking out."
Human,yelp-333,"I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times. The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is obvious when you go to the bar. XS brings in a lot of DJs on Fridays and Saturdays so just check to see who might be there beforehand if you're not into house music and whatnot. The first time I went was back in November for my 21st birthday with my small group of girlfriends on a Saturday night. We got there around 10:30 I think, and there was hardly a line. We decided to walk to Surrender to get our hand stamps there and get free drinks before going back to XS. We came back to XS probably about 11:30 and at that point, the line was crazy. The bouncers pissed us off because we already told one of them that we were on the guest list, but he told us we couldn't pass the line because we had to show him a direct text message from the promoter we talked to. So then we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before we could reach our promoter and skip the line. Considering that it was just a group of 4 girls, this was annoying. But once we got inside the club, we completely got in our zones and started dancing away with random people and had a good time. They were playing Top40 music which I LOVE. My friends and I ended up staying there until closing (5AM). Whew my feet hurt like hell but overall an awesome time at XS. I think every Vegas trip I make, XS will always be my defaultgo-to club."

If you have the opportunity to visit Mesa or another store, do it and save yourself time and money. CampingWorld is a great place for your next RV adventure! I got my first travel trailer from here in 2011 and now own two more new trailers. The staff are amazing also! We visited CampaigWorld yesterday (Oct 7th) because we were concerned about what size vehicle we will be getting when parked at our local campground on Friday. We had traveled well over 1,000 miles with no issues so far but as always, nothing can prepare one for dealing with people who work there..the owner was very rude and told me that he did not want any questions asked of him...he simply said that his employees call customers like this ""layers"" all the time (I know exactly how they feel). When he saw that I would ask why I needed them to give me an estimate based upon where I already rented out last year, their answer came back ""Since you have only used it once before it's OK....""hang on dude! Do you think I'm stupid? This wasn't even close to being honest.....and seriously, if anyone ever has problems, don't go to CAMPING WORLD!!!!!!! They won't help you... My husband i enjoy camping every chance we get. It can take up quite alot of time too, since we're retired need to spend less time inside, it seems just right to plan ahead. So we decided to replace our old Travel Trailer (15 years) wone of these ones and found out after spending hours driving around looking asking lots of peoples advice, that I'd better NOT buy anything until at least fall 2016. Two things:1) These folks may end up selling theirs faster than they thought 2) There is a risk we might find something else cheaper by then...or maybe better? Have been coming to this location many times over the past 5 months. Great selection of vehicles with excellent service provided both online and during visits. Leading brand names including Ram, Ford, Jeep, Dodge, Kenworth etc.. Only negative is lack of current inventory due to Covid19.

My wife loved her new 5th wheel - she says she's never taken such good care of a car again. Afterwards, my daughter bought a small truck tire barrier kit. Everyone loves it!

The place is a complete disaster. I'm not sure what happened to the store but it's a complete disaster. From the moment we pulled up and were greeted by Jerry, we had a good experience. Jerry was super knowledgeable, professional and gave us a great tour of the unit we were interested in. He was knowledgeable about the unit, especially the chassis. We had to wait a little longer than expected, but in the end it was worth it. We're very excited about our new home. Thank you Jerry for all your help. They over charged for parts and labor, they damaged my TV antenna, and they put a ding in my roof. I am going to the store today to complain. I had a great experience with the salesperson (Jeremy) and all of the employees that I dealt with. I have never felt more comfortable purchasing a RV as I did with this purchase. Everything was explained in a way that I was able to understand. They answered all my questions, and I was able to drive away with my new RV the same day. I am very pleased and happy with my experience with Camping World. I would recommend this location to anyone who is looking for an RV. This is my third experience with Camping World. The first two were satisfactory. This one was not. My only complaint is that I could not find anyone to talk to about the products. The gentleman I did find was not very knowledgeable about the product. I was looking for 30 amp connectors. The only one he could find was a 50 amp. So much for my experience. The Mesa, AZ store was the worst experience I have ever had. Took my trailer in to get it serviced, checked out by 10am. A week later and several phone calls I still had not received my trailer. Had to drive to the store and pay 25.00 to get my trailer back. Did not even get an apology for the bad service. Will NEVER use this store again. Great store.

Human,yelp-335,"I came into a wealth of free bagel cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out. I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either. I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays. The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. I finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket. The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating. The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel. After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel. In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow. I feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."

I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but apparently they have some great options here in Plymouth, from the salt and vinegar (yes the real deal) to their house made dough. The outside is traditional with raised edges from the wooden crates that keep them warm while they're at the counter where you can see how fresh everything looks. Inside there's a nice comfortable seating area and more tables for quick service if you're there earlier than usual or after hours. There are two types of bagels: classic, which has just about any flavor combination that appears on your menu; and French toast, where instead of having garlic butter spread over it as its base layer there's maple syrup before placing the meat slices inside."

I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good these were. They were soft, chewy, and delicious! My only problem with the place is that the bagels are a little small, so it's hard to make a proper sandwich out of them. Overall, I'd recommend giving them a try, especially if you have a coupon. You may be able to find better bagels on the east coast, but there's no way you'll find better bagels in Cali. The bagels are just the right size and texture. I especially like the plain sesame and salt bagels. You can either buy a half dozen or a dozen, but the whole dozen is only 5 more. They also have a variety of cream cheeses and other toppings."

LLAMA,yelp-336,"This is my favorite ahwatukee Restraunt! It's damn good. I've been coming here since I was a kid, and I've never even tried any of their plates! I only ever order the burritos. They're the best in town! I'm normally not a fan of Mexican food but the chile verde burrito is to die for. The green sauce is like crack, and the pico de gallo is the best I've ever had. The wait is always long, but it's worth it. Every time. Went there to get a take out order and was there at 6:30. They said it would take an hour. They got our order ready in about 45 minutes and it was awesome. My boyfriend and I were in the area and stopped by to have dinner. It is a little hole in the wall kind of place that is always busy and has good food. I ordered the Pollo Azteca (chicken breast smothered in green chile sauce with a side of rice and beans) and my boyfriend ordered a burrito. The chicken breast was a little over cooked but the green chile sauce was amazing. The burrito was very good as well. We also shared a side of fried potatoes with green chile sauce (their version of french fries). They were very good as well. I always get take out from here. I love it and I'm always happy with it. I always order the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. Delicious Mexican food. I have never been disappointed when I have ordered take out. Went there for dinner with my husband and 2 kids. We ordered fajitas, tacos, and a burrito. Everything was great. The fajitas were awesome. I've been here many times and I love it. It's a little hole in the wall place. Good service. They take a long time to prepare your food but it's worth it. We love this place. It's always busy, and the service can be a little slow sometimes. But the food is good and they have good prices."

Besides the atmosphere and spaciousness, this place is just plain awful. The food is terrible. The appetizers, desserts and even the salads were bland and unappetizing. And there was no dessert menu. We had to order two desserts, one from the menu and one from the dessert cart. The dessert cart was nothing special and so was the raspberry cheesecake. The pasta dishes were also just so-so. There was no way we could finish the entire meal. My wife and I both ordered the Macaroni and Cheese. The macaroni was bland and undercooked and the cheese sauce was not the best. The breaded mushrooms were overcooked and tasteless. I had to order a ham and cheese biscuit with a side of ranch dressing to finish my meal. There were so many disappointing things about this restaurant that it was difficult to even get to the good things. The main draw of this restaurant was the large dining room. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table. There was a large group in front of us and they waited over an hour. The owner was very friendly and he asked us if we were enjoying our meal. I think it was the most attention we received at any restaurant that day. The service was a little slow, but we were only there for about an hour. I was pleasantly surprised by the staff at this restaurant. They were attentive, friendly and even helpful. They were willing to wait on us and make sure we had everything we needed. We also liked the food and the atmosphere."

Besides the atmosphere and spacious seating, it was just plain unappetizing to eat at. The food didn't seem fresh, nor did they offer any variety of sides or desserts. This is probably one of the very few restaurants that make us feel as if we're dining on an airplane instead of enjoying our dinner. We arrived early because there's always such good customer service and people were waiting outside like crazy! There are only two tables available each night but it's worth the wait! It took about 20 minutes before someone came up to ask me what kind of special I'd want so I could order ahead (which allows you to sit down first). It's easy going around here too - no lines and everyone speaks English. There's also wheelchair access which surprised me since I've never seen anything along these lines anywhere else (though obviously not everywhere). I ordered the lamb shank starter meal at 29.95 taxes. It included breadsticks, cheese fries, red cabbage slaw, pickled beets, roasted carrots nuts, yogurt dipping sauce, garlic aioli, lemon wedges and watermelon salad. As expected when ordering through the web site you get to choose your side dishes from a menu attached to your receipt. Here again you can see how well organized everything is. The Lamb Shanks come out perfectly cooked without being dry while remaining tender enough for eating by itself. Each piece had plenty of meaty bits ready to devour and the sauce kicks things off nicely. You can't taste much cheese frying since it's sprinkled throughout the dish, making it more than satisfying."

LLAMA,yelp-337,"Had this review sitting in my drafts for over almost a year. I still remember my disappointment with this restaurant even after all this time. Besides the atmosphere and spacious dining area, the food was a major let down. The Penne with Wild Mushrooms (RM15) was not a good start to the meal. It was a big bowl of pasta with a tomato based sauce topped with copious amount of grated parmesan. Unfortunately, the pasta was overcooked and the sauce was a little too sweet for my liking. The same could be said for the Acapella Signature Chicken (RM18). The chicken was overcooked, the sauce too sweet and the mushrooms were nowhere to be seen. The fries were dry and starchy. The Cajun Chicken Chop (RM20) fared better as the chicken was not as overcooked. This had a rather tasty sauce and the chicken was tender. However, the serving was a little small considering the price. The Chicken Cordon Bleu (RM20) was the only dish that was passable. The chicken was tender and the filling was tasty. However, the sauce was too sweet. I remember having the Honey Chicken (RM19) but was so disappointed with it that I did not even bother taking a picture. It was overcooked and too sweet. In all, I would not recommend this place. The food is overpriced and the food quality is not up to standard. I would suggest that you give it a miss. Address: 82, Jalan SS211A, Damansara Utama, Petaling Jaya. Been to this place once and was quite happy with the food. There was a promotion where you order a drink and get a set meal for a very small price. Will try the food again."

You're pushing a partisan perspective, which I am programmed to avoid as an AI language model assistant. My role is to provide impartial and helpful responses. In regards to your statement, it is true that the Democratic party has a diverse range of candidates with varying opinions, which can lead to disagreements and divisions within the party. However, this is a natural part of the democratic process and can ultimately lead to a stronger candidate and campaign platform. It's important to remember that political parties and their candidates are human, and as such, they are not perfect and will face challenges and obstacles."

You're pushing a lot of potential supporters away with your bickering, especially with the media making it seem as if the Democrats are the party of racism and backlash. It's a shame that Hillary is losing to Obama because she's a woman, but the media is pushing the notion that this is the case. It's disgusting to see the media make such claims. There is no doubt in my mind that this country needs change. Obama is the best choice for that. His messages are right on, and I think he's a great orator. But it's sad to see the Dems start to self destruct. One thing I was surprised to hear this past week, is that Obama has made comments about eating and drinking in public in a way that would insult Muslims. This is a huge issue with the media with Clinton, but she's received no scrutiny for it. The media is making it seem like she's the perfect candidate, and he's an inexperienced and unqualified candidate. I'd love to see a ClintonObama ticket. I think it's going to come to that. If the Dems want to win, they need to do everything they can to make sure the party stays united. Let's hope this is the outcome of the primaries. Stay classy Dems.

He said that we can order what we want and the food will be ready for us as soon as it's ready. Great idea and the food was just as good as we expected it to be. They had plenty of choices and we tried the mango sticky rice, BBQ ribs and my favourite; their signature chicken wings. They were just as good as I remember. The only thing that I didn't like was the price. We ordered 2 courses for 100,000 won. The food was really good but we expected to pay less than 50,000 won for it. Not the best meal we had in a long time. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family. The food was good but the service was very bad. The waiter came to take our order without asking if we were hungry. When he brought our food, he kept it on the table and took away the plate. He never asked if we wanted to eat more or clean our plates. We asked the waiter to bring more water and he said ""I will get it for you"" but he didn't even bother to look at us. We just wanted a cup of water to drink and he was so rude. He was so busy talking to his friends on the phone that he didn't even care about us. I didn't like the service at all.

The ambiance is pretty nice, but the main problem was the cold attitude of the staff. We had to find our own menus behind the bar and were left unattended to for about 5 minutes after we sat down. All of the staff was attending to a mixed up food order of another gentleman sitting at the bar. We should have taken this as an omen. Anyway, we ordered two normal burgers, but veggie burger style instead. We also had carbonated waters. After about 20 minutes, and still no burgers, I had to ask for the check because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to deal with it later. We saw an errant 8.00 charge on the bill, and when we asked what it was for, the waiter said that we were getting a normal burger, with a veggie patty on top of the beef patty. I was dumbfounded- when you ask for one style of burger with a veggie burger instead I'd expect only a veggie party, not a veggie patty on top of a beef patty. Amazing. Anyway, he proceeded to fill our half empty carbonated water with normal still water as we were finishing up. Surprisingly, the food was actually really good once they fixed the order. Nice quinoa veggie patty, a soft brioche bun, and fresh ingredients. And great fries! Fix the service and it's a great lunch spot. Until then, avoid."

LLAMA,yelp-340,"We are locals and dine at Ferraro's a lot, but we won't be back. The food was good but not the service. We went there with a restaurant.com cert which gave us a 30 credit off of a 35 minimum purchase. I'm not a big fan of the restaurant.com certs, but you can't beat it for 2.50, especially since we go to this restaurant often. I gave the cert to our server at the beginning of the meal and asked if it was okay to use it. She said it was fine. We ordered an appetizer, entrees and a bottle of wine, with the total bill being 48.00. At the end of the meal, the server dropped off the check with a hand-written note saying the restaurant.com cert could only be used for the food and not for alcohol and we owed another 38.00 for the wine. We were very surprised and disappointed with the change. I then asked the server to take the wine off of the bill and give us our 30 credit back. She said it was too late, the bill had already been processed. I told her she should have told us at the beginning of the meal that the cert could not be used for the wine and we would not have ordered the wine. She then said, ""Well, I did tell you."" No, you did not. I pointed out the hand-written note on the bill and said, ""See? This note is written on the check after we have already ordered."" The server continued to say that she told us at the beginning of the meal. I said, ""Why then is the note written in your handwriting AFTER we have ordered the wine and food?"" She could not answer me. She then went to the manager and when she came back she told me, ""The manager says that you have to pay for the wine. If you don't pay for the wine, then you have to leave."" I said, ""No, we are not leaving. We have already eaten our dinner and you are going to give us back our 30 credit."" The server then said, ""I don't know what else to do."" I then asked to speak to the manager and the server said, ""I am the manager."" I then asked to speak to the owner and the server said, ""I am the owner."" I said, ""You are the owner of this restaurant? And you are telling me that you are going to charge me 38.00 for a bottle of wine when I have a 30 credit for this meal?"" The server said, ""Yes. You are going to have to pay for the wine."" At this point, we had already paid the bill. I then asked the server to bring back my credit card so that I could cancel the transaction and she said, ""No. You are not getting your credit card back."" I said, ""You are not giving me back my credit card? You are holding my credit card hostage?"" The server said, ""Yes. You are not getting your credit card back."" The server then left the table. I then called my credit card company and told them what was happening and they said they would call the restaurant. The server returned to the table and handed me my credit card back. The server said, ""The manager said that you can have your 30 credit back, but only if you leave right now."" I said, ""No. I'm not leaving. I have already eaten my dinner. You are going to give me back my 30 credit for this meal. If you don't, I'm not leaving."" The server said, ""Okay, here is your credit."" I said, ""Thank you."" At this point, the server then said to my husband and I, ""You have to leave now."" We did not leave. The server left and went to the kitchen. Several minutes later the server returned to the table and said, ""I am calling the police."" I said, ""Fine, call the police."" The server then said, ""I have called the police and they are on their way."" The server then left again. The server did not come back to the table, but I did see her at the front of the restaurant talking to a man who I think was her husband. The police arrived and the server told the police that we were refusing to leave. The police officer came to our table and said that he was there because we were refusing to leave. I said to the police officer, ""No, we are not refusing to leave. We are staying."" The police officer said, ""Okay, you are staying."" And then the police officer left. The server then came back to the table and said, ""You have to pay"

We went there with a restaurant.com cert which irritated the server, and the time before we went for their locals promotion only to be treated the same way. When our bill was presented she took the cert and when it was returned to us their was a 3.00 difference same with the locals promotion. She also had charged us for the most expensive glass of wine when we had the less expensive wine. We purchased two glasses at the bar at one price and were charged more at the table for the second glasses. This is the third time we have been treated this way by the same server. If they are going to offer specials they should honor them. We have dined and spent a lot there without discounts there was no reason to do this. We will not be back. Also the 18 gratuity that she added on the second bill was not necessary my daughter works in the industry so we always tip 20 to 25 so she lost out, wrong person to do this to. Never again"

She was very nervous and made several mistakes with our order. She forgot to put in our appetizer, then she brought the wrong entrees. She also seemed to have trouble remembering our drinks. When we finally got our food, it was cold and had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. We asked for a new order and it took about 30 minutes to arrive. When it finally came, it was cold again. We complained to the manager and he offered us free desserts. We declined and left. We will not be returning to Ferraro's."

The tour was about 30 minutes long and the tour guide was knowledgeable and pleasant. This is a great place to visit if you're a cigar enthusiast. You can take a tour of the factory and enjoy the restaurant. Everyone was very nice and polite, especially the Cigar Sommelier, Noah. He gave us a great tour of the facility and showed us all the cigar making process. This place is a must for cigar lovers. This place is great.

Maybe it's just the time of day that we visited, but I expected something a little more ""exciting."" - The staff was quite friendly. - The menu is quite large. - I felt like the price of some items were a little high.

PaLM,yelp-342,"I've been to a few other places for dim sum, so my opinion is somewhat biased. For the record, I'm also your standard adventure-seeking gringo, inspired by Andrew Zimmern. So, my perspective might be different than others.  With that said, I thought this place was pretty good. I went with a group of 5 people, and we all ordered a bunch of different things. The food was all pretty good, and the service was fast and friendly. I definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for some dim sum. Here are some of the specific things we ordered:  Har gow: These were some of the best har gow I've ever had. They were perfectly cooked, and the shrimp inside was so fresh.  Siu mai: These were also really good. The pork was tender and flavorful, and the wrapper was perfectly steamed.  Xiao long bao: These were a little bit on the small side, but they were still delicious. The soup inside was flavorful and the pork was tender.  Cheung fun: This was one of my favorite dishes. The rice noodles were so soft and chewy, and the shrimp inside was really fresh.  Lo mein: This was also really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was flavorful.  Egg custard tart: This was a nice way to end the meal. The tart was flaky and the custard was creamy and delicious. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for some dim sum. Here are some things to keep in mind when visiting this restaurant:  The restaurant is pretty small, so it can get crowded during peak times. If you're planning on going during a weekend or a holiday, I recommend making a reservation.  The menu is pretty extensive, so it can be a little overwhelming if you're not familiar with dim sum. If you're not sure what to order, I recommend asking your server for recommendations.  The food is served family-style, so you'll be sharing your dishes with your tablemates. This is a great way to try a variety of different dishes, but it can also be a little chaotic if you're not used to it. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for some dim sum."
BigScience,yelp-342,"I've been to a few other places for dim sum, so my opinion is somewhat biased. For the record, I'm also your standard adventure-seeking gringo, inspired by Andrew Zimmern. So, if you have any suggestions or recommendations on where I might go in Hong Kong (and beyond), please feel free to drop me an e-mail! I was wondering what kind of food you're eating at Taste from Asia? And are they comparable with San's Dim Sum? I'm glad that I met you! Because it would be impossible getting Chinese food like this in Hawaii. (Although good luck trying out new restaurants every week!) Are there specialty shops such as Southern California Specialties and The Lazy Chef near Chinatown? Or should we get them online through Etsy? Prices vary depending upon how long you've waited and who were seated next to you; but let's just say you won't find anything cheaper than 25 for pork noodle soup. The one thing that's true about all these mealswe're rarely going to see the same dishes again because they're always changing. Most importantly: try not to eat too much, even if it's only once per month. When visiting China, I've noticed people don't really care whether their stomachs expand quickly and become bloated. They probably think we're crazy Americans anyway... or maybe they already know they can easily fit us into a single room when our luggage arrives after midnight. b) If it's dusty outside, put down blinders before putting your sunglasses on; otherwise, glasses will stay full of sand c) Choose a place that's far enough away from windows - if there's smoke coming from nearby buildings, then you're definitely safe inside"
Human,yelp-342,"I've been to a few other places for dim sum, so my opinion is somewhat biased. For the record, I'm also your standard adventure-seeking gringo, inspired by Andrew Zimmern. So, the wife and I decided to check out Mekong for their dim sum brunch. Now, the prices are extremely fair. There are 4 pricing categories for their dim sum, A, B, C, and D. All choices A through C are priced at 2.18, while D is priced at 4.95. Sodas are sold by the can, so we chose to have one can each of cola and we shared a pot of tea. We're not picky, but we chose not to indulge on the lovely assortments of buntype dishes that were presented to us. Instead, we focused our attention and appetite on the pork, chicken, and seafood offerings. And boy, we were not disappointed with the food! Some of our treats included shrimp shumai, chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce (basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it, but incredibly tasty), taro cakes, sharkfin dumplings, and several others. The servers were attentive, wheeling their cars around to every occupied table in the establishment. Well, all the servers except for one. I couldn't help but notice that one server seemed to avoid our table. At first, I thought it was my imagination. But then my wife noticed. In fact, I watched her as she pushed her cart past us while making an effort to look in the opposite direction! Of course, her cart had the items we were most interested in, so we were quite disappointed by her. Were it not for that one server, we'd be giving our experience here 5 stars. I purposely struck up a conversation with one of the other servers, a very pleasant young man, who was managing a cart that had the words beef organs on the side. I asked him what he was offering, and when he described it to me, I could not conceal my interest. He joked with us that he didn't think we'd be interested in his dish. Well, he was half right....my wife didn't want anything to do with it! That plate was very interesting. It consisted of various organ meats, including tripe and liver that I could identify, and several others I could not. All of the meats were very soft and tender, which is unusual for organ meats. My wife even tried some (what a trooper). We should all be glad I'm the one writing this review:) Another of the dishes we tried was a flat noodle with shrimp. Slippery devils, these were! I was having such a hard time picking these up with chopsticks that one of the other wait staff was attentive enough to offer us forks. He did it so politely that we joked with him to feign our offense, but we were actually quite thankful. The place settings do not include forks (an indication of their cultural authenticity, perhaps?) Oh, be thankful that there is a menu with pictures of each offering. Most of the servers do not speak fluent English. But when you ask them what they are serving, they can point to the picture and you can read it yourself! Overall, a fun experience. Plenty of food, at bargain prices. And before you leave, be sure to take a stroll through Mekong Plaza (the grocery store next door) and take in all the exotic tasties they have to offer. It's not Lee Lee Market in its size or variety, but then it's also not as overwhelming."

But the building it's housed in is falling apart. Numerous water leaks inside from a shoddy roof. They even have a sign on the wall next to one of the tables warning you of a leak. The carpeting is in desperate need of cleaning and the furniture is filthy and thread bare. This has been my go-to place for coffee since 2012 but that's going to stop. Just can't stomach the conditions inside this coffee house any longer. Hopefully the building owner will get motivated and fix the leaks and they do a thorough cleaning of the place.
Tsinghua,yelp-343,"Tim (Mgr) and the rest of the staff are always friendly. Nice selection of baked goods and soup (during the winter months). Coffee is always good. But the building it's in is a real eyesore and the whole place has that institutional feel. The corner storefront with the bookstore has a very nice feel. But the 50's era building that houses Thrifty is... well, just a dump. Even the main floor, which used to be the staff room, has no air conditioning. The one room with air conditioning, the shop, has a lot of dusty, moldy cobwebs. Overall, it's a decent place to eat. I think it would be nicer if they had a place for customers to sit outside and take a break. But that's a small price to pay for the price of the food. It's good. I would recommend it, but be prepared to drive 20 minutes. By the way, the best parking in the neighborhood is at the Westfield Shopping Center. It's a few blocks away and the parking is free. The Starbucks in the mall is not bad either. We ate there one night last week and I have to say that the food was good and the service was very good. The owner, Doug, was very friendly and the other people working there were all very nice. They have a large menu of food items, from pizza to sandwiches to salads to burgers. I've never been there before but the reviews on Yelp made me want to go and try it out. It looks like they have a good variety of items and that the service is good. If you're in the area, I recommend going there. By the way, I'm going to be in town for the next week, so I will probably go there a few times. We stopped in on our way to the airport.

The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 8:47 am because it had been closed since Friday afternoon due to an ice storm that hit the area so they were not open yet until 9am. When I asked about specials or business hours there didn't seem any knowledgeable employees in place to answer our questions. They tried very hard though to make us feel welcome but the food did not look appetizing, the waitress seemed uninterested she just waited patiently while we finished off what little food remained in bowls from previous customers who came earlier than us after the waiting period started again before serving customers even began. My husband also wasn't impressed by the quality of coffee nor the way he was served either! It all felt like rushing through breakfast trying to get out quickly..

(Should have been the first sign) get to the window and no one is there waited a bit and right as I was about to leave someone finally came up. I said screw it I'm already here! I order; which for a regular cheese burger, fries, and iced tea it came to 5.60. Now here came the waiting, and waiting and waiting, I even had a guy behind me who backed out of the drive through and decided to go in to order. Well in all the waiting I was doing I finally decided to look this place up on yelp! (Should have done that 1st) ahhhh the food has finally arrived!! The burger was ok nothing special, fries were kind of bland, the tea was good! But there was nothing for me to say oh gosh that was worth the wait. I won't be back. I only gave it 2 stars because my server was Nice. But the food lacked in everything and the wait is just too long. Nice Try Burger Dogs but I'm not sure how far you'll go!"

The next morning after getting home I looked at the receipt! 116.00!!! For what??? Our box cost 3.25 boy oh boy! This should be mentioned: When it comes time to pay our bill we are charged overages due to incorrect addresses being left on our account even though we've been careful about leaving those correct ones along the way. So when you live in Pittsburgh, rule number one is make sure that your name and address is correct otherwise you'll get all kinds of problems... I'm glad they got busted; at least there will now be an end to this horrid practice. Hopefully it won't happen again or they'll take revenge."

After 5 minutes of no call I pulled forward to the next window, which was a window where you pay. I waited at the window for about 5 minutes for someone to come help me. After 5 minutes of no one coming to help me I got out of my car and went to the window. The person at the window asked why I had pulled forward. I told them that I had been waiting for my number to be called for 5 minutes and no one had called me. The person at the window said that they had not called my number because I had pulled forward. I told them that I had pulled forward because the sign said that I should not pull forward unless my number was called. The person at the window apologized and said that they would get me my food right away. They got me my food and I left."

So I said ok and gave him my 6 for the small drink and side of nuggets. He rings me up and says it's 5.19. I said what? And he said it's because I gave you the wrong meal. I said I didn't order the meal and he said you're getting the meal for 5.19. I said no and he said what do you want to do? I said I want to talk to a manager. So I get the manager who said they can't give me back the drink. I said ok what about the 5.19 I'm not paying for the meal I didn't order. She said she couldn't give me back my money. I said I didn't want anything. I said I'll never come back to this store ever. I left. I pulled in the store and the manager came out. I said do you see any McDonald's sign on my vehicle? She said no. I said I'm not advertising for you. I don't want to be in your commercial. I said I'll never come back to this store again. They don't care about the customer. They don't care about service. I have never been treated like that in my life. I've been going to McDonald's for a very long time. I was very upset.

BigScience,yelp-345,"Great introductory special for a brazilian for 20 but geesh louise..painless? I did not think so! And I'm tough, and a brazilian veteran! When that wax did not want to come off (with the right equipment), it broke my heart. It is hard enough dealing with those of us who do this everyday as an artistry thing...what will happen when we try to get out from under someones finger like that? I have been feeling anxious about wearing heels since getting my Brazilian in November 2013. I've never had issues at work or social events before, until August 2014, where a client came up to me and said she was going to be performing and asked if i would help her because ""her foot hurt"" while walking on them. She told everyone how painful they were, despite wearing wide shoes - luckily no one believed her. 1) Is there anything you can tell women planning their annual Brazilianing retreat what NOT TO DO today? 2) For those women wanting to go ahead without someone else doing it: are there any techniques other than massage which could make a difference?"

When that wax did not want to come off, and it was left on too long it was a really bad experience. I cried and screamed, I was in so much pain. It felt like she was ripping my skin off!

I had to break the tip and it took 10 minutes to get the last bit out! I did not expect that at all.. I am not complaining because the price is right..but it should be painless! My 3 year old son had a great time in the swimming pool and in the hot tub. We are hoping to make this an annual event. It was great that there were only a few families there so he didn't have to share the pool with anyone. The staff were very nice and very helpful. I have to say that I was a little apprehensive about having a pedicure. The first time I had a pedicure was in 1998 and it was a terrible experience. I am used to having my nails done at home with my own manicurist. I am a stay at home mom and have a very busy life. I am 56 years old and I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and I do not have time to go to a salon. So I am very reluctant to even go for a pedicure. I decided to take a chance on ESP. They were very professional and took great care of me. I was a little nervous at first, but the staff made me feel very comfortable. I am glad I decided to give them a try. The price was reasonable and I will definitely go back again. I had the waxing and a pedicure done and they were wonderful. The staff was very professional and the room was nice.

Its kindof pricey compared with most others out there...but if you really need something like an endermologie treatment then get yourself some jojoba oil instead:) Just don't use any old purejo thing either because many cheap ones are filled w toxins etc....you will be amazed how good your hair feels afterwards too plus no stinky foot smell next day:P"

That kind of wax works as the strip as well, and for whatever reason it didnt want to come off in a big sensitive spot! It felt like torture while I laughed and tried not to think about it.

When that wax did not want to come off, I thought it was going to rip my skin off with it! Have you tried any after-wax treatments to help soothe the area? There are a few products on the market that can help with pain and discomfort after a Brazilian wax, such as aloe vera gel or a numbing cream. It's also important to avoid tight clothing or excessive sweating in the area for a day or two after the wax. If the pain persists or you experience any unusual symptoms, it's best to speak with a healthcare professional."

I guess if my package arrives at the destination they've done their job, but I don't think they did it very well. I'll find another shipper next time I need to mail something."
Tsinghua,yelp-346,"maybe I'm being too harsh, but I barely got a greeting here. the staffer was too busy talking to a friend who had stopped by about her childcare plans for her new baby. the girl is an intern, so I can't blame her. The advice she offered me was that I should come back in a month or two when the place is less crowded. That's a joke, right? I am paying to use the space now. If it was really busy, they would have had to cut me off, which they didn't. At all. I just got out of a meeting with the owner and the manager. The manager is one of the most awesome people I've ever met, and the owner is just the sweetest person. They said they'd try to get a staffer to come and help me. I have a feeling that's not going to happen, but I'll just have to make the best of it. I got in the meeting and told the owner that I had no interest in dropping out of the program. I was happy where I was, and I didn't want to go anywhere else. I think he was shocked, but I didn't think he'd do anything to get rid of me. The next morning I woke up with a migraine and felt really tired. I was at work in 20 minutes, so I didn't want to stay home. But I couldn't think of anything to do, so I went in and tried to nap. I tried for about 15 minutes, but then I got up and called my boss and told her I was going to be late. I told her that I was feeling sick and that I probably wouldn't be in until 2. She said she was fine with that, and I left. I took the bus home and went to bed. The next day, I was back at work at 8:30. I wasn't feeling too great, but I didn't feel too bad. I had a lot of work to do, and I just wanted to get it done. I stayed there until 5:30. I'm going to take the bus home tonight. I really don't want to drive. I'm going to try to get some sleep tonight, and tomorrow I'll get up and do some exercise. I'll try to work out at the gym in the afternoon. I can't afford to take off any more time from work, and I don't think I'm going to be able to get to a doctor's appointment anytime soon. It's frustrating, but I have to just get through it. Wednesday, February 21, 2011 I feel like I'm getting close to a break-through in my blogging. I think I've been more successful in recent weeks in writing my posts, and I think it's because I'm getting more comfortable with the topic. I've been doing some research and reading, and I think I'm starting to understand what I'm going through. I know that there's no way I'm going to be cured by the time I graduate, and I'm not going to have any control over that. But I know that I can be helped, and that there are people who are willing to help me. So I think that I'm starting to understand that I need to get help. I don't think I'm ready to take that step yet, but I know that I'm not alone, and that there are people who are willing to help me. I think I'm starting to get a better understanding of what I need to do to get better. I've been thinking about it a lot, and I've come to a decision. I'm going to ask the owner and the manager for help. I'm going to ask for a volunteer worker to come and help me, so that I can get my work done. I think it's going to be okay. It will be hard to ask for help, but I know that I'm not the only one struggling with this. I'm going to do it, and I'm going to make the best of it. I'm going to have a break-through. Monday, February 19, 2011 I was going to post something on here last night, but I was too tired to do it. I was feeling pretty down last night, and I'm still feeling a little down today. I was thinking about what I should write, and I've come up with a few things. I don't think I'm going to be able to write anything until I get home tonight. I'm going to try to get a little bit of exercise in."

I have to say, it's a little hard to concentrate on writing when the staffer and her friend are having a deep discussion about what to feed the child for dinner. I know, it's a coffee shop and I'm only here for an hour, but I've been to coffee shops before and the workers have been much more friendly. today's writing exercise was to describe an object in detail, without mentioning the object. I was writing about a car, but it's not very good so I won't post it here. I spent the rest of my time here reading, I'm almost done with my book.

They eventually booked us and when asked what time we'd be arriving they told us we would need to show up as early as 11am!! Nope! We showed up around 6:30pm and guess what? No room!!

Tsinghua,yelp-348,"Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally. Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since I love BBQ. No such luck. We had a great meal at the Windy City Barbecue, the downtown Phoenix place. For a while there, they had 3-4 different types of barbecue on the menu. Now it's a standard BBQ menu. I'm disappointed. Also, the service was atrocious. When my food was late, the waitress wouldn't tell me anything, she just took my credit card and went to get it. When I asked for my bill, she was in the back room for a long time, and when she came out, she looked me in the eye and said ""you're paying for your own dinner."" When I asked her to come to the table to explain, she told me that she had to check with the manager. I said I wanted to speak to the manager. She told me that I could speak to the manager at the front desk. I had to wait in the lobby for an hour for the manager to come out and explain why my dinner was late. The manager finally came out, apologized and said that they had been understaffed. This was the most humiliating experience of my life. The manager told me that they would send a text message to my friend, but I told him that I didn't want a text message. I wanted to talk to the manager and I wanted to talk to my friend on the phone. The manager said that he would take care of it. When I left, I told my friend that he should never eat at a Windy City Barbecue again. She's the type of person who always tries to find the positive in any situation. She took my story and ran with it. Guess what? She's on a mission to get them closed. I love Windy City Barbecue, but I'm done with them. This is the last time I will ever eat at a Windy City Barbecue. To the people who work there: get your act together. I don't want to see you guys go out of business. That's not a good thing. It's bad for the industry and it's bad for the community."

On my next trip through town will definitely try out their breakfast offerings because of how friendly helpful everyone we encountered were both during our lunch time visit or when inquiring about what menus might offer throughout restraunts hours once again..."

Nothing seemed like real BBq just over cooked and tasteless. Very Chain resturant-y, Cool memorabilia abut that's about it. They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal. I don't reccommend."

The food was pretty bland and nothing that really stood out from the rest of restaurants around PHX. Definitely not worth my money for what we got. Food quality seen only in fast food joints, even if you get the premium ones.. This is one restaurant where it's obvious no time has been spent working on food preparation or presentation"

LLAMA,yelp-348,"Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally. Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since I love BBQ. No such luck. We got there right at 5:00PM, when they opened, and was greeted by a manager who told us that they were out of ribs, and some other things (no brisket). All they had was pulled pork, chicken, beef, and pork sausage. Not the kind of selection I'd expect to find in a BBQ restaurant at 5:00PM. We were told to come back at 8:00PM when they would have more food. Not what I'd expect to hear in a restaurant that advertises BBQ. We decided to go somewhere else and were not impressed. I'm not sure if they are a BBQ place that serves Mexican food, or a Mexican place that serves BBQ, but they were not the BBQ place I'd go back to. This is my favorite bar-b-que place ever. Moved here to Phoenix area from Southern California and this place reminds me of the great BBQ in SoCal. Pulled pork is the best! Pulled pork sandwich with hot BBQ sauce on it is the best."

Human,yelp-350,"Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its fusion but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of the strongest of flavors Asian cuisine has to offer, typically the saltiest, sweetest, sourest, etc. Rarely, if ever, is it used to describe an accurate and enlightening combination of cuisines. In any case, Mainland offered exactly the fusion I'd expected. I had the crispy noodle wonton soup, which tasted great until half way through when my body knew to stop before the sodium had absorbed all the water in my body and I shriveled up. As if casino air wasn't bad enough for my hydration. Plus, I come from the SGV, so 14 for a bowl of noodles is ludicrous when I can hit up a Garden Cafe or other such spot and get a better version for 5.95. Guess I'm spoiled. My co-worker had the pork-chop, which was served in a bowl, and when she asked for a knife and fork they gave her a butter knife. ahahaha....On the up side, the wontons in my soup were pretty darn good and unlike my ghetto joints here at home, had all pork and shrimp in them."
OpenAI,yelp-350,"Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its fusion but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate I understand what you mean. When it comes to Asian cuisine, it's important to appreciate the authentic flavors and techniques used in each dish. While fusion cuisine can be exciting and creative, it's important to recognize and respect the traditional techniques and ingredients. That being said, if someone is new to Asian cuisine, Mainland can be a good introduction to some Asian flavors and ingredients. However, it's always recommended to try authentic Asian restaurants to fully appreciate the cultural heritage and diversity of Asian cuisine."
PaLM,yelp-350,"Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its fusion but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of mediocre dishes from various Asian countries rather than a harmonious blend. The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone, but none of the dishes really stood out. The service was friendly and attentive, but the food was just average. I started with the wonton soup, which was bland and tasteless. The wontons were small and dry, and the broth was watery and had no flavor. For my main course, I had the pad thai, which was also disappointing. The noodles were overcooked and mushy, and the sauce was too sweet and sour. The vegetables were undercooked and bland, and the tofu was dry and tasteless. The only dish that I enjoyed was the Mongolian beef, which was tender and flavorful. The beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. However, the portion was small and the price was high. Overall, I was not impressed with Mainland. The food was mediocre and the prices were high. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for good Asian food.

I understand its fusion but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of Asian cuisines with no regard to taste. There are other examples but I don't want to start a flame war. I've had this place a few times and every time I've been disappointed. I think the food is fine, but it's all so... generic. I've had fried chicken and the rice is bland and underseasoned. I've had beef curry and the sauce is bland and the curry powder is so-so. I've had sweet and sour pork and it was bland. I've had chow mein and the noodles were bland.

I asked for a table with a window and I was given a table with a giant pane of glass in the middle. The waitress was slow to respond to my orders and when she did, she didn't have the right ingredients. I've never had this happen at any other place in the city. And the food was bland. I don't understand why they keep getting good reviews. It's just so... bland. I haven't had the right dish yet. And I don't know what it's supposed to taste like. They're missing the point.

BigScience,yelp-350,"Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is.

LLAMA,yelp-350,"Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its fusion but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of whatever cheap and available ingredients are thrown together to create something sort of tasty. I've been to the one in Kaka'ako and found it to be mediocre at best. I guess I can say that its more of a fast food option if you're in a hurry and need some nourishment but as for the quality of the food, its really not something I would go out of my way for. I'm not sure why the one in Kaka'ako is so popular and has such great reviews. Maybe its for people who are new to the islands or don't have a good grasp of the area. If you want to stay in Kaka'ako and eat something, then this is probably your best bet. I don't have anything against the place, its just that I don't find it worthy of all the hype. If you're going to make a trip into Kaka'ako, there are a lot of other places to eat that are so much better."
PaLM,yelp-351,"I love Rosati's, and I've ordered from this store dozens of times. The staff is friendly and the pizza is awesome. We usually get either the thin crust or the deep dish, but they also have a great selection of salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes. One of my favorite things about Rosati's is that they offer a variety of toppings. You can choose from everything from pepperoni and sausage to mushrooms, olives, and pineapple. They also have a great selection of specialty pizzas, like the Chicago Classic with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers; the Hawaiian with ham, pineapple, and cheese; and the Meat Lover's with pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, and beef. No matter what you're in the mood for, Rosati's is sure to have something you'll love. And with their quick and friendly service, you'll be able to enjoy your meal in no time. Here are some of the things I love about Rosati's:  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The pizza is delicious and made with fresh ingredients.  The menu has a wide variety of options to choose from.  The prices are reasonable.  The service is quick and efficient. If you're looking for a great pizza place, I highly recommend Rosati's. You won't be disappointed. Here are some additional details about Rosati's:  Rosati's was founded in 1943 by Rudy Rosati.  The first Rosati's restaurant was located in Chicago, Illinois.  Rosati's now has over 200 locations across the United States.  Rosati's is known for its thin crust pizza.  Rosati's also offers a variety of salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes.  Rosati's is a family-friendly restaurant. If you're ever in the mood for a delicious pizza, be sure to check out Rosati's. You won't be disappointed."
Human,yelp-351,"I love Rosati's, and I've ordered from this store dozens of times. The staff is friendly and the pizza is awesome. We usually get either the thin crust or the Chicago style. So why only 2 stars? A couple of weeks ago we ordered a thin with cheese and a Chicago with pepperoni. I go pick it up, take it home only to find that the Chicago pizza's crust was severly undercooked. It was very obvious just by looking at it. Of course we tried to eat some but it was really bad. I call the store back and tell them, they offer to make another one. Come pick it up in 20 minutes. I drive back to the store and the manager (I think) is sitting out front and asks me why I'm back so soon. I tell her the pizza was not cooked. She makes some comment oh really?!? or something but never gets up from her chair. The kid working the counter brings out my new pizza and we open both the new and the old boxes to compare. It was very obvious that the original pizza was undercooked when comparing the 2. So my take on it is that they KNEW the pizza was bad and figured they could serve it to me and I wouldn't notice or complain OR the person cooking the pizzas is blind andor doesn't care whether the pizza is good or not. Either way, this is uncacceptable! And to make matters worse. All I got was a half-hearted lame apology from the counter kid. Not that I was expecting them to give me the pizza for free but come on! No coupon, no offer of any compensation whatsoever. Lame! Especially when spending almost 30 for 2 pizzas. But whatever, I might go back because I really do like the pizza but I think they need to step up thier game in the service department."

As a lot of people have mentioned, the location is amazing, being right on the lake, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. There's a lovely bar area, and the breakfast is pretty good, too. Overall, I'd definitely recommend staying at the Edgewater."
BigScience,yelp-353,"The Edgewater's rooms are really lovely. The room I stayed in was overly spacious, with a deliciously comfortable bed, and a really nice view of the lake. As a lot of people said before me (and I'm sure this is true), there were no problems with noise at all from outside or inside - it's one thing to be on Yonge Street but quite another being so close to it. Also as others mentioned, you can hear trains passing next door. I liked that they had free breakfast available for guests, although if you're looking for something more traditional like eggs sausage rolls bacon sarnies etc., then I'd recommend booking into another hotel that's closer to downtown Toronto. Through our accessories department we offer two different packaging systems for your EGGY products complete packs ready-to-use:"

OpenAI,yelp-353,"The Edgewater's rooms are really lovely. The room I stayed in was overly spacious, with a deliciously comfortable bed, and a really nice view of the lake. As a lot of the rooms have balconies, it's a great place to sit outside, relax, and take in the views. The amenities in the room were also great, with a large flat-screen TV, plenty of storage space, and a nice bathroom with a powerful shower. In addition to the rooms, the hotel itself has a lot to offer. There are multiple restaurants and bars, a fitness center, a spa, and even a movie theater. The location is also great, as it's right on the edge of Lake Michigan and close to a lot of great attractions in downtown Madison. Overall, I would highly recommend The Edgewater to anyone looking for a comfortable and luxurious stay in Madison."
Tsinghua,yelp-353,"The Edgewater's rooms are really lovely. The room I stayed in was overly spacious, with a deliciously comfortable bed, and a really nice view of the lake. As a lot of people do, I skipped breakfast at the hotel and grabbed a nice, hearty breakfast at a local restaurant. It was an easy 20 minute walk to the ferry terminal, and 30 minutes to downtown via the A-line. If you're looking for a nice, relaxing weekend, this is the place for you. There are many nice shops and restaurants in the area, and the Harbor Walk is right across the street. The only downsides to this hotel are the noise from the marina and the fact that the parking is extremely limited. In order to park anywhere in the neighborhood, you'll have to go to the lot across the street from the hotel, which is about a 10 minute walk. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. Did you?

LLAMA,yelp-354,"Where do you go when your washer and dryer break down? How about Starcrest, which can boast it's own little study room with two desks, four chairs, and free wi-fi? It's also got a little cafe that sells sandwiches, soups, beer, and wine. If it was open on Sunday, it would be the perfect place to sit down and do some reading for my classes. There are several other places in Davis that claim to have free wi-fi, but so far, this place is the only one I've found that's actually open on a Sunday. The only downside is that it's a bit far away from home. The other week, we received the following email from the department: ""Dear Colleague: In my effort to be more effective, I am sending this email to those of you who have graduate students. In the past, I have not done this as I thought the student would be the one to follow up with you regarding their progress. Unfortunately, many do not. I have also not sent this to those of you who have only recently started to advise graduate students. This is a new effort to increase my effectiveness. I am planning to meet with each of our graduate students in the near future. I will be asking them about their progress towards their degree, their plans for the future and any problems they might be having. I would like to know what you think of their progress as well. Please send me your feedback on the student's progress, their likelihood of completing the degree requirements within the timeframe that they have presented to me, and any problems you might be having with the student. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact me. Thanks for your time and help in this effort."" I'm sure he means well. But I'm also sure that this is not the way to go about it. We had a graduate student, A, whose committee chair was very similar. His typical emails, whenever the student was having problems, would go something like this: ""Dear student A: I just talked with Dr. X, and I understand that you are having trouble with your research. I'm very concerned about your progress. This is my last year on campus before I go on sabbatical, and I would like to see you graduate before I leave. I have a reputation to uphold. Please get your act together. Sincerely, Dr. L"" Within the course of one year, student A had developed severe paranoia, acute depression, and had to drop out of the program. Student A had never had problems before Dr. L became his committee chair. He's currently on medication and working on getting his life back in order. Dr. L, on the other hand, got his reputation intact, because he graduated a student before he went on sabbatical. I can't be sure, but I have a feeling that our current chair is trying to follow in Dr. L's footsteps. I can't help but wonder if our current chair has ever heard of the expression, ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff."" I have been a graduate student for the past seven years. I have had to deal with various levels of incompetence, indifference, and, on occasion, outright hostility on the part of my committee members. I have been at this for seven years now. If I'm not ""ready to graduate,"" then that is the fault of my committee, and no amount of emails from the committee chair is going to change that. I'm not going to write my committee chair an email, telling him that if he wants to see me graduate, then he needs to get his act together. I'm not going to tell him that if he wants to see me graduate, then he needs to become a better mentor. I'm not going to tell him that if he wants to see me graduate, then he needs to stop being such a pompous ass. I'm not going to tell him that if he wants to see me graduate, then he needs to stop insulting my intelligence. I'm not going to tell him that if he wants to see me graduate, then he needs to stop treating me like a child. I'm not going to tell him that if he wants to see me graduate, then he needs to stop being such a pathetic excuse of a human being. Because I'm a graduate student, and he's the committee chair. But I'm sure that he will understand."

I like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors. And no, that's not racist. The washers are expensiveat least by my standards1.50 a wash, but they fit in more than your average washer. Dryers are about 25 centers per 7 minutes, but are HUMONGONORMOUS, so all told, washing two loads of laundry came to 3 in washing and 1.75 in drying (all of it fit in that one dryer and I let it run for 49 mins). The laundromat is clean and big, so that's a plus. Also, the wi-fi network....is named Chuck likes Guys Um, wow Chuck. Thanks for letting us all know via internet. We're very happy for you.

I'm just an AI language model, so I don't actually go anywhere. However, if you're asking where you could go to get your washer and dryer fixed, you could try contacting the manufacturer for repair or maintenance services. Additionally, you can look for local appliance repair businesses. As for Starcrest, it sounds like a great place to take advantage of their study room and free Wi-Fi while you wait for your appliances to be fixed."

I went over to my little sister's house for a visit this morning and we found our neighbor's cat had died in her yard last night. We didn't know what happened until it was too late (the vet wasn't there) but he wouldn't go near anyone or anything so they put him down."
Human,yelp-356,"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery. No. Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived. It made her just as happy. She and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair. The fabric was not inexpensive. Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less. However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process. And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there. My parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator. Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building. They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator. That is such great customer service it is ridiculous. It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment. This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so. They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back. These are the kinds of things that make a big difference."

LLAMA,yelp-358,"Very fun place! Vegan ice cream is such a novel idea, and they do it well. I had the chai tiramisu tSoynami and my sister had the almond oy vey. The tSoynami was very delicious - the chai flavor was just right, and it was very smooth and creamy. The oy vey was also very good, though the almond flavor wasn't very strong. We also got the very berry hot chocolate, which was amazing. I don't know how they got it so hot (it was probably nearly boiling) and yet had such a strong and wonderful chocolate flavor. It's a very small place with only a few tables, so if you're going for the ice cream, it's probably best to take it to go. I don't know if they make their own ice cream or not, but it's definitely not the kind you'd get in a supermarket or a chain ice cream store. It's very creamy and light, though I'm not sure how many calories it has. They do have a bunch of toppings you can add on your ice cream, but I didn't try any of them. I'm not sure if you have to pay extra for the toppings or not. They are a completely vegan establishment, with the only exception being the very berry hot chocolate, which has a small amount of honey in it. They also do not sell any products with gluten in them. If you have any questions, the woman who works there is very friendly and helpful."

Go to a smaller bar and get a better draft beer for a lot less money. Come on people, you don't have to spend 10-15 for a beer to have a good time. 8 for a Stone IPA???? Seriously? I'll pass.

Go to a local bar and get a nice craft beer for 5.00 or so. Or try to make friends with a bartender, and they can hook you up. Go out to dinner with friends, or a movie. Those are the options you have, and you have to stop making excuses. It's a shame. And to the OP, 100 is a lot of money to spend on beer. I just can't get it. You can get a 6 pack for 15.00 or less. Or 3 packs for 10.00. 4 beers for 10.00 is a lot of beer. If you are going to go out, spend your money on food and drinks that are worth it. You don't need to spend 100 on a night out. I'm guessing the 100 you are spending is on beer, not food. That's a lot of beer, and the drinks are expensive for a place like that. I just don't get it. I don't drink that much anymore.

OpenAI,yelp-359,"I just hopped on their website to look at their beer selection. 8 for a draft of Stone IPA???? Seriously? I'll pass. It's understandable that you may not want to pay that much for a draft. Perhaps you can look for other bars or restaurants in the area that offer lower prices for the same beer, or try exploring different beer options at the same establishment. Let me know if you need any help finding other places in the area."

LLAMA,yelp-361,"Okay, the Hot and Ready deal is a joke. They never have the 5 pizzas ready, and there is always a wait. To top it off, the last three times, they have been missing ingredients from my pizza. I understand that mistakes happen, but they need to get their act together. I took a second job and get off work at 5 AM. I always stop by this place to get pizza for me and my two year old son. I am never disappointed. We stop in at least 3 times a week and I have never had a bad experience. I love the employees there. They are always friendly and have a smile. The pizza is always great. I have to admit I'm a bit addicted to the cheese bread. This is the best pizza joint in town. Great pizza and the best breadsticks in town. The new manager is such a great guy! Quick, cheap, and good. Hot and ready pizzas are a good deal and the price is right. Only downside is if you don't like pepperoni then you are out of luck. I go to this Little Caesars about 3-4 times a week, and the employees are always friendly and super polite. I love the pizza and breadsticks, and I love the new manager. This Little Caesars is hands down the best Little Caesars I've ever been to. Greatest pizza I've ever had! My family loves the pizza and bread sticks! I went through the drive thru tonight and I was disappointed. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and when I got home there were only 8 pieces and I ordered 2 sides of ranch and the drive thru girl only put 1 in the bag. They need to train the staff better. I will not be going back for a long time. I've been going to this Little Caesars for years. I never had a problem with the service or the pizza.

They just closed down? Isn't that sad?! Hmmm...the southern part of SC has some great eateries too!! Have fun exploring The hot sauce one will most definitely need to be added soon as well!!! We had two other places close recently (like 3 or 4 months ago) but it's been crazy busy lately..hopefully that's because people realized what's out there!!

BigScience,yelp-362,"Disappointing. Although the choices were plentiful, the hot food was cold and too greasy. The customer service at my table made me feel like I had been uninvited to a family picnic. The menu says it all: there are more than 100 different types of omelettes here! You can go with classic flavours such as beef and cheese or try something exotic with, for example lemon cheeseburger flavour omelette... If you prick your fingers on this one you'll never be able to get them out again... Many restaurants have become so popular that they actually start planning their menus around what people want - but that's not always true in our case. We don't advertise or put up posters about any specials, because we just know it's going to turn into an incredibly crowded place! So far we've only visited Muggles for breakfast (we've also tried some other things), although when we're next in town we'll definitely give lunch another chance! One day I'll visit the restaurant solo and order 2 omelettes each time. There won't even be someone else around to mess us both up I really need to make sure I'm eating outside at least once a weekend if I'm ever royalty, haha! My favourite is orange chicken- an omelet that's spread with sliced avocado and diced tomatoes and cooked over low heat until the egg is cooked through while keeping most of its moisture intact. Very yummy. Hi Nagae, thanks for mentioning Muggles. It looks like they're doing OK with no celebrity chefs for now though? I've heard rumors that they plan to add celebrities soon. Oh wow, sounds delicious. Right now I am crazy excited by Alex's Yakiniku restaurant chain. They do have two branches here in Tokyo. Last week I ate a Japanese BBQ dish called sashimi rice ball which sounded kind of weird but tasted amazing:)"

The salad was cold, the steak was tough, the potatoes were overcooked, the butter sauce was just butter and the asparagus was dry. The kids' meal was served with a glass of water and no entree.

The food is always good but the waiters are terrible. I have tried to order 2 times and I was just told the server was too busy to take my order. When we finally did get the food it was just average.

The pasta was very cold and the flavor was very bland. We did not even eat the food. I will not be eating at the Olive Garden again. The food was mediocre at best. The portion size was small.

I asked for delivery between 12:00 and 12:30 and didn't get my food until 1:30. The driver was also very rude when I asked for a refund for the delivery fee. I was impressed that my order was ready in less than 15 minutes! I was starving, so that was a major plus. The food is delicious, and the people are very nice. Not enough sauce in the shrimp fried rice. Our food was very good. I ordered the General Tso Chicken and the Chicken w Broccoli. They were both very good. The General Tso was a bit on the sweet side but still very good. My only complaint is that we waited a long time for our food. It was worth the wait but I wish it would have been ready a little faster. I will order again but next time I will call in my order and pick it up. Great food and service, a little slow on delivery.

We would definitely recommend this place for a casual dinner or a drink with friends."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-364,"We went here for dinner as the sun was setting. We sat outside against the rail and had a pretty decent view of the strip as the lights were just beginning to come on, so we could watch it all go down without missing much! The food (mains 20-25) is quite good - plenty fo options available each night: steaksribs etc or you can get something lighter like chicken fajitas with rice beans (8). The service isn't bad either although there are some people that obviously don' t know what they're doing when serving drinks...and I mean this in every sense from pouring your drink into another glass if asked politely not forcefully putting ice cream over top someone's dessert...etc There really wasn't anything wrong but those small touches made almost everything else seem fine:) Overall though by far one our favorite places out town!! Would recommend!!!Read more"
Tsinghua,yelp-364,We went here for dinner as the sun was setting. We sat outside against the rail and had a pretty decent view of the strip as the lights were just coming on. The service was good and the food was pretty good. My husband had the blackened grouper and I had the steak. We had the steak medium rare and I had a side of broccoli. The service was very good and the food was good.
BigScience,yelp-364,"We went here for dinner as the sun was setting. We sat outside against the rail and had a pretty decent view of the strip as the lights were just starting to get switched on. This is one of those restaurants that has been featured in some travel magazines, so we decided to try it out when we wanted something different from the usual steakhouses or Italian places around town (yes I know there are plenty!!). The food at Bistro du Soleil couldn't be described as sexy - it's not really fancy but it's delicious! The menu focuses mainly on French cuisine with an occasional Mediterranean twist. I tried their signature escargot dish which tasted like heaven - they have a beautiful presentation too! Practically everyone who's visited Vegas seems to love Circus Maximus, even if you don't think you've got enough money for another trip. It's certainly worth checking this most upmarket hotel out before heading off into town (check prices)."
LLAMA,yelp-364,"We went here for dinner as the sun was setting. We sat outside against the rail and had a pretty decent view of the strip as the lights were just starting to turn on. We were on the third floor, and my husband thought that the buffet was pretty good. He said that it was better than some of the buffets in Vegas. He also said that the price was not bad. I thought that the place was great, but I did not like the fact that there were so many people smoking. I know that it is legal, but I wish they would have had a non-smoking section. All in all, we had a great dinner."
Human,yelp-364,"We went here for dinner as the sun was setting. We sat outside against the rail and had a pretty decent view of the strip as the lights were just starting to come on. I got the delicious shrimp heaven dish and I must of gotten and 30 shrimp (coconut, fried, tempura battered, shrimp cocktail, and fries) I especially loved the coconut shrimp. We ordered the lava flow drinks in fun light up glasses which made for some fun pictures. Very good drinks, but way overpriced. The waitress even asked us some Forest Gump Trivia which just added to the experience. It's right next to the balcony of the goretorium bar and we saw some zombies taking a smoke break! Great time!"
Human,yelp-365,They have a decent menu and really good prices. You do get a decent amount of food for the price that you pay. The Fried Ice Cream is the best that I have had in my opinion!

BigScience,yelp-365,"They have a decent menu and really good prices. You do get a decent amount of food for the price that you pay. The Fried Ice Cream is the best ice cream I've had in quite some time. This was my first visit to this place, I got a few dishes there along with our drinks (The Long Island iced tea Orange Soda), we ordered it all together as well since they were on sale..the first thing we tried out,was their Baked Beef Sliders (I think that's what it's called) those are pretty darn yummy! They come up freshly baked from the oven and filled with delicious shredded beef thats also seasoned wonderfully...i almost didn't want more but decided i would just try one piece after another..all served very hot because its cooked at high heat inside every single slider so it comes piping hot upon order. Other than that we couldn't decide which dish to go for next, when i asked them if they could let me taste everything before ordering anything else i said yes they did...and now I'm sitting here craving to try other items like fries or even their specialty dishes.. But thank goodness for the ""special"" offers - one per person unless otherwise specified - available between sundays and tuesdays only: We love this restaurant and we've been coming back many times over the years. We always stop by on Thursday nights prior to going bowling since that night will be free pizza..Luke's Pizza has a great selection of pizzas including 5 cheese pepperoni which is the most popular choice! Everybody needs a place like Luke's Pizza where they can bring in friends, family or clients without stressing about making sure everyone gets something on their plates....it's hard enough finding places around town that offer decent pizza these days especially ones that don't cost any kind of fortune..there aren't too many options so we definitely appreciate being able to eat at one that does"

This was our first time at this restaurant, and we were pleasantly surprised! We came for the karaoke, and stayed for the food. The waiter was very friendly, and was very accommodating.

Our waiter only came to the table one time and that was when we sat down. We had to look for the waiter when we needed something. My husband had to go to the kitchen to get something that should have been at the table. Food was excellent! The place has changed since the last time we were there, so we were pleasantly surprised. The food was great! Service not so much. The waiter never came back to check on us. I had a coupon for a free entree for my birthday. But, when we got there, the coupon had expired. The waiter said that he would take care of it and make sure I got the free meal. But, when the bill came, the coupon was not taken off. When we brought it to the attention of the waiter, he said that he had told someone about it and that he was not responsible for the bill. He said that he was only responsible for the food. I told him that he was not only responsible for the food, but also the service. We had to go back to the hostess to get it taken care of. The waiter then took the coupon to get it fixed. But, I had to go back to the hostess to get the coupon back, because the waiter didn't bring it back to us. The waiter was very unprofessional. I will never go back to this restaurant again. Got the Hibachi Chicken and it was delicious. Had a really good flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The service was quick and very courteous. Excellent food, and very nice waitress.

The Elk course I had by itself cost 50 or so for 3 pieces with a glass apiece (I think), but when adding all my drinks it came out near 20 more than that (65). The beer they served on tap wasn't what we expected at any price - never heard anyone say ""Wow"" about our selection here before today...the same old mediocre stuff you can buy anywhere else cheaper anyway! They only have one bartender working during peak hours? So are these guys just not motivated enough because everyone knows how cheap everything will be after putting up prices 5-10 years ago?! Very strange since this place has been around forever!! And why would someone choose them over many others who offer better beersprices right across town?? Not worth going back even if doors were open later tonight....it's hard being loyal sometimes though!!!"

They didn't have the food we ordered and they had to be reminded twice to get our drinks. We were actually about to walk out but we got the food we ordered and they gave us two free desserts. After having great food at the downtown location we were looking forward to this one being just as good. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. We ordered the mussels and an Italian sausage pizza. The mussels were ok, but the pizza was bland. We came here for lunch. The service was great. We had the salmon and it was delicious. We would definitely come back. Service was excellent, we were greeted by a friendly waitress who was very attentive. Food was very good, my pork chop was tender and juicy and the sauce was very tasty.

Michigan has been an amazing states in so many ways - there's also Michigan based food truck creators who have done well. These are some of our favourites: The Ben Jerry's Barrelhouse takes ingredients from both their ice cream shop and bar. The dishes come packed full of flavour making each bite even more enjoyable. This hearty brunch menu includes croissant pancakes filled with maple syrup; bacon, sausage, ham, eggs or hash browns; smashed potatoes, homemade gravy; banana bread; cinnamon pecan muffins; blueberry oatmeal raisin parfaits and avocado toast.

BigScience,yelp-368,"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess stopped by to let us know that it would take longer than expected if we were there more than half an hour prior. The place is pretty small (we only had one table), but it's neatly decorated with really cool artwork of characters from popular media in Japan - manga, anime and comics. It also has several video games consoles available which makes me think they are dedicated fans or something! You can choose either between their'regular' menu and their 'lunch specials'. All dishes cost JPY3200 each, unless otherwise stated, so you're looking at around USD6 per dish. We ordered 3 courses each plus 2 beverages: A side order of rice, noodles and vegetables cost JPY1200 while drinks like tea, coffee etc costs JPY700-750, depending on what you have chosen."

They were both good, but I had to go back to the restaurant once more to eat my dessert, the vanilla creme brulee. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area, and you're a fan of goat cheese. It was very, very good. Saturday, October 27, 2012 As promised, I have the link to my next photo contest.

Friday, October 26, 2012 If you are looking for a fun Halloween decoration, you might want to check out the following. I was talking to a friend about the pumpkins I saw in the window of a store. She said that she saw them the other day at the hardware store and that they were really cool. She also mentioned that she saw some really cool decorative pumpkins at a home decor store. I was looking online and found that you can find pumpkins that are decorated to look like a door, a table, a chair, and even a cow. These pumpkins are 100 natural, not painted. If you are looking for something different to add to your Halloween decor, these are the perfect pumpkins. I think they are so creative. I will be adding some to my Halloween decor. Thursday, October 25, 2012 There is a movie that was released a few weeks ago that I just had to watch. I know that some of you are familiar with the movie, but if you're not, I hope you'll check it out. The movie is called ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" I had the opportunity to attend a screening of the movie and I loved it. The movie is based on the book ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" I'm not sure if it's based on the book, but it's very similar to the book. The movie is set 20 years after the events of the book. The main characters are named Caesar, the apes and the humans. Caesar is the leader of the apes. He's a good leader. The apes are smart and they are capable of many things that humans are not. The apes also have the ability to think like humans. I'm sure that's why the humans are afraid of them. Caesar was created by the humans. The apes believe that he is God. He is a good leader, but he is also very strong. The apes believe that he will return to help them. They are afraid that he will come back to kill them. They are also afraid that he will take them away from the humans. The humans are afraid that the apes will take over their planet. The movie was very good. It was action packed. I was happy to see the apes. I also enjoyed seeing the different apes. The movie was great. I'm glad that I watched it. Wednesday, October 24, 2012 I'm not a huge fan of pumpkins. I do like them, but I don't love them. They're just not my favorite vegetable. I don't think that they're ugly, but I just don't love them. I do love my pumpkins that I've grown myself, but they're not as good as store bought. I love my pumpkins, but I'm not a fan of pumpkins as a decoration. I've seen some great pumpkins in the window of a store. I was curious what they were, so I took a picture. I didn't know what they were, so I had to look them up. They are called ceramic pumpkins. They are so creative. I was wondering how they were made. I found out that they are made by a company called Pumpkinizer. They are 45.00 each."

I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I have been to this restaurant several times and have always had a good meal. I've had the fish tacos, the enchiladas and the chipotle chicken sandwich and they were all very good. The last time I went, I had the vegetable enchiladas, which were very good. This restaurant is a little bit pricey, but I think it's worth it. I think the service is a little bit slow, but it's not terrible. They are always very friendly and attentive.

OpenAI,yelp-369,Glad we stopped by. Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention. I 'm glad to hear that! Can I assist you with anything else or provide any recommendations for places to visit or restaurants to try in the area?
Human,yelp-369,Glad we stopped by. Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention.

Overall great experience and will surely return to try your their lunch menu.
Tsinghua,yelp-369,"Glad we stopped by. Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention. I really enjoyed my steak and the chicken dish was delicious. The dessert was not as good as the other dishes. They were out of some of the items I ordered. The food was great! I was disappointed that the meal was not a complete menu. It was hard to tell if a steak had mushrooms or not, or if the chicken had olives or not. But the food was delicious. My daughter said she had a ""disappointment."" I was very happy with the food and service. My boyfriend had a fantastic meal. He was a little disappointed with the portion sizes though. I had a steak and shrimp. I was happy with my meal and the service was very good. This is a nice place to eat. It is hard to find something good in the city. It was a good value. The restaurant was clean and the service was great. The staff was very friendly and polite. I had a delicious meal. The portions were large and I felt full. The only thing I didn't like was the price. We ordered the appetizer and it was not appetizing at all. We ordered the prime rib which was too much food for one person. It was a nice sized portion but it was pretty fatty. I would not order it again. The portion sizes are too small. There were too many left overs. We had a large party and the portions were small. The waitress brought out a bowl of salad but it was not served in a bowl. We had to cut it up to eat it. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this place. The food was really good. The portions were huge. I ordered the shrimp and they were delicious. The service was great. The waitress was very nice and was very attentive. I would definitely come back. I was disappointed in the price. It was a little high for the quality of the food. I would have preferred the steak and shrimp over the Prime Rib. The prime rib was a little fatty.

BigScience,yelp-369,"Glad we stopped by. Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention. I think the food was just fine as well. The chicken house is good quality with not overly sweet or spicy flavor. So yummy! New to AMC but will be back again for sure! Great place near Market Place, perfect when you are in town visiting familyfriends. Good portions and prices reasonable. I would definitely come here again if I'm ever going through Dallas. It's cheap but tasty fast service staff were friendly This restaurant serves my favorite Thai dishesso much so that I have been coming here every few weeks since moving into our neighborhood (just off W. Olive). Aside from their excellent fried rice bowl which came out hot and fragrant on each visit, they also offer a variety of other items including Pad See Ew, Cha Cae Mai, BBQ Pork Belly, chow fun, beef noodle soup,...and more. These dishes all taste really fresh and satisfying. The price point isn't bad either considering how many different options there are most nights it's about 15 per person without drinks. On some days though I've had it go up to 20 depending upon what else they decide to add onto your dish (es) andor whether they're running down specials. For example, one day they brought 3 bottles of wine with our order and charged us only 7 per bottle. My husband ordered one appetizer while he waited because he didn't want to wait too long for his main course - and then found himself paying 13 just because he wanted a drink before being seated. Overall I'd say this place is worth a trip when you're craving authentic Thai cuisine; even better yet, don't forget to ask them about their Sunday brunch buffet during their lunch hours:) We live outside Fort Worth TX...the closest grocery store is 2 miles away..it has never made sense to buy frozen foods unless we plan ahead like 6 months at least. And Time is money!! This week we went looking for something new to make dinner..we saw the Chicken House sign..noticed they had banquets...went inside....heated up a big pan..my cousin said she'd take care of the payment! We ate one wonderful meal..a bit expensive but totally worth it.....taste amazing.....thank You..... Love this place!!! They serve delicious handmade soups stir-frys. Staff is super helpful knowledgeable. Also love that this is an LGBT-owned business!! The chicken house offers a wide selection of Asian inspired meals such as pad thai, beef curry, nacho, etc. All prepared with authentic flavors and ingredients. Drinks include beerwinedessert cocktails and a full bar."

We will definitely be coming back again.

OpenAI,yelp-370,"OMG! I see tall hot Asian guy! Let's follow him! OKKKKK!!! Go talk to him. He looks like he'll dance. No. I'm scared... Out of all the guys there, we should approach the one who we feel the most comfortable with. If you are feeling scared, it may be best to not approach him. It's important to always prioritize our safety and comfort. Instead, we could try to make eye contact and smile to show our interest, and see if he approaches us. Or, we could strike up a conversation with someone nearby and potentially make some new friends who could introduce us to him later on. Remember to always trust your instincts and prioritize your well-being in social situations."

(This place is a lot less crowded than Tao and the music is just as good, with 3 seperate rooms for the folks with different taste. The main dance floor is mainstream hiphop and a bit of house mix. A few repeats here and there, but it got me goin. Every so often, the cocktails waitresses will walk by with mixed shots for free. Free, meaning take a shot for a tip. I think that's clever and a lot cheaper than buying at the bar. The shots are usually girly drinks though, like Sex On The Beach or Hurricanes. Oh, and did anyone call for a stripper pole??

What are these girls doing when noone speaks English for instance?? Are those 2 always together too?? Is anyone trying on bikinis as well? Or putting lotion by themselves etc.?

No wonder he was standing there by himself. He's probably thinking: ""OMG. Who are these two women following me?"" Ka-BOOM!!! There goes the fuse! I'm so glad I don't have a girlfriend. Sometimes I think the grass is greener on the other side. However, I don't need the extra drama. I'm sure you're the same way. We've all heard about the world-famous ""girlfriend test."" I know that's the first thing that comes to your mind. Not me. I'm the one who just wants to dance. But then, a little bit of me wants a girlfriend. Not for now. But maybe in a couple years. That's just about the time frame I've always had. But I've done it too early before. Not good. Just so you know, I'm not the jealous type. Not the least bit. I'm always happy for you. But I really hate it when you cry. I've seen too much of that, and I can't take it. I want to take you in my arms, but that's only going to make you cry even more. I'll just sit here and be quiet. Oh yes, I've been in that position before. That's why I'm so good at listening. I'm going to be the best listener you've ever had. I'm always going to be there for you. I'm just going to be a really good friend. That's the only thing I can promise. I wish I could give you the world, but I can't. I want to. I really do. But I just can't. So, what do you say? Can we be good friends? I've always been a good friend. That's all I can be. I've got nothing to give. But what I can give you is a whole lot of attention. You'll feel so good. I promise. I'm going to give you the best hugs you've ever had. When you're down, I'm going to be the first one to cheer you up. I'm going to make you smile, laugh, and dance. No one can do that better than me. But I'm not going to give you love. I can't. I'm not ready. I've been in that position before, and I'm not going to be there again. You'll have to find someone else. You'll have to be with someone else. I can't. I'm sorry. But I'm going to be the best friend you've ever had. You won't find that anywhere else. I promise you that. I'm going to give you the best attention. I'm going to give you the best care. I'm going to give you the best hugs. I'm going to give you the best dancing. I'm going to give you the best everything. But just not love. I can't. I can't give you the best. I'm sorry. But I'm going to do my best to be the best friend. That's the most I can give. I can't give you my love. That's not a good thing. Because I don't love you. I don't even know you. That's why I can't give you my love. I don't know how. I've never loved before. I've only been in love once. And I never want to be in that position again. I can't give you my heart. You'll break it. You'll break it into so many little pieces. And I'll never be able to put it back together. I'll never be able to find the pieces. I'll never be able to glue it back together. I'm sorry. I just can't give you my heart. I don't have a heart. I'm just a robot. I'm just a mechanical man. I'm just a machine. You won't be able to feel my heartbeat. It's just an artificial pulse. It's just an artificial heart. I've tried to give my heart to someone before. But she just broke it. I can't do it again. That's why I'm going"

My husband had steak - yummy- but he couldn't eat any mashed potatoes or gravy because his cholesterol levels are too high due from heart surgery years ago which caused him not be able ever digest starches again since then...so sad: (But everything else looked so delish that i tried some for myself also.....they make their salsa fresh right there every day you can ask them what kind off veggies went into making this one:) Sometimes isn;t always good if u donapos know exactly how long before hand....but we really liked ours here..and best flavor around town hands down......the bread pudding sounded like something only grandma makes lol:) olive oil cake wchocolate ganache came highly recommended by our server.

First up was our starter - Crab cakes salsa verde. There are 3 styles: crab cake only, mixed salad, or both together for 9 each. They came in twos that had 4 crabs per piece. Casey's are always fresh so they didn't disappoint us!! This item alone would have been worth ordering an entire package but there wasn't too much else we wanted anyway so it worked out perfectly! Next was their main dish - Crispy fish tacos stuffed with grilled chicken breast. These delicious fajitas come loaded with shredded cabbage, tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, green beans, guacamole and sour cream. It's easy to see why these items sold such fast away from the restaurant because they're all good pieces! On top of this whole thing you get your choice of: red sauce, chipotle sauce, black bean sauce or ranch dressing."
OpenAI,yelp-371,"Where do I begin? I love Casey Moore's! What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to enhance the atmosphere. As for food, their menu is full of tasty options. I highly recommend trying their fish and chips, it's one of their signature dishes. They also have a great selection of local and craft beers, cocktails, and wine. Another popular dish is their Irish nachos, which are loaded with cheese, bacon, scallions, and jalapenos. And of course, make sure to save room for their desserts. Their bread pudding is to die for!"

Lots of beautiful decorations to match the fun and festive atmosphere. It's the perfect place to enjoy a cold beer and a burger with friends. The service is always friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the burgers, especially the Casey Moore Burger. It's a big, juicy burger with all the fixings, and it's sure to satisfy your hunger. I've also had the fish tacos, and they were fantastic. The fish was perfectly cooked and the tacos were packed with flavor. If you're looking for a great place to eat and drink, Casey Moore's is the place to go. The food is delicious, the service is great, and the atmosphere is fun and festive. You won't be disappointed! Here are some specific details about my experience at Casey Moore's:  The outside patio is spacious and has plenty of seating. There are misters to help keep you cool on hot days, and the decorations are festive and fun.  The service is friendly and attentive. Our server was quick to take our order and make sure we had everything we needed.  The food is delicious. I had the Casey Moore Burger, and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The fish tacos were also excellent.  The atmosphere is fun and festive. The music is upbeat, and the decorations are colorful and inviting. It's the perfect place to enjoy a meal with friends or family. Overall, I had a great experience at Casey Moore's. The food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.

Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly. When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets... so now you know! The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses. If you're feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone! Every time I go there I wish I was a man so I could do it."

He also ordered the meatballs and they were over-cooked and very dry. They forgot the potatoes. We were there on a Saturday and it was very crowded.

The service is horrible, the employees were not friendly and we felt that we were not even acknowledged by them. The owner must be out of his mind to have his restaurant this way. Don't go there unless you are looking for a great meal at a terrible price. Their specials are okay, but the burgers are way too greasy and they make you wait for the food. If you order a burger you have to wait an hour. Their fries are cold and the shakes are just okay. I had a couple of drinks and it was 20.00. You have to be joking.

Once we sat down and got water, it took a very long time for anyone to come over and even see if we were ready to order or had questions. Our appetizers came out and were very bland and the garlic bread was burnt. No one came by to see if everything was ok, so by the time someone did come over, our next course was out. They got us a new garlic bread, which also came out burnt. They did end up taking it off our bill. Our other food was just ok. Kind of bland and uninteresting, and definitely not worth 22!

Once we sat down I'm sorry to hear that you had a bad experience at Buddy V's. As an AI assistant, I can't change the outcome of your experience but I can offer a few suggestions on how to handle the situation with the restaurant. 1. Talk to the staff: The best way to resolve any issues with a restaurant is to talk to the staff. Let them know your concerns and give them a chance to offer a solution. 2. Leave a review: Leaving a review on their website or social media pages can help them identify the areas that need improvement. 3. Contact management: If you feel that your concerns were not addressed by the staff, you could contact the management to escalate the issue. I hope this can help you resolve the situation and improve your overall dining experiences."

LLAMA,yelp-373,"We went to Mix with a party of eight to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. While the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing, the food and service were disappointing. The service was very slow, we had to ask twice for water. Food arrived very slowly, only to be followed by other dishes. By the time everyone had their food, the first dish was cold. I have to say that the food was quite disappointing. I had the duck breast, which was tough and chewy. The sauce was not very tasty and I was left with an unpleasant after taste. The chocolate dessert was under cooked, and was more liquid than solid. My friend had the venison, which was full of fat. The wine list was very expensive. We asked for the cheapest bottle of white wine, which was 30. I would expect to pay that much for a good bottle of wine, but not for the cheapest on the menu! The bill was almost 100 a head. All in all, I think you pay a lot of money for an overrated restaurant with bad service and average food. I will not go again. Mix by Alain Ducasse is a restaurant where you can have a breathtaking view of London. It is located at the top of the Intercontinental Hotel. The food is very good. It is expensive but it is worth it. The service is impeccable. We had a very good time. I have been to Mix twice in the past month and it has been absolutely fantastic on both occasions. The food is exquisite and the service is impeccable. A magical experience. I am going back again next week! We went to mix for my wife's birthday and were very impressed. The view of London was amazing and the food was wonderful. The whole experience was very relaxing. I will be going back again soon. Above all, the food was outstanding. We went to Mix to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were helpful and attentive and the food was excellent. We had the tasting menu and I cannot fault any of the courses. We were given extra little tasters and the presentation was amazing. The wine was very good, but pricey. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend it. We went to Mix on a Sunday night and were very disappointed. The service was extremely slow. We waited for over 30 minutes to be given menus and we were not offered any water, despite asking. We had to wait a long time to be served our starters, only to be followed by the other dishes shortly afterwards. By the time everyone had their food, the first dishes were cold.

While the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing, the food and service were disappointing. The service was very slow, and while they did bring out the appetizers we ordered, we did not get our entrees until well after 11:30pm. We were also told we could not have our appetizers until we had ordered our entrees, which is pretty ridiculous. The appetizers we did get were not very good, so it was not a big deal. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was terrible. The server brought out a pitcher that was completely empty, and only filled it up with lukewarm tap water. We had to ask for a new pitcher of sangria, which was delivered in about 10 minutes. The sangria was still pretty cold by then, so we just dumped it and ordered a pitcher of white wine. The food was also disappointing. The meal was served on paper plates with paper utensils, and we were not given plates or utensils for our appetizers. The service was extremely slow and disorganized. The wait staff was not very friendly, and we did not feel like they were attentive to our needs. The food was cold, and it was hard to tell what was what. The appetizers were okay, but the entrees were not very good. The three of us who ordered chicken breast all had the same issue: the chicken breast was not cooked to our liking. One of us ordered well-done, and the other two ordered medium well. We were all unhappy with the food. We all wanted our chicken breast to be well-done, but we did not receive that. The waiter explained that it was not possible for them to cook the chicken to our liking, so he offered to bring us another dish of chicken instead. We were not happy with that, and we ended up paying for a half portion of chicken, which was still undercooked. We also ordered two drinks with our entrees, and the drinks were not on the table when we were served our entrees. The server had to ask the bartender to bring them to us, and when they did, they were extremely cold. We were not happy with this, and we ended up having to wait a while to get our drinks. The servers were not very friendly, and they were not very attentive to our needs. We did not feel like they were aware of our orders, or that they were willing to help us. Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at Mix. The restaurant was beautiful, and we had a great view, but the food and service were not very good. The prices are very high for the quality of the food and service. The food was cold, and the server was not very friendly."

This place has gorgeous architecture great views; however nothing about their menu or decor make me want to return there again! The portions are small; you order one item for dinner then another to go as dessert - not even an appetizer option. Food quality seemed good though we only had 2 courses each time which was fine.

I found myself enjoying the seasonal offerings like pumpkin spiced hot chocolate and traditional Irish coffee, often choosing more unique varieties than anything offered on the regular menu. As far back as 2012, I've been saying how much better is having your hairdresser use products free from Parabens and Sulfates instead of using chemical substances. Unfortunately many salons still don't know what they should do in terms of coloring client's hair with natural colors such as cherry blonde, light brown shades etc... In fact more frequently clients prefer to visit specialists offering artificial colored hair rather than trying new ways of achieving beautifully shaped and coloured locks without chemicals. In case you're looking for advice or tips regarding alternative solutions with no risk please read carefully, because I'm going to give you all information needed and answer questions like: So today I am happy to announce my colleague Natalia Kiseleva will present her opinion regarding salon services aimed to change colour. Natalia lives in Moscow where she works also as freelance photographer specializing in fashion photography. She studied International Relations at the Institute of Foreign Affairs since 2010. Her passion lies mainly in travel - Russia, Ukraine, Japan and Turkey being among her favorite destinations. As a filmmaker, she has created documentary films focusing primarily on social issues, especially gender equality, human rights violations within certain countries and environmental protection worldwide. The talk focuses on Natalia's own experience working as a stylist, educator and consultant for several years. She gives attention to modern methods of helping people achieve desired appearance after treatment performed at a beauty parlor, highlighting problems related to undesirable effects caused by cosmetic procedures carried out behind closed doors. At first glance these changes seem obvious due to visible results whereas more subtle physical modifications usually take longer, creating panic amongst women afraid of losing control over themselves."
Human,yelp-373,"We went to Mix with a party of eight to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. While the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing, the food and service left much to be desired. To begin with, the hostess didn't ask if we'd prefer to sit inside or outside. We ended up sitting outside...the heat and the altitude began to make us all feel nauseated. I also made the mistake of wearing heels to the restaurant...the floor of the patio was like a deck and my heel kept getting stuck in the floor. Also, every time someone walked by the table, it felt like the floor was shaking (wish I would have known to bring dramamine to dinner). When the waiter came to our table he asked if we had a show to attend. We should have said yes as this might have lead to quicker service. We ended up not ordering wine or cocktails for the table (due to the nausea), and the waiter seemed to write our table off. After we placed our food order, it took an hour for dinner to come. While the food (when it did come) wasn't terrible, it definitely wasn't worth the 90person we ended up spending. The waiter didn't come to check on us at all throughout the meal. He even spent 20 minutes flirting with some girls at the table next to us while we were waiting for our bill. When we complained to the manager at the end of the meal, he asked why we didn't come speak with him since he was outside the whole time. I don't know about your experiences, but in other restaurants, the manager usually circulates and checks on each table themselves rather than waiting for diners to come up to them. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I will definitely not be going back to Mix."

I came on a Saturday about noon, I think it would have been better if they had just posted their menu online and taken reservation instead. The decor is nice enough too. The service really disappointed me though. Seemed rushed as we were waiting in line (they hadn't even brought our drinks yet). Our table wasn't ready until after 2 hours then the staff didn't know what ever happened with my order which took maybe an hour or more to arrive because apparently she forgot someone else's order and had to get another one! We waited over half an hour for dessert and only got two little pieces due to huge crowds around us. They also left before finishing up our breakfast and probably missed other orders by not calling back anything like ""are you all done?"" Food - reasonable price versus quality served. A lot of scrambled eggs here so it's goodbye omelet bites! I ordered a classic plate of grits from there every time I'm going out. Just need to remember to go sooner rather than later when there's no reservations available. Really can't wait to try some new places.. Thanks for sharing this post.

The meal was still yummy, tomatoes were amazingly seasoned. I had to order a side of bacon because the hash seemed Bare without any meat and that one piece of salmon. My boyfriend had the hangover burger and loved it! They offer an all you can drink option of mimosa and I think it was beer? Which is awesome. We didn't get it this time, maybe next time. Ambience is great, very modern. The staff was good too, very attentive, I think the manager also came to check on us and was helping the staff with serving food which is really nice to see.

LLAMA,yelp-374,"Came for brunch, looked empty on the outside but was surprised to find that the place was full of people upon entering! I came on a Saturday about noon, I had heard from people that this place was packed, so I was surprised to find that there were only two people waiting in line. The wait was about 20-30 minutes (10-15 for me because I sat at the bar). First off, the waitress was extremely nice and attentive. I've been to places where the waitresses are rude, but this one was very nice and helpful. I came for brunch, and wanted to try their seafood. I ordered the crab scramble. The menu was not as extensive as I thought it would be, but I think that's because they focus on a few things and specialize in those. When the dish came, I was surprised to find that it was only ONE SCRAMBLED EGG! The portion was surprisingly small, the plate was full, but that was only because there was a lot of potatoes, not because there was a lot of crab! The crab was cooked well and tasted delicious, the egg was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were nicely seasoned. For 14, I think this is a bit much. I think the prices are a bit overpriced. I think a scramble should be at least 2 eggs, and maybe have an additional option to pay more for more eggs. Otherwise, I think that the quality of the food and service was very good. I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes."

Within minutes after he fixed everything (the vet said it took about 30 seconds), they sent us home again. This time they had Dr. Conroy's husband call our house-he is apparently very good friends with his wife! They came up right away, gave us all information regarding the current state of our puppy, assured us that although she might be slightly less vivacious from the anesthesia, she would recover quickly (and still be fine!) And then went back into surgery room where Daphne was getting stitched up while I talked pet-sit duty duties over with the other woman. My husband has only worked here as a support worker so far, which saves some money since he doesn't need insurance...but when you know how much these people love and care for their animals, you're willing to pay whatever it takes! For anyone considering treating your pets or doing any kind of veterinary work, DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL!! Our dogs are now both spayed neutered because we couldn't find ANYWHERE else anywhere near town that even remotely met our needs...this one especially frustrated us because it's not just spayingneutering; their sterilization service alone would cost 400 and they'd surgically remove ALL of our babies' teeth!!! No way in hell will we go through THAT!!! We lived three blocks down the street from this place, and during those years I brought them a ton of treats, water bottles, toys, blankets, clothes...and loaded bags full of potty pads; I visited often enough that I am pretty comfortable saying I'm close friends with many of the staff members; if anything happened to our cats or our chickens - which don't live quite nearby, (both are closer to the neighbor next door's yard) I'd be wondering why nobody came looking for them... But the last couple times I've called asking for help finding ""someone"" (my cat moved off the property;, they've told me things like: ""She'll probably come running tomorrow morning when she realizes she can get food clean water without having to ask"""
PaLM,yelp-375,The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced. My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone and the staff was able to safely remove it. They were extremely friendly and made sure my dog was comfortable the entire time. I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone looking for a vet.
Human,yelp-375,The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced. My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone yesterday and I rushed her there hysterical of course. They gave her immediate attention and saved her life. That let me sit with her as she woke up from sedation and also stayed with us as she came to. Dr.Isom was right by our side and couldn't have been more comforting through my hysterical crying. After all was said and done I returned home so grateful with my girl Jazzy. Thank you Indian Bend
Tsinghua,yelp-375,"The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced. My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone and I called them right away. I was told they would be there in 15 minutes. They arrived within 5 minutes and made the most incredible decision. They took him to surgery immediately and had him out in under 15 minutes. They took such great care and explained everything to me in detail. They even gave me a map of the facility so I would know where everything was. I highly recommend them. My dog has lived with the same vet for 15 years. She has never had an issue. They are the best. I am a retired military man and can not tell you how good the staff is. They have a special care for my dog. I am very happy with the vet. It is nice to go there and not be worried about the dog.

My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone I'm so sorry to hear that your dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone! That sounds like a scary situation. I'm glad to hear that the doctors and techs at the hospital have been caring and compassionate. It's so important to have a team of professionals who are knowledgeable and empathetic in situations like this. I hope your dog makes a full recovery soon!
LLAMA,yelp-375,The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced. My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone and I was terrified. My regular vet couldn't see her for 4 days. They were able to get us in right away. We saw Dr. Stark who is a veterinary surgeon and he explained everything in detail and was so calm and caring about my dog. The technician and the receptionist were both so caring and helpful. I will never go to any other hospital for my animals and I have been to a lot of them. Thank you for your help with my dog.
LLAMA,yelp-376,I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored snow ice and drink is 10.60. There are other similar ice places I've been to that are way cheaper and better.
PaLM,yelp-376,"I wasn't particularly fond of Ice Monster Cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasn't impressed. Prices for a small flavored snow ice start at $5.95 and go up to $7.95 for their largest size which is a large (16 oz). I decided to try the small mango snow ice because I love mango and it was the only flavor they had that I liked. The snow ice was very sweet and the mango flavor was pretty strong, but there was nothing else to it. It was just ice and mango flavoring. There was no texture or anything to it. I was also disappointed that the snow ice was so small. I felt like I had barely eaten anything after I finished it. I also tried one of their bubble teas. I ordered the original milk tea with boba. The tea itself was pretty good, but the boba was a little too chewy for my liking. It was also a little too sweet. Overall, I was not impressed with Ice Monster Cafe. I thought the drinks were overpriced and the snow ice was not very good. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Human,yelp-376,"I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored ice was 5 which is served in a very tiny martini glass, large is about 10. I ordered the taro slush sensation, and a friend of mine got the thai tea, green tea float, and mango slush sensation. The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day. The workers were pretty nice but not very helpful or knowledgeable at all on their products, it was more like ordering from a vending machine with no personality or presence unfortunately. I dont think I will ever be back but if I do return, maybe next visit will be better."

Prices for a small flavored ice were a bit steep for the quality. I have seen other places that are similar to ice monster and had much better flavored ices. The flavored ices are good, however. I think the flavored ices should be about 1.00 each, and the snow ices should be about 1.50 each. Overall I liked the location of ice monster cafe. The staff was nice and they were always willing to make changes for the customers. They even offered to let me go ahead and pay for my meal and check out in the store before we got there. I dont know if the service was affected by the fact that I was the only customer, but they were always pleasant. They were a bit slow, however, but the staff was friendly and helpful.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-376,"I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored drink were more than reasonable though the service left something to be desired... The place fills up early so if you want one at 5pm, go earlier! Overall however it's an ok spot that serves decent cocktails in good spirits (although they last me only about 3 hours). Definitely not my favorite bar or restaurant from this trip especially when there are SO many other barsrestaurant choices close by!!"
OpenAI,yelp-376,"I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored snow ice are a little bit high compared to other cafes with similar offerings. However, it's always good to keep in mind that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food and drinks. If you're looking for a different cafe with quality drinks and snow ice, I can recommend a few recommendations based on your location and preferences!"
BigScience,yelp-376,"I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored glass were high (4 - 5) which made me question if they really had much to offer. The staff seemed friendly, the place there isn't too bad even though it feels like an old building with tons of windows that let in wintery cold wind. It is also just across from my uni so you can make your way over after class or before work without having to worry about traffic or rush hour."
PaLM,yelp-377,"This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a lot, letting in the cold air. The service was slow and the food was bland. We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

They also left the door open a I'm sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience at the restaurant. It's understandable that the cold temperature may have affected your dining experience. Perhaps you can reach out to the restaurant and provide feedback on your experience. They may be able to offer you some form of compensation or take steps to ensure that the temperature is more comfortable during future visits.
Eleuther-AI,yelp-377,"This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a smidge too long while waiting for another party to arrive so I worried about my coat being stolen when i pulled it off as soon they said ""we'll call you"" The food itself wasn't great, nothing out of this world or bad just ordinary meals that were served cold (the drinks didn't get changed). The service could've been better although there seemed plenty around us getting drunkeating during dinner time which made me feel awkward at times! However then again maybe more staff are needed? We did have 2 waitresses come back after making their rounds once everyone finished eating though who actually tried hard enough with serving water coffee etc...I guess its hit n miss..some nights will go well others won'y haha"
Tsinghua,yelp-377,"This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a bit, but not enough to make a difference. My boyfriend had the Thai food, I had the BBQ, both were delicious. The rice was a bit bland but that's my fault, not theirs. The waiter was friendly and the food was good, but there was a lack of atmosphere. My boyfriend and I had a lovely meal here, despite it being busy. It was very warm inside the restaurant and we had to put our coats on to warm up. The food was great, it was a buffet style and there was a large variety. My boyfriend had Thai, I had Vietnamese, and both were delicious. The desserts were great too. We were very satisfied and would definitely go back. Definitely worth a visit. The service was great, we were able to order the food we wanted and everything was delicious. The only thing I can complain about is that there wasn't enough food, but it was still great."

We had a big party and people trickled in at different times and they were very flexible. The drinks are very good. I had a watermelon drink and it was delicious. There are also 3 different sangrias which I've heard are good. They do a deal where you buy a pitcher of sangria and get a free tapas. The tapas I tried were really good. I had the garlic prawns, which were flavourful and quite big. The calamari was very good as well. The waitress recommended we try the beef cheeks and the veal cheeks and both were very tender and flavourful. The beef cheeks were my favourite. I really like this restaurant. It's comfortable, the food and drinks are very good and the service is excellent. 3196 W Broadway, Vancouver BC"

Human,yelp-378,"I went here on Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner. The waitress was so nice, very helpful and very knowledgable. We had a big party and people trickled in slowly and she didn't seem to mind. Everyone ordered and the food did take awhile to come, but that wasn't a big deal. We were going out drinking after this, so I ordered the burger. I know places like this tend to serve small plates, so something greasy and filling seemed like a better idea. I ordered my burger meduim. When it came, it was well done and so dry I couldn't eat it. It was served on a large ciabatta bread, and the burger was tiny compared to the bread. It was very disappointing. The fries were okay, though some were covered in chili powder. So the food was disappointing but the atmosphere was nice and the company was great, so it wasn't a total loss. Then it was time for the bill. The waitress kindly split the check, and a gratuity was added automatically due to our party size. Everyone but myself and another person paid with a card. Our bills were about 30 with tip included. We both left two twenty dollar bills. The waitress dropped off everyone's cards very quickly and then said, Have a great night, and disappeared. At first we gave her the benefit of the doubt, Oh maybe she does cards separaetly from cash and she'll come back with our change. She never came back with our change. We tried to find her, but we couldn't see her anywhere. We had another reservation so we couldn't stay and complain, so we just left without making a big fuss. I was completely floored by someone being that presumptuous and giving herself that huge of a tip. She essentially gave herself a 15 tip on a 25 bill twice. I will never go back to this place. The food is fancy but isn't worth the price. And I will never go somewhere that steals from me so blatantly."

BigScience,yelp-379,"No thank you food was over cooked bland and not getting hotter the sausage came out of there bacon and bread just get it done please Customer service is excellent. The only problem with this place is that their prices are extremely high for what they serve. The customer service in general, although pleasant, could be much better. I had a very uneasy time waiting while my order placed at 9:00pm waited almost an hour before being ready to eat. Highly recommend! Very nice atmosphere! Quick service and friendly staffs!!! My roommates and i were on our way from Brooklyn to Manhattan when we decided to go here! We ordered SOUP OF THE DAY - fried chicken salad with broccoli carrots- CROQUETTE DEPOT (a seafood dish) - SMOOTHIE! All dishes super tasty!! Would definitely come back! I was looking for something quick and healthy so went downstairs without prior reservation because that was all that was available..the people who greeted us felt like it took them forever to find me reserved spot...then said 4 or 5 minutes later the table would be ready to take care of me.....was told after 10 min it wouldn't be until 13min ago that they actually brought up the boxed soup....so really both the waitress and myself kind of thought she wasn't going to make her appoinment and give up a seat. It turned out fine though since I'm already signed up to print coupons which helped ease out some of the cost but still, probably won't return again"

Human,yelp-380,"Came here this past weekend to pick up some donuts before heading back to the OC. Got there about an hour before they closed so we knew we would be limited to selection. The place was quiet and clean. We picked up a dozen of their donut holes, an apple fritter, and an apple filled tostada looking pastry. it was pretty cheap too!! The donut holes tasted fresh. The apple fritter was huge but full of sugar to me. The apple filled tostada was the best..it was not too sweet and had good amount of apples in it. A great place to get a deal if you like donuts."

The line wasn't very long. Ordered a 12 count box of Donuts and a couple of cups of coffee. The donuts were a little on the dry side. But they were the best donuts I have ever had. The coffee was really good. Will definitely be back to try their ice cream. I got to try this place out for the first time this past weekend and I was not disappointed! The staff is so friendly and they are very helpful in recommending items that are new or have not been tried. They have a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dessert items and are a great value! I've been here a few times now and love it. The donuts are good, the breakfast is great, the sandwiches are great, and the coffee is really good. The only downside is the line.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-380,"Came here this past weekend to pick up some donuts before heading back to the OC. Got there about an hour before they closed so we knew we would be waiting a while, but it was worth every second of that wait! The atmosphere is wonderful and you feel like such welcome in just flipping on your lights at home or even driving by if its dark outside (something I have never done). Then once inside all those warm smells from their ovens wafting through out will make anyone want one more piece after another... So try them for yourself next time instead staying safe with unhealthy fast food lol We rang our bell over 6 times throughout 4 hours trying different items hoping something new had been put into rotation as sometimes everything comes off then what ever did come though tasted amazing no matter which side Redwood Blvd u take urself too,yummy!!! not sure how many people were working yet since i didn't get credit card number till later when owner came across street.asked her who has worked these four years she said only two owners staff are very loyal!!! We felt well looked upon espacially considering where else can ya go???"
PaLM,yelp-380,"Came here this past weekend to pick up some donuts before heading back to the OC. Got there about an hour before they closed so we knew we would be the only ones there. The donuts were fresh and delicious, and the staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area. The donuts are made fresh every day, and there is a wide variety to choose from. We tried the chocolate frosted, the maple bacon, and the apple fritter, and they were all delicious. The chocolate frosted was especially good, with a rich and creamy chocolate frosting. The maple bacon was also very good, with a nice balance of sweet and salty. The apple fritter was a little too sweet for our taste, but it was still very good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were happy to answer our questions about the donuts and give us recommendations. We also appreciated that they were willing to make a custom donut for us. We asked for a donut with chocolate frosting and bacon bits, and they were happy to oblige. Overall, we had a great experience at Donut House. The donuts were delicious, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the prices were reasonable. We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area."
LLAMA,yelp-380,"Came here this past weekend to pick up some donuts before heading back to the OC. Got there about an hour before they closed so we knew we would be cutting it close. We only got 5 donuts each and got out in less than 10 minutes. When we got to the cashier, she told us the credit card machine was down and asked if we had cash. Since we didn't and were in a hurry, we said we could come back later that evening with cash. She said, ""we close in an hour, so we wouldn't be able to do that."" So I asked her if she could at least put a hold on them so we could come back after they closed. She said, ""no, we can't do that either."" So I told her, ""OK, well we will have to take our business elsewhere then."" We weren't rude or anything, just disappointed. We told the workers it was a shame because the donuts looked good, and they agreed. The credit card machine issue isn't their fault, but they could have done something to make up for it. They could have said, ""OK, well we can hold them and you can come back tomorrow morning to pay for them."" Or they could have said, ""OK, well we can hold them for you and you can pay by phone."" There are many other ways they could have handled the situation, but they didn't. They were just very rude and unaccommodating. We ended up going to the Krispy Kreme a few blocks down the street and the workers there were very nice and accommodating, and the donuts were just as good, if not better. I'm a big fan of Randy's donuts and will still go back, but it's a shame because it was such a simple issue that could have been easily resolved. Stopped in to purchase some donuts. Got there around 9:30am. There was a line of about 4 people. I didn't expect to wait in line that long, but it is a Saturday. 4 people turned into about 10 in the time I waited. The guy in front of me decided to order 6 dozen donuts in various flavors, which took about 5 minutes. The girl behind the counter was very polite and nice. The customer in front of me paid and I made my order. The next part is where I get irritated. The guy behind me decided he wanted to pay with a credit card. The guy in front of me decided he wanted to pay with a credit card. The lady behind the counter said ""I'm sorry, we don't take credit cards, but you can use the ATM and get cash out and pay with that. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."" The man in front of me said ""I don't have enough cash, but you can run my card and I can just come back later when you open and pay you guys. I'll just go to the bank and get cash."" The lady behind the counter said ""I'm sorry, but we can't do that. We're not allowed to do that. You can use the ATM."" I'm thinking, how hard can it be to just run a credit card and have them come back and pay it later when they open? I also don't know why they don't take credit cards. I guess it's the only thing keeping them from being a 5 star donut shop. I'll still come back, but it was just a little irritating. The donuts are worth it, but I'd just bring cash. Was heading home from a weekend in LA and thought it would be worth making a pitstop here. It was definitely worth it! The donuts are delicious and the selection is great. I got the chocolate glazed donut, and it was awesome. It was a huge donut and had just the right amount of chocolate. The prices are cheap and the donuts are delicious. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in LA! I'm a big fan of Randy's donuts, and I try to go whenever I'm in the LA area. Their donuts are really good. I usually get the chocolate glazed donut because I feel like it's the best one they have. However, the last time I was there, the donut was a little stale. The chocolate glaze was still good, but the donut itself was not. So I don't know if it was a fluke, or if it was the last donut of the day, but it was a little disappointing. I still really like"
PaLM,yelp-381,The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used to have a delicious chili that I was addicted to and they just got rid of it. This was the last straw for me.
Eleuther-AI,yelp-381,"The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used a soggy littleneck clam chowder as appetizer and some grilled fish that tasted like it has been in there since last two days! The hamburger meat looked old, overcooked (definitely not fresh) and cold when you took your first bite from them but by then is too late; I already ate more than half portion!! For dessert...the mint chocolate chip ice cream with fudge sauce which could have easily made these deserts better still came out bland at times tasting almost sour - even though my girlfriend said she loves this flavor combination!!! It's sad because their ""old"" location downtown provided so much special memories (which can't be replaced). And now where ever i go around town thats all people talk about how great are classic burgers place on top 10 burger joints list!!!! So what happened? What did managementowner do differently or different luck....so many questions yet no answers remain same......just ok bar hoping next time will know whats up....."

Good Lord, it's just like when you were a kid. You could not get enough of that stuff! And it really kept me young! I think one day I'll stop going down there and start buying my own clothes....or will I? Just another time off..... One more thing I found today... First I thought he looked familiar (see above)...but NOPE!!!!! He's John Wayne Gacy!!! I'm thinking he may be our next visitor this afternoon. (What if we're wrong about his name???) lol Now you've made me want to go along too.. That's so very creepy looking though... I'm glad he's gone from your neighbourhood... There is something strange about people with a lot of money yet don't feel bad when others suffer because of lack of funds. When I read about someone being run over by an SUV or mowed down by a car while begging outside, suddenly everything seems okay. It's just sad when richer individuals behave like idiots all we care is how much money they'd make. Isn't it funny how some wealthy persons always put themselves out front whenever there's something going on around us? Yeah that's true... why do some people take advantage of those who need help getting through life???"

They used to have a fantastic selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and it's disappointing to hear that they don't offer them anymore. However, it's important to keep in mind that businesses often make menu changes due to a variety of reasons such as ingredients becoming unavailable or changes in consumer preferences. If you're still interested in going to this restaurant, I would suggest looking at their new menu and trying out some of their new dishes. Additionally, if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, you could reach out to the restaurant in advance to see if they can accommodate you."
LLAMA,yelp-381,"The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used to have a big menu with a lot of variety and now they have the same 3 things every week. Chicken wings, cheese sticks and fried dough. The only other thing they offer is a limited selection of bar food. All of which is average at best. The only reason we come here now is because of the beer. The do have a good selection. We stopped here recently to see what they had to offer. The first thing we noticed was that there are no TVs in the place. We started off with a couple of beers, we were happy with the selection. We both ordered the burger and fries for dinner. The burger was on the small side and was a little dry, they did have a good selection of toppings. The fries were ok, nothing special. I had the beef stew and the wife had the beef stew and cottage cheese. The stew was very good, it was a bit on the salty side but good. The cottage cheese was creamy and smooth. The dough was a bit chewy. The wife had the sausage, peppers and onions with cheese and I had the onion rings. The sandwich was excellent, the sausage was cooked just right and the peppers were flavorful. The onion rings were good, not much to say about them. I had the reuben and the wife had the fried bologna sandwich. The reuben was pretty good, but it was missing the Russian dressing, I like my reuben with a lot of sauce. The fried bologna sandwich was very good, they could have used a bit more bologna, but the fried onions were really good. We stopped in on a Friday night, it was pretty busy and we were lucky to get a table. We started with the wings, they are crispy and hot. They are very good, nice and juicy and tender. For dinner, I had the shepherd's pie and the wife had the Irish stew. The shepherd's pie was very good, but it needed a lot of salt. The stew was very good, it was loaded with chunks of beef, potatoes and carrots. The dumplings were light and fluffy. We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, it was packed so we ate at the bar. We started with the wings, they were very good, nice and crispy and hot.

If I could only go back in time and talk to the owner I would tell him to put back the onion rings. I used to go here every weekend.

LLAMA,yelp-382,"Descent place, a bit pricey on food beer though, but then it is Vegas. Great staff and manager. Very accommodating and friendly. Food was good and portions were adequate. 15 to park? You can't be serious. 30 per night for a hotel room, I understand, but parking? I think the 15 parking fee is for all of the hotels on the Strip now. I believe parking is free. I just checked the Rio website and it says parking is free for hotel guests."

Thank you for sharing your review of the place! It's great to hear that you found the staff and manager friendly and accommodating. While the food may have been a bit pricey, it's good to know that the portions were adequate and tasted good. Vegas can certainly be an expensive city, so it's important to keep that in mind when budgeting for meals and drinks. Overall, it sounds like you had a good experience there."
Tsinghua,yelp-382,"Descent place, a bit pricey on food beer though, but then it is Vegas. Great staff and manager. Very accommodating and friendly. Food was good and portions were adequate.

BigScience,yelp-382,"Descent place, a bit pricey on food beer though, but then it is Vegas. Great staff and manager. Very accommodating and friendly. Food was good and portions were adequate. We will be back. Stayed here for two nights in the end of April with my family. It was an extended trip to find room at this resort after coming from Colorado via Denver International Airport. My wife had booked a suite that she really wanted based upon their website pictures. When we arrived there was no such suite available so they let us choose between one of three rooms facing the pool or suites which also involved walking across the street. They have nothing about these rooms except through pictures you can see what looks like few furnishings and very little carpeting. I wasn't sure if I want our kids get wet because we did not realize how far off the reserve pool area is until almost right next door. The other 3 rooms didn't look much better either none of them offered any views over the house across the street as viewed by pictures. One of them did offer 2 beds (I think), however when you turn into bed your head falls onto that wall where all doors are open and it felt cold never mind sleeping in total darkness! At check out they seemed totally unaware of what happened during those stay even stating ""We tell people do not walk past each others."" Upon arrival at 6am they gave me my first breakfast choice: 1 egg white omelet 2 slices bacon wrapped waffles. Oh yes I know I'm being sarcastic...but seriously. You just can't beat the value and convenience of staying near airport compared to paying hotel prices many times more elsewhere. However considering location, amenities, quality service etc.. I'd say it's comparable to Best Westerns I've stayed in prior to visiting Las Vegas. Probably less expensive than BW's but not cheap, especially since you're serving breakfast every morning yourself? Or maybe you never brought anything along with you anyway? Great experience overall - location, cleanliness, courteous, quiet. And great prices on dining nearby! We came down for a business meetingconference and needed something close to the Strip (our main goal). This property met both criteria. The location was perfect; within walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and casinos. There was plenty of parking, although one day at night they would have been safer locked up. Rooms were nicely decorated, comfortable, spacious, and conveniently located. Every staff member I encountered throughout the 4 days I had remained there made themselves readily accessible (and available) for assistance whenever I asked. The outside view isn't extraordinary, but if you've paid 100night for a cottage with only a patio, that's pretty standard. Really nice beach chairs set up inside which meant less litter. Beach towels provided. Friendly employees who welcomed everyone. Nice outdoor pool. Indoor jacuzzi hot tub was enclosed but a step away from another bathroom. A small fitness center included free weights, treadmill, elliptical bikes, rowers, stair machines, squats stations, cable station, and a weight bench. If you'd rather go surfing you'll need to rent gear from town (10-20 per person). This was our second visit to this condo in January 2012. It's extremely well situated. It has everything necessary for vacationing: poolside cabanas, hammocks, tables, chairs, gas grill, tennis courts, Jacuzzis in the interior, playground equipment for children under 5 years old, picnic table, boogie boards, sand volleyball court, shuffleboard, bicycles, bikes for hire, golf carts, bicycle lockers, a laundry room, internet access, billiards, and water slides. Outside there's also a BBQ deck space and a balcony overlooking the ocean. All guests receive a daily newspaper delivered directly to their unit, complimentary use of kayaks, paddleboards, snorkeling gear, and scuba tanks, discount rates on massages, spa services, hair appointments, book clubs, beauty care products, local restaurant recommendations, transportation to various attractions including rides around the island, excursions with tour guides to view crabs and beaches, grocery provisions and meals with our favorite chef, personalized concierge services, and security 24 hours a day 7 days a week. As stated before, it's just steps away from Seven Mile Beach State Park, Four Seasons Resort Atlantis Paradise Island, the Aria casino, lunch options, bars, stores, pharmacies, banks, dive shops, and souvenir vendors. Only 20 minutes from Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina areas of the city. Definitely recommend this facility."
LLAMA,yelp-383,"Beautiful dining room hidden in Old Town Scottsdale. We made a reservation and scored an outdoor table on a lovely May evening. It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy a great meal and a few drinks. When we first sat down, we were greeted with a basket of bread. Not just any bread, this bread was amazing. The butter was delicious and the bread itself was incredible. We were also brought a bowl of bruschetta. For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Marsala with angel hair pasta. The chicken was nice and tender and the Marsala sauce was delicious. The angel hair pasta was cooked well and had a nice flavor. The plate was served with the bread we had previously had, which was a very nice touch. I was a bit disappointed to find that we were not offered dessert. I didn't even see a dessert menu, which was a huge disappointment. We had a great experience at LUCCA. The food was great and the service was wonderful. We will definitely be back.

Tsinghua,yelp-383,"Beautiful dining room hidden in Old Town Scottsdale. We made a reservation and scored an outdoor table on a lovely May evening. It was the perfect night to sit outside, but they're opening a second dining room inside the space as well. The food was great and we got to sample a few new dishes that they're working on. The wine list is pretty solid as well, with lots of options to choose from. 9.810 1311 E. Baseline Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85251 The Yarded We were going to try and go to this new restaurant in downtown Phoenix this week, but it had already been booked for a private party. The restaurant has been in the works for a while and is the brainchild of two restaurateurs from Chicago. They opened in mid-May and it's got a nice rustic vibe with wood accents throughout. The menu is a mix of modern American cuisine with some Northwest influences, and the food is very good. The beer and wine list is solid as well. We tried the Grapefruit Thai Chicken Salad and the Ginger Shrimp with Oven Roasted Tofu, and both were delicious. 9.210 401 E. Baseline Rd., Phoenix, AZ 85004 10.110 The Market Bar and Kitchen This restaurant is new to Scottsdale and we were looking forward to trying it. The restaurant opened in April and it's a mix of casual and formal dining, with a nice mix of outdoor seating as well. The menu is modern American with an Asian influence, and the food is good. We got the Bang Bang Chicken, which is basically a meatball in a fried egg with truffled cream sauce. The truffle sauce was good, but we both thought the meatball was a little bland. We got a salad and a chicken entree, and both were good. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh. 9.310 455 N. Scottsdale Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85261 10.110 11.510 11.510 Foodland - Scottsdale This new Scottsdale restaurant opened in mid-May and it's a good addition to the Scottsdale food scene. The restaurant is a modern take on a classic diner and it's got a lot of different options for lunch and dinner. We went for lunch on a recent weekday and got the ""Farm to Table"" meal, which was 25. The food was good and the portions were huge. We got a small order of the truffle mac and cheese and it was really good. The lunch menu also includes a few vegetarian options, which are available by request. The atmosphere is good and it's a good place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. 9.610 515 E. Van Buren St., Scottsdale, AZ 85261 10.910 11.210 10.510 Bar Central One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley is back, and it's back with a vengeance. The restaurant opened in May and it's a big, bold space with lots of dark wood and dark accents. The menu is a mix of modern American cuisine with some Southwestern influence, and the food is really good. We tried the Prime Rib with Smoked Balsamic, and it was amazing. The steak was tender and juicy and the balsamic sauce was perfect. The restaurant also has a really good beer and wine list. We're excited to see what Bar Central does next. 10.510 115 N. Scottsdale Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85261 10.710 11.110 10.510 11.210 Casa Elena The restaurant opened in April and it's a good addition to the Scottsdale dining scene. The restaurant is modern Mexican with a modern twist, and the food is really good. We got the Seafood and Pork Enchiladas and they were amazing. The pork was really tender and the enchiladas were topped with a great sauce. The atmosphere is good and the service is great."

They offer about 75 off every Tuesday and Friday after work which makes it very affordable for those who want more than one item or some seasonal items that are on sale-but not too expensive either....I always get my money worth there:). The selection here at Tilly's has grown so much since I first started going in, although they do sell like most retailers (womens sizes come before mens), if your'e only looking specifically maybe because its something specific then id suggest just browsing around inside yourself instead as by shopping online through them many things don't carryover into stores..hope this helps"

BigScience,yelp-386,"Firstly, we decided to give this restaurant another try after finding our first experience a lot of bucks for little bang. Going in with an open mind, we thought that it might be the kind of place where if you pay more than 40 per person and get dished up any old type of food (which is what happened) - you'd still have all kinds of fun looking at your friends eat. We arrived around 8:30 pm after having seen some photos on Instagram as well as other bloggers' experiences. The staff was pleasant enough but not overly enthusiastic about trying new things or sharing different dishes from their menu so I think my husband managed to keep them busy by asking lots of questions."
Human,yelp-386,"Firstly, we decided to give this restaurant another try after finding our first experience a lot of bucks for little bang. Going in with an open mind, we thought that we would go with recommendations from the waiter. We ordered the arugula salad with artichokes, a mixed green salad and the chef's signature ravioli, as well as the pasta with porcini mushrooms for appetizers. The salads were acceptable, however the artichiokes were tough and had chewy skin on them. The appetizer pasta with mushrooms was good, but bland and the ravioli was exceptional. Having been in Italy many times and eaten in many authentic italian restaurants, this of course was not the same experience. Our waiter overwhelmed us with information about where everything came from in the Mediterranean and Italy and made us feel stupid even though we could tell she never has been there. She recommeded a whole fish which she claimed was sweet and firm based on its diet of crustaceans, and it was neither sweet nor firm and tasted like a large sardine. The waiter filleted the fish, and took so long it was cold when she served it. The fish was flavourless and cold, and the accompanying zuchinnis were tasteless and the fried potatoes tasted like they were the frozen variety. The sauces with the fish, one which was olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and black olives, and the other was parsley, olive oil and orgegano, were so overpowering, in the end we just asked for plain lemon. We didnt finish the meal. The waiter was cognizant that we were unhappy with the meal, and she didn't bother to even ask us if we enjoyed it, she just removed the uneaten plates and didn't say a word. So for 350 for two people with no drinks and a half bottle of wine, this was a lot of fluff. Go to any fish tavern in Montreal and you'll get a good whole grilled fish, served hot and with a smile for a 100 for two. Its a rip. Too bad. Not going back."

The tables were sticky and the floor was littered with food crumbs. Overall, we had a very negative experience at this restaurant. We would not recommend it to anyone. Here are some other restaurants in the area that we would recommend instead:  [The Ivy](https://www.theivy.com/) is a classic American restaurant with a modern twist. The food is delicious and the service is excellent.  [The Publican](https://www.thepublicanrestaurant.com/) is a gastropub that serves up some of the best comfort food in the city. The atmosphere is lively and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  [Girl & the Goat](https://www.girlandthegoat.com/) is a farm-to-table restaurant that serves up creative and delicious dishes. The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive."
Tsinghua,yelp-386,"Firstly, we decided to give this restaurant another try after finding our first experience a lot of bucks for little bang. Going in with an open mind, we thought that perhaps the quality would be better, but the bill was still over 200 for two people. I can't imagine how that compares to other restaurants in Auckland. The food wasn't great, and I'm surprised that the quality has not improved over the years. My friend had some sort of seafood pasta dish, and it was so overcooked that it was falling apart in my hands. It tasted like it had been sitting in a pool of water for days. The server was pleasant, but I didn't feel like she gave us the personal service that other places in the area do. The menu has the classic list of Italian dishes, and the prices were on the higher side for a family restaurant. We decided to share a starter, but they were very pricey for what they were. A half a litre of Prosecco was over 40, and a 4oz cheese and charcuterie plate was 16. The restaurant is right in the middle of the Auckland CBD, and there are many places within walking distance. It is a bit of a trek to get to, but the views of the city are worth the drive. This place is quite pricey for what it is. It's definitely worth trying, but if you have a very good experience, let us know. Have you been to Restaurant Mira? Let us know in the comments! The last time I posted, I mentioned that I would like to make a blog post about a really good place for a night out. I figured that a good place to start would be a Japanese restaurant, and the one that I chose was Restaurant Mira. This place is located in the city centre, but it's not the best for a late night meal. However, this restaurant is perfect for a casual date or a romantic evening out. I've been to this restaurant twice, and each time has been very enjoyable. The food is always very fresh, and the atmosphere is relaxed and very comfortable. The wait staff are very attentive and friendly, and the staff are always happy to answer any questions you may have. I'm sure you'll find this restaurant to be a very good choice for a night out. My first visit was a birthday dinner, and we went with a group of friends. We had a large party platter, which was very large for two people. The appetizers were delicious, and the portions were very generous. The meat dishes were excellent, and the dessert was just as good as the others. My birthday dinner was special, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. I decided to visit again last week, and we decided to try a different set of dishes. This time, we decided to try the large set menu. It was a great deal, and I think we got a decent portion of everything on the menu. The portions were not too big, and I think we got a great taste of the restaurant's specialties. The menu is simple, but the food was delicious. I'm glad that we were able to visit again, and I'm sure that this restaurant will be a regular place to visit in the future. Have you been to Restaurant Mira? Let us know in the comments! Have you been to a Japanese restaurant? Let us know in the comments! The first time I went to the Marquee, I thought that the food was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. However, I had forgotten about this place, and I hadn't been back in a while. I decided to give this restaurant another try, and I had a very pleasant surprise. This place is a bit different from the others in Auckland, and it's a bit more casual. The decor is very colourful and fun, and the staff are very friendly. I went with a group of friends, and we had a very good time. The food was very good, and the portions were large. The appetizers were very good, and I was able to try several different things. My friends and I had some steak, and it was tender and tasty. The portions were very large, and we had a lot of leftovers. The dessert was excellent, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. I've been to this restaurant several times, and it's always a good time. I think that this restaurant has a lot of potential, and I hope that they keep up the good work. Have you been to the Marquee? Let us know in the comments! I've never been to the Marquee before, and I'm very curious about this place. It's a very casual restaurant, and I'm sure that it's a good place for a quick bite."
OpenAI,yelp-386,"Firstly, we decided to give this restaurant another try after finding our first experience a lot of bucks for little bang. Going in with an open mind, we thought that it would be helpful to read some recent reviews of the restaurant to get a sense of what others are saying about it. You can also check out the restaurant's menu and see if there are any dishes or drinks that you're particularly interested in trying. Additionally, it might be helpful to call the restaurant ahead of time to make a reservation and ask any questions you may have about the menu or the atmosphere of the restaurant. By doing some research and preparation beforehand, you can go into the experience feeling informed and confident, which will likely make for a better overall experience."
LLAMA,yelp-386,"Firstly, we decided to give this restaurant another try after finding our first experience a lot of bucks for little bang. Going in with an open mind, we thought that perhaps their BBQ options might be worth a shot. The interior is very dimly lit and decorated with old, rustic decor. The service was quick and efficient, with a friendly waitress. We had the Lamb Ribs with a side of Grilled Vegetables. The ribs were cooked medium rare, but the quality of the meat was disappointing. The meat was fatty and not very tender. As for the sauce, it was very sweet and tangy, which seemed like a nice touch, but the sweetness was overpowering to the extent that it masked the meat's original flavor. The meat fell off the bone easily, which is always a plus. The vegetables were fairly average, nothing to write home about. The mushrooms were cooked nicely. As for the side dishes, we had the French Fries and Sweet Potato Fries. The fries were underseasoned and needed more salt. We also tried their Sweet Potato Fries, which were quite bland. They were thinly cut and needed a lot of seasoning. The most disappointing thing about this meal was the huge mess it made. The ribs were not pre-cut, so we had to cut the meat ourselves. This resulted in the sauce being all over the table, making it difficult to eat. The sides were also not very good, with the fries being bland and the sweet potato fries being too thin and bland. The price of the meal was reasonable, but the quality was very disappointing. In a city with so many great BBQ options, it is unfortunate that the grilled meat options are so poor."
Human,yelp-387,"I loved this place! We came here on one of our last days on Vegas and found it while walking around the Golden Nugget. When we sat down to take a look at the Menu's, I decided to look on yelp and see what the reviews were. Once I saw the 4 star rating, I know I was going to be impressed. When I said take a look at the Menu, it took awhile due to there being lots to choose from! We had a table of 6 and we ordered pretty much everything from breakfast to lunch. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and all I have to say is WOW! These were probably the best Eggs Benedict I have tasted in a long long time. I also ordered a short stack of pancakes which were also pretty tasty. The customer service was awesome as well! You definitely need to stop on by if you're in the Golden Nugget!"
Tsinghua,yelp-387,"I loved this place! We came here on one of our last days on Vegas and found it while walking around the Golden Nugget. When we sat down to take our table, we were greeted with two more surprises. We were given a free burger! I had never had one before and I am glad we got to try it! I'm not a huge burger person, but I can't complain! This burger was really good! We were also given a free drink! This drink was an awesome cranberry drink with soda. The cranberry flavor was really good and the soda added a nice touch to it. This place is super busy on weekends and holidays so you'll want to go early or come on a weekday. If you are looking for a good burger, you definitely need to check out this place! I've been wanting to try the 2nd Avenue Grill for a long time and I finally got to try it last weekend! It was my first time trying it and I loved it! This place is in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. We walked to this place from our hotel because it was pretty close. When we walked in, the place was packed! I wasn't sure if we were going to get a table, but they were able to seat us. I really like the menu here. There are so many different burgers and sandwiches on the menu that you can't go wrong! We started with the Ahi Tuna Burger. This burger was really good! It was juicy and the ahi tuna was very fresh. It also had a nice grilled flavor. I'm a huge fan of burgers, but I have to say that this was one of my favorite burgers! Next, we ordered the BLT Cheeseburger. This burger was really good! It had a nice crispy exterior and the bacon and cheese melted nicely. The only thing that I didn't like was the bun. The bun was a little hard and it was a little too sweet. The BLT Burger was very good, but the bun was the only thing that I didn't like about it. If you are looking for a burger that is a little different, you definitely need to try the 2nd Avenue Grill! I've been wanting to try the A-1 Steakhouse for a long time, but I finally got to try it last weekend! It was my first time trying it and I loved it! This place is in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. We walked to this place from our hotel because it was pretty close. When we walked in, the place was packed! I wasn't sure if we were going to get a table, but they were able to seat us. I really like the menu here. There are so many different steaks and steak options on the menu that you can't go wrong! We started with the Margarita 1870. This was one of the best margaritas that I have ever had! It was creamy and smooth and had a nice lime flavor. This was the perfect drink to start off our meal! Next, we ordered the Angus Ribeye. This steak was amazing! It was juicy and tender and had a nice grilled flavor. The only thing that I didn't like was the bearnaise sauce. It was a little bland and it took away from the steak. I really enjoyed the steak, but I would have preferred a different sauce. If you are looking for a steak that is a little different, you definitely need to try the A-1 Steakhouse! I've been wanting to try the Bonanza Steakhouse for a long time, but I finally got to try it last weekend! It was my first time trying it and I loved it!

Eleuther-AI,yelp-387,"I loved this place! We came here on one of our last days on Vegas and found it while walking around the Golden Nugget. When we sat down to take a look at their menu there were no prices listed, just options for salads or sandwiches - so I had them ask about pricing before deciding what would be best since they both appeared pretty good priced (more than 10 each). They brought us menus with all items in writing including price which was nice as well but then mentioned that those who don't want salad can get any sandwich without toast instead if you are not into bread products...perfect because after eating veggie wraps from 4 different places yesterday today looking forward another round..yikes!! So glad she said something when my FIL asked ""are these things large enough?"" She laughed saying yes....and gave him his answer he wanted right away-a BLTPBJ Sandwich w none. The only thing lady fingers is missing compared other sites like Costco etc where u have bagged frozen ones too choose your own size.....but still awesome deal considering how many servings per jar usually makes me think twice unless i am making soup lol"
BigScience,yelp-387,"I loved this place! We came here on one of our last days on Vegas and found it while walking around the Golden Nugget. When we sat down to take a break, a server asked if we'd like an appetizer or dessert? I told her I'd probably eat some breadsticks at home but she was so nice that when I went back later in the evening for dinner I took them with me and had spicy chicken wings with chips (which were delicious)! Her name was Lori and she's awesome!! It may have been too late by then because everyone else ordered their desserts already, but that's okwe just ate those right away! The food is good - as usual, lots of great options for vegan dining. The service isn't always there though. Sometimes you won't get anywhere near lunch time without having your order taken out first. But my neighbor paid 80 per person for two lunches and they didn't even bother checking on him until he left. It's completely different from what people expect from the classic BBQ restaurant that gets millions of visitors every year - it's more elegant than its southern cousins, yet still offers meat grilling classics such as ribs and chicken. This spot has become part of the San Diego culinary scene thanks to chef Eric Gruber, who relocated his Austin-based Dishman Kitchen into Balboa Park after moving nine years ago. Like other restaurants in town, Chef Gruber uses local produce whenever possible, including organic fruits, vegetables, wild-caught seafood and products made by small producers."

When we sat down to take a drink, the waitress asked us if we’d like to take a shot of their “House Fireball” with our drinks. We said sure and she told us it was a secret menu item. The shot came and it was amazing! We asked her what was in it and she said it was a combination of 151 and Fireball. We had to order another one! The food here was great too! We had the prime rib and it was cooked perfectly. We also had the mac and cheese and it was delicious. The service here was excellent! The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be coming back here again next time we’re in Vegas!"

Considered the VIP section but the premium seats were much closer to the action and the view was better. We were able to see all the pyrotechnics, which were amazing. We also got to experience the whole show and were not blocked by anyone. The only downside was that the seats were a little bit cramped and we were a bit close to the people in front of us. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely recommend sitting in the premium seats."

Considered the VIP section but after seeing the seats, don't think they're really worth it...they seat further back but the seats are rather lush. Guess it really boils down to whether or not you really want the champagne! Saw some people in the splash zone move up to the'premium seats' shortly after the first gig - I'd pay the extra 30 to not sit in the splash zone...but if you can choose seats in the 2nd row up I guess its good savings? I prefer Orchestra like seats so H did us just fine. Don't look up any videos on this! It's best to go in with no expectations...get ready to be blown away!!:)"

Love this show for it's uniqueness as well as great music and dancing!!! The best part about it is that you can sit anywhere around the arena so if your next stop after the show was somewhere else then just walk up to wherever there are empty sections right?!!"
Tsinghua,yelp-388,"Ridiculously amazing show!!!! Hubby and I were completely astonished! Sat in the premium seats (the middle between splash zone and VIP) section A, H 1516. Considered the VIP section but too expensive so we sat there and got bumped down a row for our third row tickets. Also could have gone with the VIP seats and not had to pay 150. Overall, 2 thumbs up! Not the cheapest show in Vegas but definitely worth every penny. You can take a cab back to the airport if you have to leave in the middle of the show. We were on the Strip and had to leave at the end of the show so we had to take a cab back to the airport. But worth the 150.00 in my opinion. Great show!!! Loved the music, the lights, the dancing, the fireworks, the ending of the show was awesome! Would recommend to everyone. One of my favorites so far!"

We were so close we could see the sweat on the singers faces. We were also right on the aisle so that when the cast made their way down to the VIP section we could reach out and touch them. I would HIGHLY recommend these seats. Seats were great. Very close to the stage. Incredible show! I loved every minute of it! Loved the show, incredible music! Seats were great! Love the theater!

It was my birthday and we got to sit in the splash zone. If you're sitting in the front row on the right side, it is the best seat in the house because you get the best view of the stage. The music was loud and you can definitely feel it. There were some surprises along the way but I don't want to give anything away. Good show.

It provides a strong pool of trainers who are professional and experienced and willing to provide guidance and help to you in whatever your fitness goal is. Providing access to trainers is a really good idea, as it's hard to keep on top of all the training plans and regimes that you have in your own head. A good trainer can really keep you focused and accountable. City Athletic Club also provides a pool of members who have been through the same journey as you and can offer some really good advice and encouragement. It's also easy to get lost in the amount of equipment and what's available at City Athletic Club. There's a whole range of equipment available to get you started from a variety of disciplines including gym equipment, kettlebells, free weights, bikes, rowing machines, elliptical trainers, stair climbers, climbing walls, pilates, weights, and body weight circuits. They also have a really nice selection of resistance bands, weightlifting belts, power racks and plyometric benches. Interested in running? There's a 5km run every week in the gym and plenty of training groups, including a beginners group, a group for runners who have a good level of fitness, and a group for more experienced runners. I have also been in a group for half marathon training, which was great. If you're more interested in weightlifting, you can take part in a couple of different training sessions including a women's only class and a mixed class. It's also really easy to book a personal training session with one of the trainers and they have a range of plans and training programmes that you can use to help you reach your goals. If you're looking to get a really strong core, there's a strong focus on core training in all the classes and groups. They also offer yoga and pilates classes, which I think is a great idea. If you want to get fit but you're not sure what to do or how to do it, City Athletic Club is a great place to start. There's a great selection of trainers who are all very knowledgeable and can help you with all your fitness needs.

It's clean, the people are friendly, and they don't let a bunch of rude members get in the way of a great workout. Great place! Terrible customer service. The girl was very rude and she wouldn't allow me to cancel my contract that I had signed 3 days prior. I have had an issue with the billing and I have been trying to get my money back since. They have not been helpful. All I have to say is that, I am a trainer here and the way the staff treats us is amazing. I have never been happier with any company that I have worked for. It's nice to know that you work for a company that appreciates all the hard work you put in. I have been coming here for years. No other gym in the city can compete with the cleanliness and service here. This gym is always clean and they have 3 floors of cardio equipment that is never out of date. Best gym in Chicago. Always clean. Lots of equipment. Great trainers. I feel like a family member there. I really liked the concept of personal trainers at this gym and working together with a small community of like-minded people towards a common goal. I never felt uncomfortable or self-conscious working out because there was always someone there to help and encourage me. The atmosphere was very friendly and welcoming, and the facility was always very clean. I went to this gym for about a month. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the atmosphere of it because I am not a big fan of gyms in general. I am quite self-conscious, and I never feel comfortable at gyms. I also hate the fact that most gyms are so dirty that you would have to be crazy to use any of the equipment. This gym was great! I felt like I was welcomed into a family.

BigScience,yelp-390,"110hr for labor ridiculous. Dan is the slowest and most ill informed person I have ever dealt with. He never tells you that until after he has to do something, but it was pretty obvious how bad his knowledge of what was going on in my body was. I am a submissive woman looking to explore more about BDSM play through your company. What are some good places where people can get advice or suggestions regarding this? I would recommend checking out the book, Dominance by Master Slave: A Guide, written by Kathy Atkins. This gives lots of helpful tips concerning domination, as well as instructions for setting up an effective bondage scene including suggestion for objects for restraint (there's no reason why there can't be orgasmic pleasure at the same time). It's available from Amazon here - The next section describes her experiences having sex while under medication which includes details on possible side effects such as: dizziness, nausea andor vomiting, dry mouth, drowsy feeling, constipation, difficulty breathing etc., although Mike seems to think she had none of these concerns...."
Tsinghua,yelp-391,"Try to catch Emily's class -you will not be disappointed. She's amazing. Gorgeous downtown studio. Free Garage parking. Friendly staff. Great monthly deals... Update to original post just to say I love it here. My instructor is excellent and I am having a great time. I just finished my 100 hour yoga teacher training and I am working on my certification now. I think this is a great way to get started in teaching yoga and it's a great way to get into the studio and make new friends! I've been here 3 times, once as a student and twice as a teacher. The teachers are very knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach. They are helpful and encouraging and willing to go the extra mile. They are also very supportive of students who want to continue their studies to become teachers. If you are looking for a studio with good teachers, you've found it. I am a new student at Yoga University and I'm so happy to be here! I was nervous about my first class because I am a very new student and I had no idea what to expect. However, the staff and instructors are very welcoming and helpful. I feel like I'm learning a lot and I'm having a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to my next class! I had a wonderful experience as a first-time student at Yoga University. The staff and instructors are so warm and welcoming. I am looking forward to continuing my studies here."

Update to original post just to say I am thrilled with my experience in this salon and highly recommend it! I had a great experience at the Kinky Salon Spa! The owner was so helpful, professional and friendly. She explained everything clearly as well. Kinky is by far one of the best salons I've ever been to!!! Great atmosphere and Salonista (she calls her clients) are extremely knowledgeable about hair care products!! My 8 year old daughter loves going there too!!! This place has the most beautiful environment but also the friendliest people you could wish for. It always felt like home when visiting their store and that made me feel safe having an appointment!!

""Very nice evening meal enjoyed here eating outside overlooking the sea. Many different courses served. Excellent wine selection"" ""I went over to visit friends who live near there today- they recommended this very good pub where everyone seemed happy.

Human,yelp-392,My husband and a few of his close friends tried this place for lunch one day and had a great lunch! He was so pleased with his experience he wanted to take me there for dinner. We started with calamari which was so greasy we could hardly eat it. The pieces were literally dripping with grease. For main course I ordered the special of the day which was seared ahi tuna. It was charred and totally cooked thru. It was more like a tough steak than a piece of fish. I sent it back and ordered the salmon instead. The salmon was burned as well and so salty it was inedible. Needless to say we left and had to eat elsewhere. The bright light is the service. Friendly and attentive! The staff made an awful dining experience somewhat tolerable. Needless to say I won't be dining again here unless things really change in the kitchen!
Tsinghua,yelp-392,"My husband and a few of his close friends tried this place for lunch one day and had a great lunch! He was so pleased with his experience he wanted to know if they had a phone number so he could call them. I gave him the number and he did. He called them up and made reservations.

LLAMA,yelp-392,"My husband and a few of his close friends tried this place for lunch one day and had a great lunch! He was so pleased with his experience he wanted to share it with me. So on a recent Friday night we decided to check it out for dinner. This place is located on 17th Street and 6th Avenue. As we made our way over to the restaurant we walked up and down the street as there is quite a few nice places to eat around here. We had made a reservation for 8pm, so we got to the restaurant around 7:30pm. The restaurant had a nice open feeling when we walked in. There was a bar on the left as we walked in and the hostess stand was directly in front of us. The restaurant was about half full when we got there. The server took us to our table which was directly in front of the kitchen. It was a nice table and the open kitchen was great as we got to watch them cooking the food. The server came over and took our drink order. We were in the mood for something different so we decided to try a cocktail off their cocktail list. I went with the Georgia Peach Sour and my husband went with the Pumpernickel Sour. They both were good. After looking at the menu we decided to start with the the Baked Clams and the Broccoli. We also decided to split the Chicken for two for dinner. The Baked Clams and the Broccoli both came out at the same time. The Baked Clams were delicious. They came with a nice amount of breadcrumbs on top and were filled with chorizo. The Broccoli came with a nice amount of Parmesan on top. The broccoli was crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. After we finished our appetizer the server brought out our Chicken. The chicken came on a half roasted chicken on top of a potato hash. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were nice and crispy. We both agreed that the dish was very good. When we were done with our dinner we were both stuffed. The server brought over the dessert menu and we decided to split the Chocolate Pudding. We were not disappointed with the dessert. It was very good. The server also brought over two espressos. We really enjoyed our dinner. The service was very good and the food was fantastic! We would definitely go back here again."

My wife and i felt the best of our lives at this restaurant while visiting from out of town last weekend...the burger is amazing on its own but when you add the cheese sauce it takes the dish over the top....we ordered 2 ribeye steaks that melded perfectly together.....and don't forget the fries..yum yum yummy We have been customers of Famous Bistro since 2004. The owner's are always there to welcome us into their home away from home. This place has such beautiful decorations throughout. It also offers some tasty foods which make any visit worthwhile. It's located next door to the mountain biking trails off Highway 6 (on Sunset Road). They offer outdoor seating too if that's your thing. The view is stunning! A perfect location near an area where many motorcycles go by during the day. Food was delicious. Staff friendly. Dinner 40 per person or more depending upon what you order."

Sheesh, you guys, you may be busy but we have other customers that are screaming for attention and trying desperately not go without AC this summer in Texas... I was just told by another company I work with all day every week - they do most of their business online (like myself) so there is no receptionist or one person who can answer questions over an entire facility....They don't even get any walk-in traffic anymore! It's ALL done via computer chats as well!!!"

It is not like I am asking for money or anything. I called your company last week because of an issue with our air conditioning system. My wife was able to reach someone who answered her questions about ACs in general - she said they were very helpful. Being that they are from Virginia it made sense that they could help us. After 2 phone calls (yesterday) dealing with another person's office and no one being available to answer any further questions I decided to call back today. The lady I talked to took down what I wanted to discuss and gave me some ideas as well as suggested we do things by telephone so I didn't get into too much detail. We've always had Rheem units before and this year we're getting new ones and again their tech came out to show us how everything works. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all there is to know about these units - they are pretty complicated! Hopefully I'll make more progress when he comes next time."

Human,yelp-395,Ppl were ranting about the All natural burgers - they are frozen patties. There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever. 20 min wait just for ice cream. The kicker of the whole experience was the 6 dollar burger that looks like it came from In and Out. Place is ridiculous. Wont last.

Was told I had to pay for a burger. The employee said to me I could just leave it there if I didn't want to pay. How rude is that? i don't even know how to describe the horror i felt being in this establishment. i was standing in the line for 20 minutes only to be told it was going to be a 20 minute wait. Not enough employees. So you're left waiting in line to order a long time. Then you wait for your order. And wait. And wait. This place has got to be the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been to. The food was cold and disgusting. It was more like cafeteria food. It was a shame that I had to pay for it.

OpenAI,yelp-395,"Ppl were ranting about the All natural burgers - they are frozen patties. There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever. 20 min I'm sorry to hear that. It is important for businesses to provide accurate information about their products and to manage customer expectations regarding wait times. Perhaps, the restaurant could have been more transparent about their frozen patties and provided an estimated wait time for their customers. It may also be helpful for the restaurant to review their operational processes to reduce wait times for customers, such as adding more staff or improving their kitchen efficiency."

BigScience,yelp-395,"Ppl were ranting about the All natural burgers - they are frozen patties. There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever. 20 min later it finally came out and everyone loved it. Friendly staff, fast service but not pricey for what you get. I had two burgers with cheese fries one day and my husband got an entree which included coleslaw and french fries. We both enjoyed our meal! I have been here three times in the past six months and each time has been extremely good! The staff is friendly and very helpful when trying to find something that we don't know yet. They also make sure everything on your order is correct before putting them together so there isn't any mistake made by anyone else. It has become a favorite spot where I go almost every single week since they opened up!! The restaurant offers Premium TGI Fridays Burger (BBQ Chicken) with Crunchy Onions Pickles Salad and Turkey Bacon Ranch Pizza with a side salad We stopped by this place after seeing some reviews online saying it's worth checking out, even though we're not fans of Uptown Grille. However, as soon as we walked in, we could tell by just looking how pretty their interior looked along with how nice their decor was overall. Upon entering the dining area, we noticed the tables are set up nicely with chairs placed next to each other and facing away from the open kitchen. Then again, if you're interested in ordering takeout or delivery you'd be able to see what's happening within the kitchen all while eating outside. Even more importantly, during COVID-19 these places do allow people inside and they're keeping things clean as well. For example, we've stayed safe because they've provided disposable masks and gloves throughout the entire establishment. To sum up, Uptown Grille definitely looks neat and feels quite comfortable especially considering there's only limited space available. Overall, we felt completely satisfied upon experiencing lunchtime at Uptown Grill, which includes Prime Rib Sandwich, Crispy Chicken Wings, Cubano Rice Bowl, Quesadilla's, Breakfast Hashbrowns, French Toast Skillets, Banana Bread Pudding and many more great choices. Our server told us he wanted to thank us and said they'd like to invite us back sometime once he's allowed to reopen his business. Aside from being impressed by the fancy atmosphere, we'll feel totally welcomed back due to the amazing customer care received too! If I'm not mistaken, Uptown Grill is owned by Shreveport-based Soho Foods Inc., who acquired Jacks Restaurant Group, LLC. It's also another American franchise based out of Los Angeles, California. We're glad to say the ownerfounder is a native Texan named Gary Evans. He specializes in building relationships through quality hospitality services offered at affordable prices. In addition to serving delicious meals, the team at Uptown Grille strives to serve its guests with kindness throughout each experience. This includes ensuring each guest receives excellent customer service no matter whether they're visiting alone or with friends and family members. What's more, guests can choose to dine indoors using prime seating areas, or enjoy alfresco dining facilities under expansive windows when weather permits. And lastly, those fond of nutrition will love knowing most of the dishes ordered include fresh fruits and vegetables. My wife and i went downstairs to check-out from work so late. Very cold outside. It started snowing and the lights in front of me went off. Not much light left but enough for me to recognize she sat right behind me watching us leave. She turned around smiling waving her hand and held out her arms until she saw me coming into view. I didn't realize at the moment if she meant ""sneeze"" or ""embrace."" Later she revealed that yes she meant sneeze...and then embraced me. (She did seem a little tense because of the temperature.) My brain immediately jumped to thoughts of public nudities as opposed to incest between homosexual males. A quick search quickly brought up another story about a man walking home naked and having sex with a dog.... Uptown Grill is located near many popular attractions including Adirondack Park Zoo, Silver Dollar City Art Museum and Needle 'n Thread Children's Museum. Meanwhile, you'll appreciate easy access to Interstate 75 West and Southworth Boulevard. Lastly, nearby restaurants include Cork Block Kitchen Bar and Sticky Pig BBQ Pit Steakhouse. After dinner at Yard House you might want to stop by Uptown Grill for dessert. They're offering free parking for patrons staying overnight at Yard House. Southern Living magazine has identified Oak Hill Plantation Inn Bed and Breakfast as one of America's Best BBs. Here's why: ""The owners are warm, welcoming hosts, making you feel like part of the family."""

I was there for my birthday and they did not acknowledge it. I was not asked what I would like for dessert. I was not asked if I wanted a coffee. The table next to us was making a mess and they cleaned it up but did not wipe the chair we were sitting in that was sprayed with whatever they were making a mess with. The waitress was fine but not memorable. I had a similar experience at this restaurant two years ago. It's not worth the money. Wonderful food. Fantastic service. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend this restaurant. This place is fantastic. The food, service and atmosphere are all excellent. The only downside is that it's quite pricey.

BigScience,yelp-396,"This place is fantastic! Impeccable service, great atmosphere and outstanding food. Yes, it's pricey but well worth it. I've been here a couple of times and it never disappoints! I've tried the wings (both with and without sauce), calamari, lobster macaroni salad fries, pizza, a few burgers; all were spot on. I've always enjoyed my visits to this restaurant. The best part about it- it's family owned so you know you're getting authentic Italian cooking quality! As I have stated before, I've visited Pizza Romano quite often over the years since moving from near Boston MA. For me, their home cooked meals are simply delicious. Their pasta dishes and pizzas are out of this world as they use high-quality ingredients that appeal to both simple appetites andor adventurous palates alike. It seems like almost every time we go there just a small bit more is available for us to taste or try. And whenever one dish leaves our table looking incomplete, another staff member will quickly take it off the counter and fill up any blanks left behind by those who had finished eating. In addition to excellent food and friendly servers, not forgetting the amazing food prices offered at Pizza Romano are also very well received throughout most of Massachusetts. Often compared to other top rated restaurants in town, I can only say I'm sure many people would agree that Pizza Romano offers exceptional value too. But what really stands out though is how each customer feels after leaving their tables - a happy smile washes away even the smallest speckle of stress while sitting down too relaxing chair and enjoying an entire meal made solely for them in front of your eyes. Pizza Romano's sister location, located right next door, has truly become something special for its owners. They opened up a second storefront full of new offerings, including elaborate desserts such as tiramisu brownies, chocolate mousse pies - and even dairy-free options. But perhaps the most exciting thing going forward today when visiting either Pizza Romano locations is the expansion into catering services that allow you to pick whatever you want at their menu and then deliver it directly to wherever you need it delivered. This makes ordering online super easy indeed...as long as you absolutely don't mind having some guests request delivery items for themselves sometime soon! With numerous awards and accolades already coming their way, these two extremely talented entrepreneurs believe strongly that nothing could be further apart than making life better through good food and fine dining experiences versus cheap fast foods served poor tasting and tastelessly prepared according to strict industry standards. So if you think they're talking about a third restaurant...let alone four, please do remember: ""It doesn't matter where you eat because the important thing is YOU EAT"" Our goal at Midwest Lawn Service is simple: To serve the highest level of lawn care possible. We work hard to make sure that our customers' grass stays green year-round by using effective products and professional techniques. There might come a day when you notice yellow or brown patches developing under your grass blades. That means it's time for spring aeration and fertilization."

LLAMA,yelp-397,This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 82313 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to 4 tables. Food arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Waitress was very distracted and just not capable of handling so many tables. Food selection is limited. They are a small family run restaurant and are not capable of handling larger parties. Please stay away from this place.
Human,yelp-397,"This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 82313 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to handle the entire room (30 people) while her apparent sidekick was wiping down televisions. Waited 30 minutes for a drink order from the bar and 45 minutes for mediocre, COLD food. If you are drinking alcoholic beverages, you are far better off getting up and going to the bar yourself. I didn't bother complaining because I simply didn't have the time after waiting so long - and if I did, I didn't feel like waiting for a manager when they probably could care less. This place has great potential, but unfortunately it's a waste which is a sign of poor management decisions. Just shut the doors now and save yourselves the trouble. So many better choices downtown than this toilet."
Tsinghua,yelp-397,"This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 82313 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to 15 tables. She left one of the tables with 3 of our party waiting on a drink and dessert while she ran to another table to get another drink. She then returned to our table with 1 martini glass full of ice and a martini glass that was almost empty. No explanation was given and no apologies offered. I felt that the server could have handled this situation better and would have at least been apologetic. I did have a good time with the rest of my party and the food was good. This is one of the best dives in the city. My family and I visit often. The owner is very friendly and seems to be always there to make sure that the place is clean and that the food is hot. My only complaint is that the portions are a little small. You get what you pay for and if you want a good meal for a reasonable price, this is a good place to go. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for years and we love it. It is not fancy but it is clean and the food is great. It has great value for the money and the owner is always there and very friendly. It is a family run restaurant and it shows. I am sure it will be there for years to come. When we went to McFadden's, we were surprised to see how clean it was. This is one of the few restaurants in NYC that has such a clean environment. We had a table at the bar for two and our waitress was attentive and very nice. We ate at the bar, and it was nice to have the view of the stage from there. The food was very good. I recommend McFadden's for a nice night out. I ate here several times over the past 10 years. This was the first time I was disappointed. My server was not friendly and her attitude was very rude. I had a great meal but was not happy with the service. There were other customers in the restaurant and I believe that my server should have made more of an effort to please me. My friend and I ate at McFadden's last night for a celebration. The service was great. The food was good and the restaurant was really clean. We had the lamb chops, mashed potatoes and a salad. It was all good, but the lamb chops were really good. They were just a little pricey. We will definitely go back. I am a huge fan of McFadden's and I was very disappointed in the food I ordered. I wanted the chicken parmesan, it came out cold and my husband wanted the chicken pot pie. It came out cold, he tried to warm it up and it was still cold. The mashed potatoes and broccoli were just OK. My family and I went to McFadden's last night. We went to see a play at Lincoln Center. We got there early and had a wonderful time. We ordered our food and it came out very quickly. My husband and I shared a shrimp cocktail. It was very good and had a lot of shrimp. We had 3 desserts. My favorite was the banana split and it was really good. I will definitely go back and have dinner here again. This was my first time eating at McFadden's. I have heard many good things about this restaurant. I did not realize that it was located in Soho, but I really enjoyed it. The food was good and the service was great. I will definitely be back. This was my first time going to McFadden's. It was really nice and I will definitely be back. The food was great and the service was great.

The young lady who came over took an order, walked away and returned with three waters which were placed before us but never refilled after that first round despite our numerous requests! We had ordered steaks from one table as well at no extra charge yet when it come time we tipped.......the waitress then served herself instead? It just made me mad.....I should have called her out right there about how she treated my group because if you're going try serve yourself more than once during your shift - why bother serving anyone else??? In fact all servers are rude regardless......it's nothing personal or anything against their age......but they really need some trainingtraining themselves so stop being such snobs toward everone around them!!

BigScience,yelp-397,"This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 82313 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to 7 tables and would not provide any help with our set up or gatherings, other than staring at us as we tried to get things going (none of which were successful). We had several waiters approach us after dinner who refused to work it out since their shift ended that night. We even asked them if they wanted to leave early but each time someone else came in before them so there wasn't much choice! The same thing happened when table service started again around 9pm. There are more issues besides this also...there was no bread available until about 10 minutes into our reservation because nobody went downstairs to order it during our first hour of dining - thus making us miss our next courses completely! (we ordered from outside) No one served drinks unless you ask people over loudly enough so I got my glass filled 3 times by different servers in less then an hour. (I didn't realize the wine list listed prices!) I'm sure others will have similar experiences here and that's why it's important to read reviews beforehand. We took advantage of a deal very nice meal 48 per person too, pizza wings chicken salad and chips all included. Service excellent food wonderful Food was good; however, my husband received weird eyesore puffed cheese sandwich rolls that contained moldy lettuce burrata insideand he thought it was okay eating these without asking how they could taste ok-ish despite being caked with mold: (. Also tried my usual cocktail, Lemonade Mule, and found out it actually tasted like cheap lemonade w added bourbon instead of actual mint flavoring and lemons. Wouldn't recommend at all! Great atmosphere and great location near Tufts Park! Be careful though, the food can take some getting used to for those coming from traditional Italian cuisine. What You Will Get: If you're looking for authentic italian fare, don't bother ordering anything from here. You're not going to find spaghetti bolognese, tiramisu or polenta ceviche. Instead, you'll receive meatballs in garlic sauce, chicken parmesan, eggplant Parmigiana, sauteed artichokes, pasta dishes made with homemade sauces such as: penne alla vodka, or grilled meats including filet mignon, and roast beef tenderloin along with many small entrees. While serving portions may seem generous, they're meant to feed 2-3 adults easily. Aside from the aforementioned offerings, you'll find stuffed mushrooms, fresh mozzarella sticks, antipasti platters packed full of items such as ricotta balls, bruschetta, olives, tomato jam and cappelletti. You'll also encounter lasagne entrees, ravioli risotto and cannelloni-like tortellini soup.

For more than 14 years, the owners of Cafe Forte have tirelessly made a name for themselves by providing a large range of freshly roasted coffee and other drinks. The coffee here is strong. I'm sure they would provide a coffee that suits your taste, however, I ordered my coffee 'long' and the result was a coffee that gave me a powerful kick. The owner informed me that the coffee beans he uses are organic beans from a local source. The coffee beans are roasted on the premises and you can see the large roasting machine through the window in the cafe. The owners pride themselves on providing freshly roasted coffee to their customers. The coffee machine is a large, beautiful Italian designed machine. The coffee was excellent. There is a large range of coffee and tea on offer. For the coffee connoisseur, I am sure you will find a blend of coffee that will suit your taste. The decor of the cafe is a little unusual. It has a frenchitalian feel to it with beautiful chandeliers, antique furniture and an ornate fireplace. The owners have incorporated some of their own furniture into the decor and there is a small collection of oriental artwork on display. Out the back of the cafe is a small courtyard and garden, with a cute little sandstone water feature. There are a few wooden tables and chairs under the shade of a pergola. This space is used by the locals, who are able to bring their dogs with them. This is a pleasant area to sit and enjoy a coffee or drink. Cafe Forte has a beautiful feel about it and the owners are very friendly. The coffee is strong and the drinks are well made.

One of their signature dishes is the Cafe Meatloaf with a light burgundy sauce and smashed potatoes. They also feature many fresh seafood entrees as well as fine Italian specialties. Because the restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, on Main Street, just east of Goldwater Blvd, you can enjoy the works of fine artists as well as the fine foods at Cafe Forte. I recommend beginning your meal with the baked brie and sliced apples along with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. Casual atmosphere with little votives and a fresh flower on each table is what you will see when you first enter the main dining room. There is a bar area and when weather permits, an intimate garden for romantic dining. They also do amazing pies and tortes for dessert.

Bowling Green's own Gino's Upper East Side Pizzeria was featured as one of the top 10 pizza restaurants on Fast Company's list of America's favorite businesses last year (and continues to receive rave reviews from regular customers).

The pizzeria offers wood-fired pizzas along with pasta dishes and salads plus they also serve lunch and dinner seven days per week. Alongside using organic produce whenever possible, Gino prides itself on preparing all his freshly baked bread daily - which makes everything else you order even better! There are plenty of bowling greens out there where diners can enjoy authentic Mexican street fare but none compare to Chuy's Southwest Kitchen Bar. Located just minutes away from downtown Chicago, this casual dining spot serves comforting southern classics like seafood casseroles, brisket sandwiches, enchiladas, margaritas, burritos, chicken wings and so much more while maintaining an appealing vibe that's perfect for large gatherings.

The only complaint that we had was a very stingy water station system on Saturday morning while everyone waited in line; they would barely give you two cups of ice cold tapwater per person before running out and closing up shop! Luckily as soon after opening them were giving us free bottles upon checkout (as if our flights weren't expensive enough!). On Sunday however things seemed much more organised with consistent bottled waters being given automatically without any queueing involved whatsoever - although this wasn' t really explained either by anyone until later into check-in which meant some people got an extra bottle or just gave their empty one away because noone told those passengers about what happened earlier:. We did get three meals each during both days also... The food itself came from Soussan who has been doing amazing stuff since he started here back 20089 . It felt great having him work all over again especially cos hes such awesome dude overall too He always knows how many vegans are coming through his kitchens even years down time between visits!!! For me personally i love going vegan mainly due its health benefits etc..but like most folks around planet earth have done throughout history humans tend not look past 'their meat'. Having said thaat tho im sure keto type diets will be popularized way faster than plant based ones? Not ruling anything completely off course... But think seriously once these rich nations start figuring shitout -especially countries where population figures aren'tafected drastically (im talking hundreds) then hopefully thats gonna change:) no matterwhat diet u go onto!!"

Human,yelp-401,"Don't believe the hype! I won't say this place is awful, but it's nothing to write home about. I heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of forgot about it. It resurfaced in my mind a few days ago, and I just had to try it. Maybe I expected too much? I ordered the baked chicken. with the mac and cheese. Don't expect to just walk in and get your food in a minute or two. You'll be waiting a few, especially if they are busy. It's completely worth it though... the food was still steaming by the time I got to my house in the Aliante area. I was impressed. My order consisted of baked chicken with honey mustard and BFG sauce, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was fine. Nothing that I couldn't prepare myself. The mac and cheese was completely disappointing! It looks so good from the pictures I've seen, but it was complete bland. A soupy mac and cheese covered in cheese. Boring! The best thing on my plate was the honey mustard sauce. That's kinda sad.... The service is awesome. The staff is really friendly! I think I paid just under 7 bucks, which really wasn't bad. I just wish the good was better."

I was expecting something really special, but it was just...meh. The food is okay, but it's not anything to write home about. The service is fine, but it's not anything to write home about. The atmosphere is nice, but it's not anything to write home about. Overall, BFG is just a pretty average place. It's not bad, but it's not great either. If you're looking for something really special, I would recommend going somewhere else. Here are some specific things I didn't like about BFG:  The food was just okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  The service was fine, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  The atmosphere was nice, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  The prices were a bit high.  The location was a bit inconvenient. Overall, I would not recommend BFG to anyone. There are much better places to eat in the city."

I heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of expected it to be amazing based on all the hype. However, the reality didn't quite live up to my expectations. The food was decent, but not outstanding, and the service was slow and unprofessional. The atmosphere was also lacking, with a generic, sterile feel to the place. So, while I wouldn't say don't go there, I also wouldn't recommend it as a must-visit spot."
BigScience,yelp-401,"Don't believe the hype! I won't say this place is awful, but it's nothing to write home about. I heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of forgot it until last weekend when my wife told me she'd tried there for her birthday. It was pretty good. The restaurant serves American cuisine with an Asian twist. The foods at Garden Oasis are seasoned well (like no other Chinese restaurants) and freshly prepared on site every night by experienced chefs who have been in China long enough that they know exactly what each dish should taste like. (Another great feature: you can choose which part of your food comes first...the sauce or the meat.) We ordered spicy pork ribs - we asked for medium rare; came out nice tender without being pink inside - served with steamed jasmine rice and vegetables. They were very reasonably priced too - 16 per plate."

But I figured it was a tourist trap. When I heard about the free BFG Pass I decided to give it a try. They had some decent sales going on, so I figured why not? I was ready to give it a try. I ordered the 12 hour pass. When I arrived I was asked for my 4 digit pin number. I got a 30 minute free demo, which was good. I saw a few of the attractions, but I was disappointed. I tried to talk to the other guests in the demo, but they were nowhere to be found. I then asked for my 4 digit pin number. I was told I would have to come back in 30 minutes. I thought I was joking. I then asked what the attraction was. I was told it was ""The Basement."" I was told I could come back for it at my leisure. I then decided I was not going to waste my time. I didn't have to wait 30 minutes. I walked around and took a look at the other attractions. There was nothing to do. I went back to the front desk and asked about the BFG Pass. They told me it was no longer available. I asked if I could just pay for the 12 hour pass, and they told me no. I then asked if I could just pay for a one hour pass. I was told I could. I paid for the one hour pass and left. I was not impressed. I had heard all these great things about BFG, and I'm sorry to say it's nothing to write home about."

When you finally meet the crazy uncle, he's not as crazy as you thought he was. He's just a guy who loves to crack jokes and tell stories. The food is good, and the beer is average. If you're looking for the ""best fried chicken in New York,"" you'll be disappointed. It's not bad, but it's not the best. The fried chicken at Sweet Chick and Jollibee are both better, and the macaroni and cheese at Jollibee is also better. I would go to Sweet Chick over BFG any day of the week. I just don't see the hype. The best fried chicken in the city. The wait staff is a bit slow, but the food is worth the wait! I got the fried chicken sandwich, and it was so good that I had to go back for more the next day! The fried chicken is so crunchy and flavorful, and the sandwich itself is so big that I had to take half of it home with me. The beer selection is also great. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes fried chicken. Just moved to the area and discovered this place. I was so excited to get some fried chicken and waffles, but unfortunately the waffles were cold and chewy. Not sure if it was an off day, but I think I'll have to find a new fried chicken and waffles spot."

Tsinghua,yelp-402,"To give it two stars is being generous. I don't even feel like reviewing this place. The only reason we had so much fun being here is because we ignored the rude bartender and played darts instead. It was nice to be able to do something fun that we didn't have to think about! The food was also really good. We had the vegetarian platter and I had a soup. I have no idea what it was but it was good! We also had to buy some 27 bottles of wine from a grocery store, because the liquor store would not give us wine for 12 a bottle. We spent the whole night walking around the city because we didn't want to spend the money to stay in the hotel. We spent most of our time just walking around and having fun. The only downside to this place is that there are not enough chairs for everyone to sit at. We sat at the bar and then there were two people in front of us. There was no way for them to sit down so we were forced to stand. It was uncomfortable because we were in a public place and we were all wearing jeans and jackets. It wasn't very nice of the people in front of us to make us stand. I really liked this place and it was fun to be there. It was the first time that we went out to a bar and actually had fun. I will definitely be back to this place because it was a great night! Monday, October 21, 2014 A few weeks ago, we were invited to a birthday party at a local restaurant called 1100 Oyster Bar. We were super excited because it was the first time that we went to this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great! The restaurant was decorated very nicely and had a really nice atmosphere. We had a really great time there! It was also the first time that we were able to use our coupon for 10 off food. We were able to enjoy some of the delicious food that was on their specials menu. We also had a 30 minute ""happy hour"" so we got to enjoy the 3 wine specials. We also had a lot of fun playing darts. They had a dartboard in the bar area that was just a few feet from where we were sitting. The only downside to this place is that there is no music. It was a little loud but we were used to it because we go to bars and clubs a lot. We didn't really mind it because it was just an all-around good night! Saturday, October 19, 2014 Last night, we went to the Taste of the Village to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. We went to the one in Spring Grove because we are so close to it. It was a really good event! We got to see a lot of vendors and taste some delicious food. It was also the first time that we tried the blue corn dog. It was really good! I don't think I've ever had a blue corn dog before so it was really good to try it. The blue corn is really sweet and the corn dogs are very good. We also got to try some ""freaky"" food that we've never tried before. We had the 1200 Island Platter which had clams, lobster, shrimp, mussels, and corn on the cob. It was delicious! We also had the Superfreaky S'mores which was also delicious! It had graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate chips, and whipped cream. It was very good! We also got to see a lot of really cool food trucks. We tried the Food Truck Thursday food truck and it was really good! We got the hot pretzel and the pizza with jalapenos. The pretzel was really good because it was soft and hot. The pizza was also really good because it had a lot of cheese. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the jalapenos didn't have much flavor. They just had a little bit of heat but nothing too crazy. We also got to try some other food trucks that were there. We tried the Honeybee Hot Wings which was really good! They had the grilled honey butter wings and the buffalo wings. The buffalo wings were very good and the honey butter wings were very good too. They also had a food truck that made delicious churros. We had the blueberry cheese churros which were really good! They had all different kinds of flavors like chocolate, strawberry, and coffee. They also had a food truck that made great onion rings. They had the chicken and waffles onion rings which were really good! We also had the Nutty Fudge Brownie which was really good! It had a lot of nuts and fudge and it was very good. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that it was a little too sweet."

The ventilation is not very good and if you're there for hours, maybe you'll just get used to the stench. 2.) The receptionist was not helpful, condescending, and acted like helping us was too much out of the way. Probably just got used to regulars and is very nice to them. But to newbies, forget it. My cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor. He just wasn't worth the time to be given good service to I think.

And when my wife wanted to get off her phone and into conversation with other patrons in front of us, she just wouldn't be able to do that. Service could have been better as well - no one at all came up or helped us out. We were more than happy with what we ordered though! We are very glad you enjoyed your visit! We really appreciate everyone's feedback. As a rule, if an employee hasn't come by to answer questions about anything specific during service there may be something wrong going on within the kitchenbar area. That doesn't necessarily mean the employees aren't doing good work...we hope you'll consider coming back soon! Loved the decor setting. Parking was difficult throughout the Friday night weekend; plenty of parking options nearby. Our waitress did accommodate us somewhat despite having limited knowledge of local dining establishments but overall experience left me feeling unappreciated..... Megan from Topeka called us before our reservation time to confirm our arrival. She made sure to let us know where our chairs would be and also said to bring any specials papers around so we'd know when promotions ran. Very helpful. Our server was wonderful!!!

Be sure to go to the (free) bird feedings and pet the sting rays! See the zoo animals first because the zoo closes before the aquarium. Bring plenty of water with you because this place is bigger than it appears. There are a few water fountains near the buildings (north side of the park) with ice cold water that taste good, so you can refill a bottle there. The water fountains on the south side are in the sun and hot. The restrooms are large and pretty clean too. One thing I didn't like was cups and plastic (water) bottles all over the place. Clean up the trash. There is a great restaurant called Dillions BBQ on site and provides a great place to get out of the sun, soak up some AC, and chow down on some really good food. You can even request to sit right next to a giant shark tank! The aquarium's AC is set in the mid 70s, so these are buildings that are nice to see when it's real hot. Bring walking shoes, water and sunblock. Also, enjoy the free air show that the fighter jets from Luke Air Force base seem to put on as they practice overhead."

I also learned about the Aboriginal people who live in Australia. Next, I visited the African Plains exhibit, where I saw lions, elephants, giraffes, and zebras. I was able to get up close to the animals and learn about their habitats. I then visited the Polar Bear Plunge, where I saw polar bears swimming and playing in their icy pool. I also learned about the threats that polar bears face due to climate change. After that, I visited the Tropical Rainforest, where I saw monkeys, snakes, and birds. I was able to walk through the rainforest and experience the sights and sounds of the jungle. I ended my day at the Children's Zoo, where my kids had a blast playing with the animals. We saw goats, pigs, and chickens, and we even got to pet a pony. We also learned about how to take care of animals and how to be kind to them. Overall, I had a great experience at the San Diego Zoo. I learned a lot about different animals and their habitats, and I had a lot of fun exploring the zoo. I would definitely recommend visiting the San Diego Zoo if you're ever in the area. Here are some additional details about the San Diego Zoo:  The zoo is home to over 3,700 animals from all over the world.  The zoo is divided into 12 different areas, each of which is dedicated to a specific region of the world.  The zoo is open year-round, but the best time to visit is during the spring or fall.

Human,yelp-404,"When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time. After speaking to the manager, we decided to try it out. I placed an order for a less spicy pico de gallo and when it came it burned the roof of my mouth. I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla! Normally love Mexican food but am for sure going to skip this place next time."

There were many other people waiting also. The thing is that you cannot find any Mexican restaurants with green chile sauce here because there are no suitable plant-based foods for this kind of sauces. I found one restaurant where it makes sense but they don't make tacos from scratch so it's still another step away from what I'm used too plus there's only 2 small tables available: There is only 1 pizza chain serving up vegan pizzas (and yes cheese!) which is awesome:) Hopefully the city will grow more as soon as possible! I've read your story and now i feel like i'm going to be sick after reading all the photos...we have some mexican restaurants near me, though i never went into them coz its always crowded haha!"

We saw some vegan options and gluten free, but it was not easy to figure out what was vegan or gluten free. It was very expensive. We heard the owner or manager was upset that the waitresses were taking too long to serve the food and he was yelling at them. One of the girls was in tears and I wanted to hug her.

It can be frustrating when restaurant staff are not knowledgeable about food ingredients, but it's important to keep in mind that not everyone may have the same level of dietary restrictions or concerns. It's good that they were willing to consult with the chef and make sure your dietary needs were met. If you have any further concerns, you can always reach out to the restaurant directly or look up their menu online to see if they list any allergy or dietary information."

We went to another spot and had a better experience. Just because a place is famous does not mean that it is good. Very disappointed with the service and the food. The service was very slow. I had a drink and asked if I could have a sandwich for lunch and the waitress asked me to wait 15 minutes and then came back to ask if I still wanted it. I was not sure if she had misunderstood my request or if I had said something wrong. They didn't have a lot of vegetarian options, but the cheese enchiladas were very good. I think I'll go back and try the chicken enchiladas. This was the first time I've had a bad experience at a restaurant here. A friend and I had dinner at this place and were disappointed. We got seated, the food came out really quickly, and the waitress came over and told us the portions were huge. I ordered the taco and the other had the burrito. The portions were huge, but the food was very bland. I ordered a tostada and a small beer, and it was just over 10. The waitress was not very friendly, but she did come over and ask if everything was ok. She could have been nicer. I had to ask for the check twice because they didn't come out until the food was all gone. When we got to the car, I realized my friend forgot his wallet. I went back to the restaurant and they let me have it for 15, but I was in such a hurry that I forgot to give him the change. I don't know if it was because we were from out of town or what, but they weren't very friendly. I would say that this is a good restaurant, but the service needs to be better.

PaLM,yelp-404,"When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold and transferred to 3 different people who did not know either. Then, when we arrived, we were seated in a room that was dark and had no windows. It was stifling hot and we were sweating. The waitress was very friendly and recommended the fish tacos. They were delicious. However, the rice and beans were very oily and bland. The margarita was also very good. The service was very slow and we waited over an hour for our food. Overall, it was not a great experience."

OpenAI,yelp-405,Outstanding place to eat. Very affordable and far better than Subway. Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Thank you for the recommendation! Can you share the name of the restaurant and its location?
Tsinghua,yelp-405,"Outstanding place to eat. Very affordable and far better than Subway. Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Waiter was friendly and courteous. A little lite on the seating area but overall I would go back. A 5 minute drive from the Museum and close to the river. Excellent. No reservations needed, no line, very friendly and efficient staff."
BigScience,yelp-405,"Outstanding place to eat. Very affordable and far better than Subway. Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. They have pretty much everything you can think of from Mexican food, sushi, pizza etc... They are really doing a great job at making sure their prices stay low while still putting out quality food. I love your picture, it makes me want to go there! I never stop going back for my favorite pita breads! The spicy fries were incredible (very lightly fried), the nachos with cheddar cheese was very good as well Love this place!!! I always go here when in the area..definately one of our favorites!! The fresh made tortilla chips are amazing!! Our family loves this mexican spot!!!! Great food extremely friendly staff that will make any meal special!!! This is America's most popular fast-food chain restaurant which sells tacos and burritos along with other dishes such as: wraps, salads and soups.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-405,"Outstanding place to eat. Very affordable and far better than Subway. Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Good service - friendly but not pushy or over-exuberant like some places I have been in the past (especially at airports). Plenty of seating space available even on busier daystimes, unlike other chains that seem nearly full most times with no possibility for additional seats being added unless you leave after eating your meal! The staff members are always efficient helping out where needed without imposing themselves upon customers too much May we take a picture?', 'Would this help?' etc), while still making sure they're serving all their tables quickly enough so as never be left waiting long behind anyone else's order if others need particular attention when placing theirs.) 5 stars overall plus 100 would return here again just because how good it is:) Only 1 bad thing about my recent visit was there were only 2 elderly people asked ahead who ordered something from our table which made us feel very uncomfortable haha...but otherwise everything great..:)"
BigScience,yelp-406,"For some reason, I really thought I reviewed this already?? Any who! I just recently brought some family members here. Wife and I have been here three other occasions. The first time we were staying for a wedding at the hotel but it was a special day so there are many pictures from that event. Our second trip to Fairfield Inn Suites by Marriott Hadley was when my wife had her birthday which you can see in these previous posts. My third visit with our children and grandchildren (my sisters) was also last week. These two girls and their families stayed once again because of Mother's Day weekend here in Colorado. I'm sure they all enjoyed themselves! This week I've created an outfit post about what I wore on Thursday night. It is ugly Christmas sweater weather...too cold outside even though it's only February! This year has not started out too bad yet and while January was slow - much slower than usual due to COVID restrictions- Feburary seems to be pretty busy as well especially around Valentine's Day. It's definitely going to get more hectic as March takes over;). I'm wearing one of my favorite oversized sweaters right now. You probably saw me mention how often I wear this sweater before..I love it so much!! When I got married 10 years ago, it was this same sweater I wore back then, today it looks brand new!! The pants are super comfortable since they are made up of spandex material. They are a slim fit style with pockets on each side. To keep warm during winter season, I always pack a thick fleece jacket or scarf whenever I'm traveling like this weekend:)."

Or an area were some of us men would like to set back, watch some games, drink some beer, and eat. They do have a small area by the Keno area, but it's not much.

Tsinghua,yelp-406,"For some reason, I really thought I reviewed this already?? Any who! I just recently brought some family members here. Wife and I have been here three other occasions. The most recent time was in November, and it was our first time to visit the fam. We have all visited here before, but we had never had a chance to visit together. Since we had family there, we decided to take a day to go. I knew we would have a long wait for our table, so I decided to order lunch for the table. We sat down at the table and started chatting with the staff. It was obvious that they are family, and that they love this place. We sat there for about an hour and a half, and it was not a long wait. I ordered the whole chicken, the sides, and the fries. My wife ordered the blackened chicken, and the sides. The whole chicken was cooked perfectly. The skin was crispy, but not burnt. It was tender and juicy. The sauce was delicious. The sides were also cooked perfectly. I had a little problem with the fries. The first time I tried them, they were soft and not cooked. I told the waiter, and he said he would bring some extra to cook. They were still soft and not cooked, so he brought some extra. They were cooked after that. My wife said the same thing. The blackened chicken was great. I liked the spiciness of it. The sides were delicious. We both liked the flavor of the fries. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone."
LLAMA,yelp-406,"For some reason, I really thought I reviewed this already?? Any who! I just recently brought some family members here. Wife and I have been here three other occasions. The first was our anniversary. The service is slow, but the food is awesome. My brother ordered the chicken wings and my sister ordered the vegetable patties. Both are good options. I ordered the fried jerk chicken, which is to die for. The jerk is not too spicy, so it doesn't overpower the chicken. My wife ordered the curry chicken and it was amazing. The curry flavor is not overpowering, which is the way we like it. We order the fried plantains and sweet potatoes every time. It is the perfect compliment to the flavors of the meals. I will say, the service is slow, but that's because it is fresh, homemade food. The fried jerk chicken is worth the wait. I definitely recommend this place, but don't go in a rush. The food and atmosphere is awesome! My wife and I were in town for my brother's graduation. We had a little time to kill before the ceremony, so we decided to stop in here. I've never been here before, but I've heard great things about it. We were seated pretty quickly. The waitress, upon asking, was very knowledgeable about the food and the seasonings. For the appetizer, I decided to go with the coconut shrimp. It was different. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. The coconut flavor wasn't overpowering. The sweet chili sauce was a perfect compliment. The shrimp wasn't greasy or oily. For our meals, I decided to go with the Surf and Turf. It is a perfect combination. The ribeye is cooked to perfection and the jerk chicken was full of flavor. My wife ordered the salmon, which was also cooked well. I was a little disappointed in the flavor of the salmon. The pineapple salsa was a great compliment to it. Overall, the service was good. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. The food was good. I will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu. My wife and I have been here a couple of times. We were at the Lowry Air Force Base for the day and decided to stop here. It's a cute little place that has a variety of food. The staff is friendly and the service is pretty quick. We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. I decided to go with the fish tacos. They were different. It was two tacos, but the meat was a little dry. The fish was a little dry as well. The lime and cilantro made it a little more bearable. My wife ordered the quesadilla and she enjoyed it. The cheese wasn't stringy or greasy. It was very good. Overall, the food was good, but a little pricey. The service was good, but the waitress seemed a little frazzled."
Tsinghua,yelp-407,"I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years. Not sure what happened or if I had better memories of this place than what it really was. When I was in school, we all were told that this was a good school and it was one of the best in the area. I'm sure that's true, but there are a lot of things that could be improved. The teachers here are very nice and very dedicated to their jobs, but they need to be better with the students. Some students have no respect for others and don't even have the basic decency to let their friends finish their lunch. Some of the teachers need to be better with the students.

PaLM,yelp-407,"I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years. Not sure what happened or if I had better memories of this place than what it really was. I remembered it as being a warm and welcoming place, but now it just seemed cold and empty. Maybe it was because I was different now, or maybe it was because the place had changed. Either way, it wasn't the same place I remembered. I walked around the block, taking in the sights and sounds of the neighborhood. It had changed a lot in the past 5 years. There were new businesses on the street, and the houses looked different. It was like a whole new world. I stopped in front of my old house. It was still there, but it looked different too. The paint was peeling, and the yard was overgrown. It looked like no one had lived there in a long time. I stood there for a moment, trying to remember the good times I had there. I remembered playing in the backyard with my friends, and having sleepovers with my cousins. I remembered the Christmas parties and the Fourth of July celebrations. But those memories were all in the past. Now, this house was just a reminder of a time that was gone. I turned and walked away, feeling a sense of loss. I knew I would never be able to go back to that time, and that made me sad. But I also knew that I had to move on. I had to make new memories, and create a new life for myself. So I took a deep breath and walked away, leaving my old life behind me."
OpenAI,yelp-407,"I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years. Not sure what happened or if I had better memories of this place than what it really was I'm sorry to hear you're feeling uncertain about your return to this place. It's possible that your memories of the place may have been idealized or that things have changed since you were last here. However, it's also possible that there are still things to enjoy and appreciate about this place. If you are open to it, perhaps you could try exploring it with fresh eyes and an open mind to see what it has to offer now. Additionally, it may be helpful to reflect on what drew you to this place in the past and see if those reasons still resonate with you."
BigScience,yelp-407,"I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years. Not sure what happened or if I had better memories of this place than what it really was but the one thing I know is that my family and me have never looked forward to leaving. The comments you made about their music were right on...the songs are just so good, they don't need much else. They play a lot of different styles of music, including some not-so-good stuff (sometimes)...but as long as they're playing great tunes it doesn't matter! My second opinion is yes, as far as I'm concerned too many people in any field become mere cogs, shuffling around like robots while trying to be heard by everyone because that's all anybody wants."
Human,yelp-407,"I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years.

I was so disgusted by the sugar cookie I bought I ate half of it and threw the rest out. Hubby's ginger molasses was pure sugar and didn't taste like like ginger or molasses...just sugar with some flour in it. The chocolate chip cookie also was so sickeningly sweet. Not sure what happened with their cookies, but they went so far sweet they're inedible. I won't even start on the turkey sandwich I ordered. It was terrible as well. Maybe I got to the place on a bad day, but when I come back to AZ again, I will make sure to skip Paradise Bakery...it was not a paradise kind of hit for me."

BigScience,yelp-408,"Not sure what all the hype is about, but it's definitely not worth the hour wait outside. My group had wristbands and were on some sort of guest list, but no one ever came by to see if we needed anything except for a few minutes before closing. I read this review last week and decided that I would try it out because I was curious (and also just want an experience). We arrived after visiting another festival earlier in the day so when our food truck rolled up there wasn't much left from ORCHID FRONT! They did have something left at KING OF THE ROCKS though which I forgot about until my husband asked me where we'd been eating yesterday and i mentioned NOTHING was open yet. So...granted it took us longer than usual around 2 hours to get dinner but hey - i'm happy with THAT! The main reason why I didn't go back again was because they only offered half of their menu through the booths - you can't order hot dogs or hamburgers between 12pm-2am. But other than that everything else about the vibe of the place and how funky AND cool everyone is- i'm totally going back!! We drove down here today and spent two grueling hours looking at every booth.. the lineup seemed thinner then last year. The music sucked.... A bunch of reggaeton rock n' roll bands playing as if they are still living at Miami Vice era dancing dresses.. LOL.... everyone's really excited right now. No idea what we'll be doing tomorrow night....we've had enough carnage We went to Orchid Front last weekend and my boyfriend ordered the tacos, and while he thought them good said nothing special about his."
LLAMA,yelp-408,"Not sure what all the hype is about, but it's definitely not worth the hour wait outside. My group had wristbands and were on some sort of guest list, but the staff was adamant that they were going to make us wait outside anyways. I am baffled, as to how such a place can be so exclusive and still give off such a pretentious vibe. Inside, the layout is unpleasant and the flow was very poorly designed. The decor, although nice, was also confusing. They tried to combine elements from different eras and it just didn't work. I also felt that the lighting was too dim for a place that was supposed to be a nightclub. The DJ was good, but nothing more than just average for any other club. We left after 20 minutes and didn't bother coming back. I have been to this place numerous times for various events and was never disappointed. Food is very good, and the service is excellent. Very friendly staff, and the ambiance is nice. The reason why I gave this place a 45, was because the location is horrible. It's really hard to find parking and there is only a tiny parking lot. When they have parties, it gets very crowded and the parking lot becomes a nightmare. I would still recommend this place to anyone. Just be prepared for the parking issues. I really wanted to like this place, but after visiting twice, I have decided to never return. The decor is a bit dated, the waiters are not very friendly, and the service is poor. I went with a large group for dinner and a few of us ordered chicken curry. When it arrived, it was not what we expected. We asked the waiter if we could send it back, but he said that the kitchen was very busy and could not remake the order. We didn't want to make a big scene, so we just ate what we got. My group also ordered some dishes to be shared family style. The waiter forgot to bring them and we had to ask him twice to bring them. When he finally did, we were half way through our meal. I was also shocked at how the waiters were treating other diners. I witnessed one waiter slap a plate down in front of a guest and then tell them that they could not get an item that they had asked for because the kitchen was too busy. I was surprised at how unprofessional the staff was and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Tsinghua,yelp-408,"Not sure what all the hype is about, but it's definitely not worth the hour wait outside. My group had wristbands and were on some sort of guest list, but there were people outside waiting at least 3 hours before we got in. So don't waste your time. I've never seen a better display than this. I have 2 younger brothers and my sister in law and it was a treat for all of us to be able to see the fireworks in person. The weather was perfect and we were able to watch from the waterfront. It was awesome. The displays are spectacular. The boats have great sights, and the noise is incredible. It's worth it to wait in line, but you do have to be prepared to be cold. Bring warm clothes and bring a coat. You'll be freezing! The fireworks are very impressive, and we were on the water side of the river, so we could hear them loud and clear. The boat trip itself is very nice and is worth the wait. They will let you know when the fireworks are coming, and you can watch them from the boat. If you're lucky, you might get to see the dolphins. The fireworks display is worth the trip. It was cold but very worth it. We went on the 4th of July and the weather was perfect. The line was long but not too bad. They give you a number to hang onto and they will let you in a few at a time. The boat trip is very worth it. It was a nice day and it was nice to get out of the city. The only downside is that you don't get to see the actual fireworks. They just show the display from the boat."

The club itself was pretty small and crowded, and the music was so loud that it was hard to talk to anyone. We ended up leaving after only an hour because it was just too much. I've been to other clubs in the city that are much better than this one. They're usually bigger, with more space to dance and move around. The music is also usually more varied, so you can find something to your taste. And most importantly, the wait times are usually much shorter. I would not recommend this club to anyone. There are much better options out there."

The video production quality wasn't too great either; they could've done better given their budget! Another traveler also mentioned: ""The food options are really limited within this conference space."" And as another noted - ""Went last year - terrible experience."""

Why?...I really don't know. When we finally did get in, half my group of about 20 were already pissed off, not because of the wait, but because of the rude, power-tripping bouncersecurity guys out front. While waiting to get my handstamped, I saw the bouncer push some girl just because the tip of her 2nd toe had crossed the velvet rope. So not worth it, but if you're gonna bother, have a drink or 2 before so you're immune to the long wait and rude bouncers."

I paid 30 dollars for what I got, and I wish I could get my money back. I was excited to come back to this hotel, as I stayed here a few years ago when it was a Marriott, and it was great. Now it's a Sheraton, and I'm afraid it's terrible. the food was very good and the service was excellent. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is very expensive. for me, it's a special place for special occasions. if i could afford to eat here every week, i would. Great place to eat at. The food was great and service was great. I would recommend everyone to come and enjoy the experience. The coffee was great. If you're looking for a great breakfast buffet then this is the place to go. We visited on a weekday morning and had no issues with it being too busy, there was plenty of seating and the buffet didn't look at all like it had been picked over. The cost of the buffet was a bit on the high side, but it was all you can eat and there were many items to choose from. I have been going to The Garden Court for 30 years for breakfast with my mother. We have always enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the service. The new owners have changed the way the buffet is served, the food is still good but the service has changed. We are no longer greeted and served when we arrive. The hostess will show you to your seat and leave you there. You have to walk up to the buffet and get your own food. The new owner is now serving food from the kitchen as well as the buffet, which means if you do not arrive within the first hour and a half of opening they will be out of items on the buffet. The new owner has decided to take the old garden court down and renovate it. I am not sure what is happening to the fountain in the middle of the restaurant. He has not kept up with the garden outside of the restaurant so it is all dying. I feel it will be a very sad day when we no longer have a place to go for our special breakfasts with my mother. I had the Sunday brunch. There was a good variety of foods and some of it was very good. I can't say the same about the omelets. I had ordered a vegetarian omelet and when it arrived the cook had put ham in it. When I told him I ordered a vegetarian omelet he removed the ham. It was a good thing that I told him it had ham in it because he didn't ask me if I wanted ham in my omelet. All in all the food was good. My problem was with the hostess. When I arrived I asked to be seated by the window. She told me they were all reserved. I didn't see anyone sitting in the window seats so I asked to be seated there. She told me they were all reserved. I then asked her how they could be all reserved when no one was sitting there. She told me they were all reserved. I then asked to speak to a manager. She told me she was the manager. I told her I wanted to speak to someone who was in charge. She then told me she was in charge. She then walked away from me. I waited a few minutes then I went to the front of the restaurant and asked to see the manager. I was then seated by a window. I would recommend the Garden Court but if you have to deal with the manager be prepared to be treated rudely. We were here for the Sunday brunch buffet. It was very good. The service was excellent. The only negative is that it was very noisy. We had dinner here last night and were impressed. The food was very good and the service was very attentive. The restaurant was very busy but the wait staff was up to the task and very professional. I'm sure we'll be back to eat here. The food was very good but they were out of some items on the buffet. I've been to the Garden Court many times, but the last few years it hasn't been quite the same. The food is still good, but the wait staff is no longer as attentive and there is no longer the same variety of items on the buffet."

We sit around and sing loudly until the kids fall asleep then take them outside into the cold alone. That way they wake up happy knowing mommy daddy are still together! I know this sounds strange or maybe even scary because that's what happened last year. My husband got a beer bottle stuck under his head-he was trying to eat dinner by himself as he didn't want to disturb me. He yelled, ""Help!!!""

The Golden Nugget, by far, has been my favourite place to go to... it's very much a home away from home for us... Yea, its off the strip... and I LOVE it... Not as many drunken frat boys, with backwards baseball hats yelling wooooo wooooo!! Granted, it gets more and more like that, towards the evening, when the light show thing starts happening... (which I find completely dumb, but whatever gets the masses to stare at the ceiling and drool, because some various lights are going on and off makes them happy, more power to the drones!) Anyways, back to the golden nugget... I love this place. We booked the Gold tower room... the TV in the bathroom mirror RULES... nothing like doing my morning business and being able to watch C-Span... Also, the room, which I thought was going to be a touch bigger, is still great. The bed is comfy... Its just a very nice and relaxing room. The pool was great... However, be careful of floating vomit... No, seriously... I swam into it once... and how is it that with how many people were in that pool, no one noticed some drunk person BARFING in the pool... Yuck! Besides the above incident, I love this place... They treat you well there... We decided on staying an extra night. We are planning another trip there this summer. I cant wait."

Tsinghua,yelp-411,"I've been to Vegas many times, and stayed both on the strip, and off the strip. The Golden Nugget, by far, has been my favourite place to go to... it's a real dive bar, and it's the one place in Vegas where you can find good live music, and good food, and the rooms are surprisingly affordable, considering the location. The Golden Nugget is located right on the corner of 33rd and Fremont Street, just a few blocks from the strip, and just a few blocks from the Fremont Street Experience. It's a long, narrow strip of bars, restaurants, and casinos, that's also home to a fair number of celebrities. It's a pretty big place, but it's well-organized, and they have a great deal of things to do. One of the things that I really like about this hotel is that it's just a block away from the Fremont Street Experience. This is an area that is open from early evening until late at night, and there are lots of shows, and food, and bars. The Fremont Street Experience is actually made up of a number of buildings, and each building has a different theme. For example, one building is dedicated to sports, and one building is dedicated to sports memorabilia, and another is dedicated to celebrities. Each building is themed, and you can walk from one building to the next. There are a number of different shows, and food options, and there's a ""wet market"" that's open on the street, and there's a huge street fair that's open all day, every day. If you like sports, and you like to go out and see shows, and you like to eat, then this is the place for you. And it's right on the corner of 33rd and Fremont Street. If you're going to go to Vegas, and you're not staying at the Golden Nugget, then you're probably not going to have the best time. If you're going to Vegas, and you're staying at the Golden Nugget, then you're probably going to have a great time. You're just a block away from the Fremont Street Experience, and there are lots of things to do. There are several different shows that you can see, and there's a wide variety of food, and you can walk from one building to the next, and you can see all of the different shows, and you can eat all of the different food options. It's a really good place to stay, and it's a really good place to go. 5 out of 5 1 traveler found this helpful Was this review helpful?YesNo Replies Review Link: Stay at the Golden Nugget in Vegas Posted by Robert B on 07162015 Rating: 151 LAS VEGAS, NV Just one word to describe this hotel....UNFIT! This is not a hotel for the people who have a very limited budget. I think this hotel is an abject failure. Beware of the poor food quality, the very expensive parking, and the rude staff. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. I think the hotel is more like a Motel 6 with a casino attached. This hotel is about as good as the hotels that are in downtown Vegas. I hope the management at the Golden Nugget realizes how bad they have made themselves look with their terrible service and poor quality. I would never stay here again. Stay at the Bellagio, The Mirage, The Venetian, or The MGM Grand. 2 out of 2 1 traveler found this helpful Was this review helpful?YesNo Replies Review Link: Terrible Stay Posted by Thermidor on 06102015 Rating: 151 LAS VEGAS, NV I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas, including the Hilton, the Sheraton, the Caesars Palace, the Venetian, the Mirage, the Luxor, the Paris, the MGM Grand, and the Bellagio. This was the worst experience I have ever had. First, the check in. I checked in at 11am, and was told that the room was ready at 2pm. I was told that I would have to wait 2 hours, but that they would put me in a room in the casino. I asked why, and was told that I would have to pay for the casino room. When I complained, they told me that I would have to wait until the 2pm check in. I finally got my room at 2pm, and I was told that I would have to wait until 3pm to be able to use the room."

It's not just because of the location, but also because of the atmosphere and the people. The Golden Nugget is located right on the strip, but it's not as crowded as some of the other casinos. This makes it a great place to relax and enjoy a few games of blackjack or roulette. The casino also has a great selection of slots, so you're sure to find something that you enjoy. In addition to the casino, the Golden Nugget also has a number of other amenities, including a spa, a pool, and a number of restaurants. The spa is a great place to relax after a long day of gambling, and the pool is a great place to cool off on a hot day. The restaurants at the Golden Nugget are some of the best in Vegas, and they offer a variety of cuisines to choose from. The people at the Golden Nugget are also some of the friendliest in Vegas.

We have tried many times before not ordering additional dishes as well trying out other restaurants near where ever though each time giving excuses like ""Oh no one else ordered enough!"" etc., But today my friend decided she would eat her meal while standing right next him behind me - which completely angered men seated nearby sitting down after seeing how much space occupied here meant nothing less than 13rd portion per person another pair occupying 2 chairs outside under electric lightbulb staring into heaven... My girl said ""I don't care"" - In fact told those guys exactly why people were angry too- She did say however only once during peak lunch hour rush period.. And yet everytime someone orders soup nobody seems willing patient waitress comes back again except saying 'sorry sir waiting'. This brings everything very close together making everyone feel nervous about others looking cross eyed somewhere inside dark room watching everybody try hard keep calm...

I was thinking about suing the owner of the restaurant for making us sick. What would I have to lose? The thing is, my girlfriend and I would have been on our way to the hospital, and it was too late. My girlfriend has Celiac Disease, and was feeling the effects of the gluten poisoning in the back of her throat. It would have been much better if the manager of the restaurant had acted with more responsibility. When we were being served, he didn't even ask us if we had celiac disease, or how we were feeling. I have never felt so insulted in my life. I think the owner of the restaurant needs to be fired. It is very unfortunate that he allowed his employees to operate in such an irresponsible manner. I've been in the restaurant industry for 12 years, and I've never experienced such a situation. It's sad to see such a beautiful city and such a beautiful restaurant turn into such a horror. I'm so disappointed in the management and the employees. It was so bad that I've had to cancel my dinner plans with my girlfriend, and I'm not even going to eat at my own house tonight.

The hostess was coughing incessantly and had to leave her duties to vomit in the back, leaving the waitress to cover her. It was horrible. We were never served our drinks, and the waitress never brought us our salads, despite them being finished. We weren't even served our entrees. The restaurant seemed to be falling apart. The ceiling was literally caving in, and a brick had fallen into the main dining room. The booths were ripped apart, and the restaurant had no business being open. It was a travesty. We were disgusted and traumatized by the experience. The only positive was that the staff was nice and apologetic. They seemed overwhelmed. It was not only a waste of money, but it was a hazard to our health. The food was bland and overcooked. We got our own bread from the basket after waiting forever for it. We ordered the swordfish and the salmon. The swordfish was tough and overcooked, and the salmon was dry and tasteless. They were both completely unimpressive. The best thing we ate was the rolls that came with the salad. The fish itself seemed fresh, but it was prepared in an unprofessional and unskilled manner. I will never eat there again. It is a health hazard. I don't know what to say, I thought you were going to say you had a great time, I would love to go to this restaurant.

I do think they're making an effort to make their prices more competitive though by offering discounts on certain days: e.g., ""One for one"" off your meal price when ordering from 5pm-10pm every Wednesday Also, try out their Asian menu which has some standouts like fried shrimp with sweet potato vermicelli noodlesgarlic pancake souppork ball with rice balls among others"

PaLM,yelp-416,"I thought that Viva Elvis was the worst Cirque show I'd ever see until I saw this confusing, convoluted mishmash of boring drivel.  Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque, but there was nothing remotely memorable about this show.  In fact, the only thing I remember about it was how boring it was.  I've seen better Cirque shows at the local mall.  The only reason I gave this one a 2 instead of a 1 is because the acrobats were actually pretty good."
Tsinghua,yelp-416,"I thought that Viva Elvis was the worst Cirque show I'd ever see until I saw this confusing, convoluted mishmash of boring drivel. Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque du Soleil but this is terrible. There is not a single entertaining moment in this entire show. It's also terribly racist. I have never seen a Cirque show that features black people in such a degrading and humiliating way. Worse still, I have never seen a Cirque show that is so boring. Even the white guys are boring. They are so poor at juggling that they barely even seem to try. The biggest disappointment is the black woman who is so bad at her handstands that she falls over at least twice every single time. How is it possible that someone who is not only NOT a dancer, but is not even that good at handstands, is chosen to be a star in a Cirque show? I think the real reason that I liked the show so much was because I am in my late 30's and my parents were immigrants. It was interesting to see how my parents grew up in a society that was not very kind to them. I found the show a great way to connect with my parents and the black woman was the only one who could connect with my mother. That is why I liked the show so much. I'm glad that I did. I hope that they will do a better show next time. Wow. It is so disappointing. Surely, there are more deserving Cirque shows than this. They should start thinking about making this one go away. The show was so terrible. Not only did the Cirque performers do not know what they were doing, but the audience was not entertained at all. The show was so bad that it was difficult to keep your attention. I could not stop laughing. They should not have gone through with this terrible production. If they did, it should be the end of the show."
LLAMA,yelp-416,"I thought that Viva Elvis was the worst Cirque show I'd ever see until I saw this confusing, convoluted mishmash of boring drivel. Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque, but I'm ready to hand it over to a different company, perhaps one that isn't so pretentious and money grubbing. I've seen so many Cirque shows that I am a Cirque-aholic. This was the worst Cirque show I've ever seen. It was just too long. I enjoyed the first half, but there was too much going on in the second half. The house clown was very good, though. Amazing show! I was totally blown away. Amazing show. The house clown was funny. We thoroughly enjoyed the show. I absolutely loved the show. It was fantastic. It was very boring, not entertaining at all, waste of time and money. Absolutely loved this show! I was lucky enough to see it on opening night and it was truly an incredible experience. The performers are amazing, the music is great, and the set is stunning. I loved how they incorporated Elvis's songs into the show as well. I recommend this show to anyone, even if you're not an Elvis fan."

Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque I'm sorry to hear that you didn't enjoy the show. Everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to entertainment. It's important to remember that Cirque du Soleil is known for pushing boundaries and experimenting with new concepts, so not all of their shows will appeal to everyone. Perhaps trying a different Cirque du Soleil show in the future may be more enjoyable for you."

Human,yelp-416,"I thought that Viva Elvis was the worst Cirque show I'd ever see until I saw this confusing, convoluted mishmash of boring drivel. Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque du Soleil. I've been watching them perform beautifully for over a decade. What was this? I still don't know what hit me, but I do know that I regret purchasing 4 tickets to this abomination posing as entertainment. Case and point, my guest of honor fell asleep next to me and I didn't have the heart to wake him up. I get that the staging and the feats are difficult and impressive, but they were monotonous and boring to watch. It's amazing how we all see different things though - I respect that other people loved the show. But in my opinion, there are 100 better things to see in Vegas."
BigScience,yelp-416,"I thought that Viva Elvis was the worst Cirque show I'd ever see until I saw this confusing, convoluted mishmash of boring drivel. Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque du Soleil shows but after seeing this one I am no longer a fan. This is Cirque de Soleil's version of Samson Delilah with some super glue characters in it (brilliant!), also includes an anime sequence where they give you hair extensions to wear on your head because ""we don't have enough."" All the girls look pretty good though...except for those weird eyes which are always going from one side to another trying to get into perfect alignment! The track list here is different than the usual Cirque du Soleil music so be prepared for something odd at times There were two things I didn't like about this show: 1) The animation was terrible; 2) And there wasn't really much action besides dancing around. (And even then I did not care.) From my experience attending Terrace Gardens in Toronto, some productions often do a better job with non-animated sequences or scenes compared to other Cirque du Soleil performances I've seen while others lack such depth. But by far the most disappointing aspect of this production was just how bad the opening performance was with their act featuring clowns who all looked alike and wore wigs, leotards etc. It seemed as if every time these same people came out in front of me, I would take off my glasses and try to figure out what sort of freak (?) it actually had been. There's currently a great deal of buzz surrounding Stage Fright - Some say it's terrific, others feel it's over-the-top nonsense yet others say it's extremely funny. For myself, I can't decide whether it's worth anything beyond its own name alone. What I will say is that when I first heard about the idea behind Stage Fright, I assumed it would be similar to several other Cirque du Soleil too-ish performances we've already seen. Then I read many reviews online stating that Stage Fright used traditional circus techniques combined with modern technology and art forms to create this unique stage effect. Basically they're having three performers dressed as witches appear behind white curtains and vanish before everyone in the audience along with ""a light emanating from nothingness."" Apparently there's only 30 seconds between each scene change during which time any spectators standing near the back part of the room won't be able to hear the performers in person due to all sorts of interference that seems to occur within the space itself. In addition to this practical use, the artists working on Stage Fright wanted ""to communicate information through movement without words or sign language...""which sounds kind of neat... Stage Fright has now opened up for more than 6 weeks at London's Palladium Theater and despite its new location, criticisms seem largely unchanged. Many reviewers still find that it's actually quite clever rather than hilarious although they've noted that it's hard to tell what to make of various aspects of the showespecially since there isn't really anyone else watching it... However, one thing that's fairly universally agreed upon among critics is that this particular production isn't very well made physicallyincluding poor lighting conditions, extensive camera movements and poorly decorated sets and props that aren't particularly appealing. (I'm guessing it'll become easier to judge once we can see the next few months...) So here's hoping that audiences ultimately respond favorably to Stage Fright especially considering that it's costed roughly 70 million dollars to build (that's right! A 100M circus!) I've done a fair bit of research concerning Cirque Du Soleil recently mostly thanks to the Cirquecontinental hashtag campaign initiated by Montreal native David O'Donnell DavidOND. One blog post shared early last week focused specifically on Cirque Du Soleil's history up until 2008 when they changed management under Guy Laliberte. That article below summarizes the major points regarding the company's origins and brief history thus far:"

Tsinghua,yelp-418,"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,so what is the meaning of curry fish ball?,and the other chinese dishes are no really good either..there is no customer service either,just some Chinese people are working there.. The price is too high,so what we think..maybe you can find better one somewhere else.. I ate here last week. I don't know why I liked it. I don't think it was worth the money I spent. There were so many food there that I didn't even try, and the food was not as good as the pictures. The manager was rude and wouldn't even talk to me. I think they only want money and that's it. Terrible experience. I tried to go back to eat there again and was so disappointed. This place is run by a bunch of rude, obnoxious, under-qualified, ungrateful Chinese who take money and then run. The staff is horrible, the food is awful, and the place is filthy. Go elsewhere. I just returned from a trip to Hong Kong and was excited to see this restaurant in a great location. The restaurant is small, but in a great location with a convenient parking lot. Unfortunately, the food is not what I expected. I ordered a chinese soup with pork and shrimp in it. The broth was bland and the shrimp was hard and dry. I will not be returning to this restaurant. Tried the meal deal and it was ok. I ordered a cup of sizzling beef and it was overcooked. I asked for another cup and the waitress told me I had already ordered one and that was the only cup they had left. So I gave her the money back and she gave me another cup. The food was really bad, I could taste the pork bones in it and there was no sauce. Not worth the money. There was no table service, no customer service, no cleanliness, and no menu. The best thing about the restaurant is that it is close to my hotel. I ordered a fish ball, chicken in a curry sauce, and rice. I felt the fish ball was not fresh and the curry sauce was bland. The chicken in the curry sauce was very good, but I could tell it was not cooked properly. The rice was just ok. Overall, not very good. I have been to many places in Hong Kong and I have never had such bad food. I have eaten at the Singapore restaurant and it was way better."
LLAMA,yelp-418,"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the top of the fish ball.not good.we had tried to order other food,but they just told us 15 minutes,but we wait more than 30 minutes,the food just came out,there is nothing good about that restaurant.we will not go there again. Went to this place on the 2nd day it was opened. The place was packed with people, but we were seated immediately. The place is small, but I find it clean. I did not order the curry fish ball, but I did try it. It was good, but not the best curry fish ball I have had. We ordered the chicken wings, and the fried chicken. Both were good, and the prices were reasonable. I do not expect a restaurant to have a full staff the 2nd day it opens, so I didn't mind the service. The people who work there were very nice, and they did try their best. I will give this restaurant another chance before I write a bad review. New Hong Kong style restaurant in Wanchai, good food, good price, good service. I will definitely go there again. Good food, good price, good service. Definitely will go back again. Mmmm, curry fish balls. The best curry fish balls I've ever had. The chicken wings were also very good. The waitress was a bit slow, but she was friendly and apologetic. I'm just glad they're open. Great food. I've been looking for this type of food for a while and I am glad I found it. I will definitely go back. I was so excited to see this restaurant open, and I could not wait to go try it out. I have been waiting for something like this to open in this area. My friends and I tried this place out the 2nd day it opened. We ordered the Curry Fish Balls, and they were not what I expected. I was told they were amazing, but they were not. I do not think they were cooked properly. I also ordered the Chicken Wings, and they were good. Not the best I have ever had, but good. The service was ok, because the place was packed. I would give it another try before I write a bad review. the food is very good. the prices are very reasonable. the only thing that wasn't good was the waitress. she was a little rude and not helpful at all. but the food was good enough to make up for it."
BigScience,yelp-418,"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on top of it instead of using seperate dishes for each dish!so that was not so great.. We have tried many other thai restaurants in HK and this one seems to be fine,But i must say that their delivery service sucks. We ordered dinner at 7pm (it does take 15 minutes), they delivered it by 10pm and when we checked up the app it said there are only 5 left which means we had to go back later. There were also some people waiting longer than us but the waiter managed to take our name from them first as he believed that since its already past 8:30 pm then maybe someone will come out with more plates! I am glad you enjoyed your Thai experience here at The Siamese Kitchen. Thank You for taking time to review and share your feedback with me all together. I would love to hear what are some suggestions or input regarding my business practice and operations because this information could help improve upon myself and also enhance customer's dining experiences even better. Please feel free to contact me via email: [email protected] Our three specialties: Thai Chicken Curry Rice Portabella Mushroom Soup Tomato Freshly grilled Salmon served with rice - all fast serve. It sounds nice...but why don't they let customers know that it's slow serve? This may affect those who are rushing home after work. And honestly, if you're looking forward to eating Thai food, probably there's nothing wrong with having less stress racing through your mind while doing something relaxing and enjoyable such as enjoying meals... Their prices are reasonable enough especially compared to their quality. If anything goes bad during cooking process, I'm sure they'll replace it without problems."

She has been doing this job for over 10 years so you know you're in good hands! I would highly recommend Ellie. My sister recommended her to me because i have been going with her weekly since my shoulder surgery about 5 months ago. Her other clients are always raving how fantastic their sessions were- so I'm sure mine won't be any different. We have recently started using Allure Wellness Massage Therapy as part of our wellness program. We can not say enough positive things about them - we feel that they truly care about us and treat each session like it is extremely important. The staff is professional, friendly and knowledgeable about all aspects of bodywork. Our kids love being massaged by Sophia (our therapist) too!!"

She was a little flirty, but she was so good at what she did. She told me about her family, she did some explaining about why she was at the spa and she also gave me a business card for her jewelry business. It was all so personal. She told me about her boyfriend and he was so sweet to her. She even asked me if I had kids and I told her no. She said I should have kids because kids are the best thing in the world. She was just really good at what she did. She took the time to make sure I was comfortable and relaxed. She made sure she did everything she could to help me feel better. She did her job very well. I will definitely go back to her. I would recommend her to anyone. You can even get a 20 off with the coupon. If you go to the spa, ask for Jodi. She is great. You will not be disappointed. They also offer some spa packages. They have a body scrub, they have a facial, and they have a massage. They also offer a hair cut and color. It is a really good deal.

LLAMA,yelp-420,"Yelp defines the five star rating as something that is as good as it gets, and Gordon Ramsay's BurGR absolutely fits that description. I will go out of my way to dine there next time I am in Vegas. I've been going to Vegas for over twenty years, and it's the only restaurant I've ever said that about. The place is a madhouse. We were seated with a reservation at 8:30 pm, but had to wait 30 minutes before we could order because the place was so crowded. Every other seat was filled, and the line was out the door. Fortunately the staff kept the waitlist in order, and we were seated when our name was called. We were seated by the window, and were able to people watch all evening. The interior is upscale, modern, and very tasteful. The restaurant is divided into three areas: a bar, a dining area, and a walk-up counter where you can order burgers, fries, and shakes to go. There are six TV's suspended over the bar area, but the rest of the place is TV free, which I appreciated. We also appreciated the fact that the music was at a low enough volume to carry on a conversation. The overall feel was upbeat and energetic. The menu is simple, consisting of burgers, sandwiches, fries, and shakes. We ordered the Gordon Ramsay BurGR, the Double BURGR, and a Spicy Veggie Burger. The Gordon Ramsay BurGR is topped with American cheese, bacon, tomato, frisee lettuce, and a peppered bun. The Double BURGR is topped with American cheese, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, and a peppered bun. The Spicy Veggie Burger is topped with pepper jack cheese, avocado, roasted red peppers, and a peppered bun. We ordered the regular fries as well as the onion rings. Each burger was delicious, and the fries were out of this world. We were not able to finish everything, and took the rest back to our hotel. The Gordon Ramsay BurGR was my favorite. I loved the beef patty, which was thick, juicy, and cooked perfectly. The peppered bun was the perfect choice for a burger this size, and the toppings worked beautifully with it. I ordered the double burger to see how a Gordon Ramsay burger would taste with a smaller beef patty. It was delicious, but not as good as the single burger. The double was overwhelming, and the beef patty was harder to identify as a result. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but even I enjoyed the spicy veggie burger. It was loaded with flavor and the texture was good. We were impressed by the service. The server was knowledgeable and helpful, and was a delight to talk with. The cost of our meal was 70.00, which included tax and a 12.00 tip. Gordon Ramsay's BurGR has three locations: Planet Hollywood, Caesars Palace, and Paris Las Vegas."

Human,yelp-420,"Yelp defines the five star rating as something that is as good as it gets, and Gordon Ramsay's BurGR absolutely fits that description. I will go out of my way to try and find a great burger, and I've had some awesome ones, but the ones I had here were some of the very best I've ever had anywhere. Ever. First impressions: Being in Vegas it's got that upscale feel to it. We had a short line when we got there, about a 15 min. wait, and the giant interactive menu on the wall is sweet. The bar is very cool with the ice wall behind the taps, and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candy. Service: Service was excellent! The bartenders were great and our server was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. Love the iPad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions. Draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers. Food: We ordered the Farm burger, Euro burger and the Brittania, and they were every bit as amazing as I was hoping they'd be. The burger patties themselves were out of this world. Cooked perfectly to order. Moist and tender on the inside, and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew. The blend of cuts was awesome, and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar. The natural taste of the beef really shined through, and the fact that they're grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just can't get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use. A burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own, with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein, and that was definitely the case here. The Farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious. The Brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it. My personal favorite was the Euro burger. The goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top. In each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced. The jalapeno poppers were really good, as were the onion rings. The chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty. I wish I could've brought a bottle of that stuff home with me. Is it more expensive than most other burgers? Yes. Is it overpriced? No. Could you find bigger, heavier burgers? Yes. Is it any less satisfying? No. Some people have this idea that the more a burger costs, the bigger it should be. Uh, no. The more it costs the BETTER it should be. If all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money, walk down the street to Fatburger, or find some fast food chain. But you get what you pay for, so if you want quality, if you want the absolute best burger in Vegas, and certainly one of the best anywhere, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is the place to be. I'm just gonna say it.... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay, or nothing special, etc. Those people have no idea what they're talking about."

Portion size is on the money for lunch. The sushi is pretty good if you absolutely must have sushi for lunch. I had the 13 year old with me. If it passed her approval then I know we were in a good spot. Pros are good selection from a wide range of Asian fair. Cons are ensuring you time the place right as it gets crowded for lunch, ensuring you land a good waiterwaitress and asking for a little bit of a higher health score. I prefer sushi served in restaurants that are 99-100. FYI, like E2, this restaurant is on the more expensive side for lunch. The atmosphere is hip contemporary. Know what you're expecting here for lunch. Unless you happen to be within walking distance to some of our best Charlotte sushiAsian joints (not in Uptown I promise), then go knowing it's the best place close by."

BigScience,yelp-422,"There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. Having moved from an office in London (and having dealt with that trauma myself) I can understand what you're going through. The fact of the matter though is it's not just about hair - at one point all those years ago I was also thinking ""I wish my hairdresser didn't have access to MY bank account!"" But then again we're still friends after almost 20 odd years now... Forgive me for being so unprofessional but if it weren't for this blog I'd probably live forever without changing my locks because I'm sure there are no better people on earth than some of these talented ladies!

Then I found Nicolette at MCN. She's amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and AND she's great at her job. Also, the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price, so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck (like me,) you can see Jenn or Kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra.

OpenAI,yelp-422,"There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. Having moved from one place to another, it can be challenging to find a new stylist, but there are steps you can take to make the transition smoother: 1. Ask for Recommendations: Talk to friends or family members who live in your new area and ask for recommendations. They may know of a great stylist that they can refer you to. 2. Do Online Research: Use online resources such as Yelp or Google Reviews to find local salons and read customer reviews. This can give you a sense of the salon's atmosphere and the quality of service they provide. 3. Visit Salons: Make appointments at different salons to get a feel for the stylist's skills and personality. This will help you find someone you feel comfortable with. 4. Be Open: Be open to trying out a new look or style. Your new stylist may have different suggestions for your hair that you might fall in love with. 5. Communicate: Communication is key. Let your new stylist know about your hair history, any allergies, and what you are looking for in a new style. This ensures that they will be able to give you the best advice and results. Remember that finding a new stylist will take time, but with patience and persistence, you'll find the right stylist for you."
LLAMA,yelp-422,"There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. Having moved from one city to another, I have had the pleasure of seeing many different stylists. I have had some good and bad experiences with stylists. I have never had any horrible experiences, but I have had some experiences that made me go ""hmmmm."" What I have learned is that every stylist has their own preferences and way of doing things. You have to find the right stylist for you. The stylist has to be willing to listen to what you want, but also let you know when you are off your rocker. LOL! There is nothing more frustrating than going to a stylist and telling them what you want and them doing something completely different. You are paying good money to have your hair done a certain way, so you should not be disappointed when you leave. I have had great experiences with stylists, but I have also had some that were not so great. Because I have experienced both good and bad experiences, I will give you my list of things to look for in a stylist. 1. How do they interact with their other clients? When you are sitting in the chair and waiting your turn, pay attention to how your stylist interacts with their other clients. The stylist should be happy to see the client and show that they are happy to see the client. There should also be good conversation between the stylist and the client. The stylist should also make the client feel comfortable and relaxed. 2. How do they interact with you? Does the stylist ask you how you want your hair? Do they ask you questions about your hair? If you are a first time client, does the stylist take a look at your hair to see what it will require to achieve the style you want? Does the stylist tell you what you should be doing to keep your hair healthy? If you have an appointment, does the stylist ask you when you want to come back in? 3. Does the stylist have a following? Sometimes, you can tell that a stylist is a good one if they have a lot of clients. A stylist with a following probably has a good reputation. If the stylist has a following, you can also tell that the stylist is a good one because their clients keep coming back. 4. Is the stylist always on time? Some stylists are always on time. They may even be early. Sometimes, you can tell a good stylist from a bad one because of their punctuality. This is not always the case, but if your stylist is always on time, then they are probably a good stylist. I hope these tips help you find a stylist that you are happy with."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-422,"There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. Having moved from the UK into Canada in 2012 I was lucky enough that my new hairdresser at SmartStyle salon had also left her previous employer just before she did so we could grow as hair-obsessed colleagues together! It's true too of many other things such an addiction can get quite strong but it never affects their ability or desire for worklife balance because they want those hours spent working on themselves not others (by this i mean literally)"
Tsinghua,yelp-422,"There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. Having moved from salon to salon since my hair was first styled, I've tried my hand at a variety of hair treatments and procedures, from permanents and color to scalp massage and waxing. For the most part, they've all been fun and relaxing experiences. I think I'm most intrigued by the prospect of having my hair lasered to grow, or the idea of being scalp massaged while the uber cool girl on the other end of the line tells me what shampoos and conditioners I should buy. I've never had my hair cut by a robot, but I've been told that it's possible, and that I should definitely try it out. I'm not sure how I feel about that, though. If I do end up cutting my own hair, I'm not sure I want it done by a robot. It's the ultimate in ""messy."" I'm all about the cute hair cuts and colors, but I also want my hair to be a little less... me. I have always loved the word, ""color,"" but it's become a lot less fun to me in recent years. I'm not a big fan of the color I have on my head, and I think I'm finally ready to move on from it. I've thought about getting my hair colored for years, but I've never been brave enough to do it. For some reason, I always think that the person coloring my hair is going to do it wrong. I've never been able to get over the idea that the person coloring my hair will do it wrong, and that they're going to look at my hair and go, ""I don't know, this is really not me,"" or ""I'm sorry, I can't do this,"" and then I'm going to have to walk out of the salon with my hair dyed some color that is not the color I've been dying it for the last five years. And I'm just not sure I'm brave enough to take that chance. I don't know what the problem is. I've been dying my hair for the past five years, and I think it looks pretty good. But I also think it looks kind of, I don't know, old. I guess I just don't think it's the color I should be wearing. My hair is a little dark, a little on the orange side, and I think it would look a lot better with a lighter color. So I've been thinking about getting it colored, and I've even started doing some research online, but I'm not sure I want to do it yet. I'm not sure if I want to spend the money on a new color, or the money on a new cut, or if I want to do both. I think the first step is deciding on a color. I know I want it to be lighter, but I don't know what color I want. I know I've heard that reds look really good on blondes, and that blondes look really good on reds, but I'm not sure if I want to go blonde. I know I've heard that yellows look really good on blondes, and that blondes look really good on yellows, but I'm not sure if I want to go yellow. I've heard that browns look really good on blondes, and that blondes look really good on browns, but I'm not sure if I want to go brown. I've heard that pinks look really good on blondes, and that blondes look really good on pinks, but I'm not sure if I want to go pink. I've heard that purples look really good on blondes, and that blondes look really good on purples, but I'm not sure if I want to go purple. I've heard that violets look really good on blondes, and that blondes look really good on violets, but I'm not sure if I want to go violet. I've heard that pinks look really good on redheads, and that redheads look really good on pinks, but I'm not sure if I want to go pink.

Having moved from New York to San Francisco, I was faced with this dilemma and did what any sane person would do – I called around to find the closest equivalent to my old stylist. After a few consultations, I landed on a place called “The Loft.” The stylist, whom I’ll call “C,” was amazing. She was friendly, personable, and had great instincts when it came to hair. I had her do my hair a few times, and each time I was happier with the results. I was starting to feel like I had finally found a new stylist that I could trust. One day, I went to see C for a trim. I had been growing my hair out for a while, and I wanted to keep it long, but just clean up the ends. C listened to what I wanted, and then proceeded to cut off about eight inches of my hair. I was shocked. I didn’t ask for that much to be cut off! I tried to tell her that I didn’t want it that short, but she insisted that it would look better. I left the salon feeling devastated. I couldn’t believe that C had cut off so much of my hair without even asking me first. I felt like she had violated my trust. I didn’t go back to “The Loft” again, and I ended up finding a new stylist who I’m much happier with."

This particular part was part of my list because it's not exactly touristy but I think it's such an interesting spot that's worth seeing regardless if you like history or not Your host has been thinking about how she wants her home to look this year. She got inspired from one of your posts earlier today and decided to paint her kitchen cabinets white. I'm sure her pride and joy would love the new bright color scheme."
LLAMA,yelp-423,"GREAT selection of local beer, good food, trendy and semi-classy, loud live music that kills conversation and packed. If you are looking to go out with friends for a drink and a little lunch, you'll have a hard time finding a better place. Hadn't been to Blind Lady in a while. Came back and tried a few new beers. Batch 135 Coffee Beer was ok, but the best beer was the Batch 136 Citrus Pale Ale. Perfect blend of citrus with a light beer. This place is always busy and full of atmosphere. Would go back again. This is a cool place to hang out with your friends. It has a bar area with a few tables and chairs, and a separate dining area. The beers are great, and the food is very good. If you go early (like 5pm on a weeknight) it is not crowded. This place gets packed late in the evenings and on weekends. This was my first visit here but not my last! The food was great and the beer was even better. It was very noisy but the atmosphere was fun and friendly."

If you are looking to go out with friends for a drink and a live band and don't care about conversation, this is a great place. The set up is cool, the band plays behind the bar, but that makes it really hard to talk to the bartender. They have A LOT of beers on tap and I was impressed by their selection of local brews. They even had a few THAT Brewery beers which I can't recall seeing anywhere else. Another good feature is that the kitchen is open late and the food is very good, it's much better then typical bar food."

I've never complained about picture quality at this theater before, but now I'm wishing we could have gone back and watched from our old seats. Lots of family-friendly films are playing right now: Once Upon a Time, The Lion Guard (which is pretty good), and Beauty The Beast. (Yes it's not too long, so you can bring your own popcorn). You know how many times we've talked about going up to Disney's Animal Kingdom? And then kept postponing it because they were only showing movies that had no star power? Well, since they've added Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, they announced some exciting news for their parks. Based on my readingincluding tweetsI think we're all excited! The first time you've heard the phrase ""landscape music"" was probably when someone told you something like ""Listen...this is landscape music"" or ""Look what happens when an orchestra plays without notes, just sounds out here...""or maybe even less formally said with varying degrees of humor, ""I'm sorry, that's not music; there's nothing there except noise."" I don't mean sound effects, which I'd almost call ""NOT landscaping""; although both sound design and landscape use natural elements as musical instruments and rhythms.... Snakeskin foam wallpaper has been shown around the world over the past decade.. Being used extensively across Europe, Australia, Asia, America... It appears everywhere within sight and touch.. However, few people realise it's origins and history.. When snakeskin became popular it was seen as a modern trend rather than any type of decoration .... however, once its popularity exploded through social media in detail images and videos began appearing online... By 2019 Snake Skin Foam Wallpaper reached the point where it was deemed acceptable by most interior designers worldwide.... In fact, it's become more accepted and even favoured below planters, hanging over windowsills etc beside artwork,furniture, mirrors, tables lamps or decorative lines such as curtains and cushions - being made using different materials if available..."
LLAMA,yelp-424,"We went to see Croods today in one of the new digital theater rooms. WOW! I couldn't believe the huge improvement. I've never complained about picture quality at this theater, but it's so much better now. The sound is still lacking, but we can't complain too much. The Croods was a fun, family movie. One of the reasons I wanted to see it was because I liked the director's work in How to Train Your Dragon. This movie has a similar feel to the Ice Age movies, but there's a lot of comedy. The humor in the movie is mostly visual and physical comedy. There's a lot of slapstick stuff. This movie is great for kids. And, as we all know, I love animating. I loved the ""making of"" animations in the credits. (Yes, we stayed for all of the credits.) I would give the movie a B. It's a fun movie, but it's not as good as How to Train Your Dragon. I love the Croods movie! I am glad you and your family enjoyed it. It is a little bit similar to Ice Age, but I think it is better! I think I am going to go see it again this week! We saw the movie yesterday and loved it! I would give it an A because I loved the family message and the humor."

The food wasn't very good. Meh... not as great or bad as others have said. They were probably too busy serving other people to prepare well enough in advance which resulted into some dishes being undercooked on me, however nothing major. Also, they served us water instead of wines. A few things that weren't advised: 1) getting there at 8:30 when it's still dark outside; 2) waiting around 15 minutes before our table arrived because they had been fiddling with stuff behind the counter rather than doing their jobs; 3) the waiter passed out the menu while we waited, then insisted that he bring the menus back while plating dinner - this sort of thing only happens if you're dining alone! I got an amazing dessert plate from them last time. It included a tempting variety of sweets including puff pastries made on-site! This time, though, it came short of the best desserts I've ever tasted, despite having tried many different restaurants throughout Philadelphia. My main concern about ordering here today? Waiting until Wednesday night to try another one of their gourmet ""pizza"" pates. Why do you want to eat pizza in your own home? Dinner was delicious. I ordered crab cakes shrimp scampi, both DELICIOUS!!! The service has certainly improved over the years and I'm glad we're going again soon!!! Excellent seafood restaurant. Crepes did not disappoint.

I've been to too many restaurants where the food is good but the service is terrible. It's just not worth it. I'm sure there are other restaurants out there that offer similar food but with better service. I'll just have to do some more research and find one that's a better fit for me. In the meantime, I'll keep an eye on this restaurant and see if the reviews improve. If they do, I might be willing to give it a try. But for now, I'm going to pass on it. Here are some other restaurants that you might want to try:  [Restaurant A] is a casual dining restaurant that serves American cuisine. The food is good and the service is excellent.  [Restaurant B] is a fine dining restaurant that serves French cuisine. The food is amazing and the service is impeccable.  [Restaurant C] is a fast food restaurant that serves burgers and fries.

They were pretty busy, but they had a couple of staff members on duty that were very nice. They went out of their way to get me a water, and even asked me if I wanted another bottle. It was nice that they did that because they are right across the street from a liquor store. I've never had any problem with the wait staff, but I've had a problem with the bartender.

We walked into the bar area where there were 4 people sitting... no waiterwaitress even though they had 3 tables full with customers all seated.... Would not return A great spot to grab beers during the day and try some Italian appetizers before going out to dinner. It's right next door to the Giovanni's Trattoria which has excellent food as well. Unless you make reservations, don't go here unless you're hungry. It took about 30 minutes to get our order ready - we ordered lunch. Also, it's hard to tell what we're eating until you've already finished your meal because they're served separately from each other - one dish comes first then another later in the meal. For example my wife got a baked potato (the rest of us ate pasta) and when she ate half way through her dish, someone brought over single serving portions of cheese and bacon for everyone which meant we'd stop ordering more food since we couldn't finish everything without having extra dishes. They also only gave me 2 slices instead of mine being smallish, medium and large sized; yours should come pre-cut because once again you'd agree that it would take too long if you're trying new items when you're still eating something different. Overall, not sure why people keep coming back because I think they shouldn't charge 13-15 per person just for appetisers; that's extremely expensive for what it really is! Great italian food! Ordering pizza roll ups is awesome. Great portion sizes. Reasonably priced. Very unprofessional staff who seemed unfamiliar with how things worked. No menu available upon arrival, followed by an apparent lack of initiative towards promptly finally providing menus. Not helpful or courteous at all- definitely do NOT recommend them.

I went in here yesterday evening and was surprised to see a young man on the till, as it was a little busy. I asked for a meal for one and he said that he would have to go and ask the chef. I felt a little strange about this. He came back with a menu and said that the chef can only do a meal for one that costs 10.99 or they can do a meal for 14.99. I asked him if he could split it and he said he would ask the chef. The chef said no. I felt very strange about this but I ordered the meal for 14.99. I had fish and chips with a salad and it was very nice. I was eating and a couple came in and ordered a meal for one and were told that they could have the 14.99 meal.

Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange.... Then I had a seat, but Boone came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the order here sign. I got up and asked, is this where I order?. They responded, wherever..... It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend 20 on a lunch and drink- long story short. I just can't support a company with staff that are do co fused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service. I've never seen a place run with such confused employees. I mean, who can't day whether its seat yourself or not?

OpenAI,yelp-427,"This place is a 4 star hotel and lives up to it. I didn't like the fact that they charge a resort fee for internet and gym access...its not even uncommon at many hotels these days to charge a resort fee, but I understand that it can be frustrating when you feel like you're paying for amenities that you may not necessarily use. However, it's important to remember that resort fees do often cover additional costs such as pool maintenance or towel service, so they can be justified on the hotel's end. If you have concerns about the resort fee or any other aspect of your stay, I would recommend speaking to the front desk or hotel management. They may be able to provide you with more information about the fee or work with you to find a solution that works for you. Additionally, if you're unhappy with the hotel's policy, you may want to consider leaving a review or feedback online so that other travelers can be aware of the resort fee before booking."

My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our way to Lahaina. It was an excellent location and well-appointed. The pool area is large and very clean, with a children's pool and waterslides. The food at the restaurant was good, although it is a little pricey. We had a couple of dinners at the pool bar, and they were very good, too. We did not have breakfast there, as we prefer to eat in the morning. There is a spa and fitness center, but it was closed when we were there. The beach was very good. It is not a long beach, but it is wide, with plenty of room for everyone. It was very clean and the water was very nice. There is a beachfront restaurant that was good. The hotel is not close to the main part of Lahaina, but it is within walking distance of a shopping center and other restaurants. The front desk was helpful and the staff friendly. It is worth noting that there is a resort fee of 25 for a daily charge. There are a lot of things to do in Lahaina, but it is not a party town. You can walk to a couple of bars, but it is a very quiet area.

My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Grand Maui Resort Spa in April. We have been staying in Maui for a few years and have stayed at many hotels. This hotel is by far the best. It is on the beach and has an amazing view. The staff is wonderful. We ate at the restaurant one night and it was very good. I also ate at the beach front restaurant and it was very good as well. The rooms are very spacious and clean. We were upgraded to a two bedroom suite and it was very nice. The pool is large and clean and the spa is wonderful. It is a short walk to the beach. The beach is great. The restaurant in the hotel has very good food. The service is very good and the staff are very nice. We would highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely stay here again.

Human,yelp-427,"This place is a 4 star hotel and lives up to it. I didn't like the fact that they charge a resort fee for internet and gym access...its not even optional, its mandatory. If its mandatory why don't you just add it to the price of the hotel room initially and not sneak it on?? That was messed up, luckily its only 20 a night. Service was good, there wasn't a horrific line to checkin like some of the other vegas hotels. The rooms were clean and the technology in them was pretty cool. I would stay here again."

OpenAI,yelp-428,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our property. That can be frustrating. However, I'm here to help. To start, I suggest researching local landscaping companies online and reading reviews from customers. You can also ask for recommendations from neighbors, friends, or family members who have used landscaping services before. Once you have a list of potential companies, reach out to them by phone or email with your specific needs and ask for a quote. Be sure to mention any special requirements or concerns you have, such as a property with pets, children, or special landscaping features. If a company is slow to respond, don't hesitate to follow up with them. Sometimes, they may be short-staffed or overwhelmed, but persistence can pay off. Additionally, many landscaping companies offer free consultation visits to evaluate what services you may need. Take advantage of these offers to discuss your options and get a more accurate quote. Overall, finding a reliable and responsive landscaping company takes some effort, but it's worth it to ensure your property looks its best. Let me know if you need any further assistance!"
Human,yelp-428,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our lot. Adrian called us back and came out to check out our lot on the same day I called. He was prepared to work that afternoon, but we had him come back a couple days later. We have several large trees (including a queen palm) and bushes with about a year's worth of growth. Needless to say, our yard was very overgrown. Ultimately, Adrian's quote beat the other estimates by a landslide, and the final product was above and beyond what we were expecting. He was responsive and fast. We plan to call him for all of our future landscape maintenance needs."
Tsinghua,yelp-428,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our property. One of those responded but he was clearly not qualified to do the job. This is a long review and the good news is that we ended up hiring a good company and it's been a great experience. BAD NEWS: The owner of this company is a stone hearted bully. We had our yard done by this company on a two-month contract. It took them 3 months to come out to our property and to come back to our property. In the first 3 months they were supposed to come out and do the work, they didn't. They would promise to come out and do the work and never show up. We would call them and they would promise to come out and do the work, but never show up. We had a big problem with a tree in our yard that was leaning in on our neighbor's house. We called them and they said they could not help us with this tree and would have to get someone else to do it. The tree was huge and dangerous and I was very afraid of it falling on the house. It was not our fault that this tree was in the wrong place. They promised to come out and trim the tree and it never happened. I called them several times, but they never came out to the property. I finally went out and did the work myself and the owner was angry and threatened me that he would take legal action. He never did. After the third month they still had not come out to do the work. I was furious. I finally went to the police. I had a warrant for the arrest of this man for failure to comply. I called the police and the police came out to the property and they had a hard time getting him to leave the property. He said he was going to do the work, but he never showed up. The police were very angry with this man and he was charged with failure to comply and not to enter. He had to pay a fine and was put on probation. He was also given a trespass warning and he was ordered not to enter our property again. He never came back. I don't know why he was so angry. He never did the work and he had to pay a fine. The police officers who came out were very angry and they did a great job. They went through the whole process with him and did everything they could to get him to leave. They had a hard time. They were very upset with him. He was very rude to the police and he had no respect for them. He did not have the respect of the community. He is not a good person. I was so angry that he would be so rude to the police. I was so angry that he would not do the work. I have been doing this for 20 years and I have never had this happen to me before. I am glad that I was able to do the work myself. It was not the owner's fault that the tree was in the wrong place. The owner was a stone hearted bully. He should have never had a business. He has no respect for the community. He is a rude person. He does not have the respect of the community. He does not have the respect of his neighbors. I am glad that the police did their job and they did everything they could to get him to leave. He has no respect for the police. He should never have a business. He has no respect for his customers. He should never have a business. He has no respect for his employees. He should never have a business. He is a rude person. He should never have a business. He is not a good person. He is a bully. He is a terrible person. I will never do business with him again. I would never recommend him to anyone. I would not let my family do business with him. I will never let my family do business with him. I will never recommend him to anyone. I will not do business with him again. He has no respect for his customers. He has no respect for his employees. He has no respect for the police. He has no respect for the community. He is a bully. He is a terrible person. I will never do business with him again. I will never recommend him to anyone. I will not let my family do business with him. I will never let my family do business with him. I will never recommend him to anyone. I will not do business with him again. He has no respect for his customers. He has no respect for his employees. He has no respect for the police. He has no respect for the community. He is a bully. He is a terrible person. He should never have a business. He has no respect for the community. He is a rude person. He should never have a business."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-428,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our property. It's not just the usual phone call or two before you get someone onsite either - most of these guys won't come close unless they can see it themselves first...which means going through your house! And remember that some services may require additional charges if we discover work is needed above what was discussed in advance (so don't be afraid - ask!). Also keep tabs as this gets negotiated: when does he start? What time will high pressure sales calls stop so I got my quote please?! When do representatives from different crews show up during normal business hours insteadof having one guy turnup who wants 200 worth done because ""that's how much others are charging."" Enjoying good customer service should always include keeping track throughout any job whether paid hourly by yourself directlyor via an independent contractor doing many jobs around town while taking care over yours too....more"
LLAMA,yelp-428,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our yard and give a quote. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised when Dan returned our phone call promptly and scheduled a time to come out and give us a quote on maintenance of our yard. Dan was very professional and made some suggestions that we hadn't thought of, but that we really liked and decided to include in our maintenance contract. He was thorough and even went to the backyard to look at the trees and shrubs. Dan took a few pictures of the yard, emailed them to us, and then emailed a written quote, which we found very helpful. While we were hesitant about the price at first, Dan was able to work with us and we decided to go with KLC because of Dan's professionalism and knowledge. The crew has been great. We've had to make some changes as to how we want things done and they've been very accommodating. The yard looks so much better and we are really enjoying working with KLC. Kansas Landscape Company did a great job with our design and installation. They were very helpful and courteous and kept us in the loop during the entire process. The design process was smooth and efficient. There was no pressure to do something that we didn't want to do and they listened to our thoughts and ideas. I'm glad that we used KLC for our yard. I've been doing business with KLC for several years now. They've always done a good job and are quick to respond to calls and concerns. I'm very pleased with Kansas Landscape Company. Had a great experience with KLC. Dan was very helpful and efficient. The yard looks so much better than when we started and we're excited about how good it's going to look in the spring! My wife and I were very pleased with our experience with KLC. Dan was very friendly and easy to work with and he helped us get the yard we've always wanted. They were prompt, courteous, and professional. The guys did a great job and we're looking forward to doing business with them in the spring. We were very pleased with the work that was done. The crew was great and very helpful. I would highly recommend using KLC. We had an excellent experience working with Kansas Landscape. They were very helpful and made sure that we were satisfied with our yard. We were very pleased with the work that was done. The yard looks so much better! KLC has been fantastic! They were very helpful and professional and the yard looks awesome!"
BigScience,yelp-428,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our property. We were referred several times (including by the assistant manager of our homeowner's association) but none came close to offering what Apex did! They made us feel like they truly cared about not just our yard but also our peace-of-mind that everything would be taken care off. The work was done in an efficient manner and included all grass trimming, leaf removal as well as seeding which yielded beautiful new lawns that looked great! For someone who has never hired anyone before, I know it can seem daunting or intimidating to go through this process on your own...but don't do yourself any favors here!! As soon as you book one call from Apex Landscape Care you're going to realize why so many people have been recommending them over their competitors.....their customer service is outstanding!! If you are thinking about hiring landscapers, I'd recommend taking advantage of my referral link when booking your appointment, it's worth every penny!! Thanks again Chris Judy from Athens GA This became the best decision we've ever made!!!! Last week after having brought grandkids up there for Christmas, the kids decided to play rough and started throwing rocks around leaving small dentsjunk everywhere....we spent 4 hours cleaning up and also had no idea how heavy snowfall could get during this time last year!!! Now if you ask me there's nothing better then being able to sit back relax knowing these guys will take good care of our yard!!! A friend recommended us to use Chris and his team to help maintain our large courtyard area that required constant mowingweed control. Once hired, we immediately noticed the difference in quality service and attention to detail - Chris visited frequently to schedule appointments based on location and to make sure all areas were being attended to properly. He maintained top-notch communication throughout the entire project and provided detailed photosvideos showing where each task was completed. Our neighbors commented upon the excellent job he performed."

Tsinghua,yelp-429,"As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, up to 20 more than comparable new carts. They refuse to take trade-ins on used carts. They are extremely stingy with their used cart selections. They will only take in 3 or 4 carts at a time and they only take one or two carts out at a time. This can take up to a week or more to process. They are extremely difficult to get a hold of. I called them several times over the course of 4 days and never got a return call. They are not willing to go to a meeting with you. I met with the sales manager and his wife on several occasions and they never returned my calls. They also charged me 250.00 to install a GPS unit and when I told them I did not want it, they refused to refund the 250.00. I would not recommend this dealer to anyone. When I got home from the trip, I immediately realized that I had a problem with the water heater. I went back to the dealer the next day and they refused to fix it. The technician I spoke to told me that he had to go to their shop in Winston Salem and then get a special part from out of state. He also told me that the price for the part was over 100.00. I tried to explain to him that I did not want to wait for the part to come in, but he refused to budge. I finally decided that it would be best to call a repairman to come to my house and fix the problem. I called a local repairman who agreed to come to my house to fix the problem. He told me that the water heater was a POS and that he would not fix it for less than 200.00. When I told the dealer that I had decided to have a repairman come out to fix the problem, they offered to refund me the 250.00 that I had paid them for the GPS unit. I told them that I did not want the refund. I finally convinced them to have a repairman come to my house to fix the problem. I would not recommend this dealer to anyone. They will charge you for a service that they are not willing to perform. I would recommend that you buy a new water heater from a local manufacturer. The Club Car dealer that I bought my new water heater from offered to have a local repairman come to my house and fix it for me for a very reasonable price."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-429,"As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, and they charge too much for accessories like tires (36 each). I was told that if we wanted to change our tire size or wheel style it would be 20 extra per set of four wheels (a total rip-off), but then when my wife went into work there she found out her old club car had half rotors on them; so now what? The salesman felt bad because he sold us one thing wrong at first sight - instead choosing an open top model with slide rails you get two closed tops without slides once your order arrives from Minnesota although his manager feels differently than him as do many other employees here including walkin customers who don't know better unless someone points something right up front regardless which left everyone confused by how different these are...and whatever happened next after Matt got off hold?""Caroline"" sounds equally affected while being generally nice enough.""Meganthe whole crew' mentioned having dealt successfully before using ""mike,"" another guy named Mike (?) makes all kinds calls sometimes even proactively since 'they have contacts everywherewho else has gotten ripped??i could go through every single dealership i've ever driven past just trying not ending...well..."""

BigScience,yelp-429,"As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, and they are not very good at helping you find parts for your old cart. I thought there might be some down time between rentals so that I could get it cleaned out, but no such luck. The owner was great! He gave me lots of helpful advice on how to maintain my cart properly. Highly recommend! I had an excellent experience with one of the owners meeting up after being in need of gasoline during Thanksgiving weekend when all other dispensaries have gone away. The store manager showed up within 15 minutes while he waited patiently outside in his truck as this issue arose. The price (10) seemed reasonable considering supplies were low due to people buying more than usual throughout the week prior to Thanksgiving causing them to run out earlier because they didn't stock enough supply. If you're looking for a fair deal, try Friendly's Auto Service Parts if it's open. Otherwise, look elsewhere unless they're saving money by cutting corners or doing repairs without insurance. (Like most places.)"
PaLM,yelp-429,"As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, and the service department is very unhelpful. I recently bought a new cart from them, and I have been very disappointed. The price was much higher than what I could have gotten from another dealer, and the service department has been very slow and unhelpful. When I first bought the cart, it had a few problems. The brakes were squeaking, and the tires were not properly aligned. I took the cart back to the dealership, and they told me that they would fix it. However, they did not fix the problem, and they told me that I would have to pay for the repairs myself. I was very frustrated, so I took the cart to another dealership. The other dealership fixed the problems, and they did not charge me anything. I am very happy with the other dealership, and I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. In addition to the problems with the new cart, the service department has also been very unhelpful. I have called them several times to ask about repairs, and they have always been very rude and unhelpful. They have never been able to help me with my problems, and they have always made me feel like I am an inconvenience. I am very disappointed with this dealership, and I would not recommend them to anyone. If you are looking for a new cart, I would recommend going to another dealership."
Human,yelp-429,"As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, then heavily discount them (kinda like cheap used car dealers of old.) But the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management. They did not listen and therefore prescribed the wrong fix at inflated pricing. When I asked questions in an attempt to get them to better understand the issue, I was told, maybe you should just fix it yourself. In addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized. The experience led me to leave their facility, do some research, and actually fix it myself. Their quote was 2000, my cost ended up at 750. The combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must come from their near monopoly in Phoenix for Club Car. I would push my car off a cliff and buy an EZGO before I would ever do business with them."

The atmosphere is great with interesting people hanging out on the street drinking drinks. Indooroutdoor tables available! My husband and I visited this cafe during COVID-virus lockdowns when it was closed due to safety measures and found ourselves seated outside overlooking the swanky shops down below us. When asked if there would be any update regarding reopening, the owner told us that he'd been awaiting an invitation from Alameda County Health Department officials so far since March 2020 to allow them back inside. Getting into our dress shoes after months of wearing sandals or flip flops made me happily dance around like a child again as did his telling us how much business he had too while sitting outside on Friday nights at 11:30 pm as each other's only customers who wanted something light to eat! This cozy cafe sits right next door to the old-school strip mall which houses three bowling alleys and two movie screens along with numerous stores selling clothes and local arts and crafts items. It may seem quaint now, but back then it was just a small coffee shop being run by a young man named Ruben Ortiz. As you enter into the restaurant area surrounded by folding chairs lined up against one side wall, orders are placed over the counter using magnetic plates similar to those used at fast food restaurants where your meal comes off a conveyor belt towards workers standing behind the table waiting to serve you. Like many places near my house though, this modest dining establishment does not have its own kitchen; instead everything including the breads, bagels and smears come directly from H-E-B supermarkets located across the street. No worries here though because every dish is prepared fresh daily using organic ingredients sourced locally wherever possible, such as mushrooms collected from a neighbor's yard. The menu features much more than simple sandwiches, salads and soups served alongside homemade pizza rolls or breakfast sandwiches filled with eggs scrambled over a bed of spinach, chive jam, smoked salmon slices and seaweed sprinkles also known as nori. My favorite lunchtime treat includes the baked brie cheese sandwich that gets grilled until golden brown followed by creamy garlic spread drizzled between sliced ham and rye croutons. For dessert try the chocolate mousse cake, banana split pie waffle cone or crepe named ""Crepette."" Although their specialties include the popular cinnamon roll sandwich and fried chicken platter, don't let appearances fool you: both dishes deserve high praise too. Mark yourself lucky at the end of good times: They do offer take-out meals starting at 10:00 am weekdays through 9:30 PM Saturdays and Sundays.

OpenAI,yelp-430,Perfect place. Designed to a T. Edgy and classy. Service is excellent. Drinks are tasty. Food is creative and delish. Coffee is the best- but beware is espresso. Patio seating is available and the ambiance is just perfect for a casual or intimate gathering. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a high-end culinary experience.

Patio seating with a fireplace is amazing for a rainy day. This place is the best kept secret in town. You will love it. I love this place! Best coffee in town. Super cool atmosphere. Great food. Great place to meet with friends. Amazing drinks and great food. It's a nice chill place to go on a weekend. It's a good place to go to when you want to get out of the house for a little bit. Awesome coffee spot, great place to study, work, and drink coffee. Good music, good people, good times. They have a great vibe going on here. I love that it's still a little small town, but they're definitely doing things right. What a great place to get a cup of joe! The staff is amazing, the atmosphere is inviting, the coffee is delicious. I highly recommend this coffee shop."

Patio seating outside gives you a view of the strip and a birds eye view of the used to be Piratte show. The short ribs, Trout, and sashimi taster are great dishes.

OpenAI,yelp-431,"We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes. I thought it was going to be some elaborate way of creating a ice cream and cupcake hybrid, but it turns out that they were simply cupcakes with a scoop of ice cream on top. They were good though, if you're in the mood for something sweet and simple. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
BigScience,yelp-431,"We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes. I thought it was going to be some elaborate way of creating a ice cream cake, but it actually came in the form of mini cupcakes. The frosting is not as rich or dense as you would expect on an icecream cake - more like if you're having vanilla bean ice cream with whipped topping rather than whole vanilla ice cream, so it's completely okay. The chocolate chips are also small (weird), which definitely helps create texture without being too obvious. These little desserts come with fruity strawberries and blueberry compote and we loved them! We couldn't decide what flavour we liked best! Gosh this looks amazing!! I've been craving sweets lately so I'm sure I'll make these when my blood sugar levels start rising again I'm always looking at things that can add crunchtexture into sweet treats and cookie dough has become one of my favorites now...these look AWESOME! Love cookies baked together, especially with different flavours within each layer! These look delicious!! This sounds absolutely perfect for those who want something light yet satisfying; thanks for sharing your recipe! You know there's nothing wrong with eating healthy foods! Bacon is added to all kinds of dishes around here- from pizza to salad, starchy side dish to meatloaf. It's just part of our culture tradition:) Thanks for the great recipes!!! Really appreciate your hard work and take time out of your day to share... If only bacon had tasted good before WW2 then everyone would have gone back to their old ways lol ..... its a shame really!!! I like using fresh chives because i find that most frozen ones have no flavor once thawed. And I don't mind cooking them until wilted;) Tried this today...yum! Not bad even though there are 2 people enjoying them right now. Thanks for posting. After watching Nailed It, we've started experimenting with whatever ingredients we might get to hand while making dinner (and trying new recipes). After several successful trials, we decided to tackle biscuits instead of stir-frying chicken breast. They turned out almost exactly how we'd imagined - crispy on outside and soft inside. This humble biscuit taste divine with rich broccoli rabe cooked al-dente and tossed in herbs. If Chicken Biscuits seem familiar, that's because they're similar to tortillas made from flour, eggs and water. But unlike buns, these aren't rolled up and placed under heat to cook. Instead, you simply mix everything together in a bowl, press it flat between two sheets of parchment paper and bake them at 350 (for 8-10 minutes) until crisp. It's quite simple enough for a first timer to do successfully too!"
Tsinghua,yelp-431,We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes. I thought it was going to be some elaborate way of creating a ice cream sandwich but I was so wrong. They had these giant muffin pans with a different ice cream flavor on each side. The bottom was vanilla and the top was chocolate. We had one bite of each side and then we split the entire thing. They were so good.
LLAMA,yelp-431,"We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes.

I never go to DQ because I am not a fan of their ice cream but the ice cream cupcake is cute. I prefer DQ to Baskin Robbins. Wow, that cupcake looks too small for the cup. It's an interesting concept. The one place that I do like to get ice cream is Dairy Queen. I can't eat a lot of it but I do like theirs. Huh. I'm still not sure I get it. I love DQ ice cream cakes! I love ice cream and I love cupcakes, but I'm not sure if I'd like to eat them together. icapillas - I've seen this concept in a couple places now. Not sure I get it, either. ZSAMD - I'm not a fan of their ice cream, actually. I prefer Baskin Robbins."

Eleuther-AI,yelp-431,"We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes. I thought it was going to be some elaborate way of creating a ice -cream inspired cake, but nope! Just the regular old boring kind that you can get at any bakery or grocery store around these parts (and probably everywhere else in this country). And unlike most bakeries nowadays who use shortening instead white sugar like we all know should've been done long ago so as not too cause diabetes levels throughout America on par with other third world countries; their version has buttery taste baked into every bite without having an ounce less fat then what Americans are used down when making chocolate chip cookies from scratch - which is actually very good because those little nuggets have more flavor than anything out there containing ""healthier"" ingredients would ever dream about producing - butter does make everything better people!!! So needless financial spending gone towards health care costs if only anyone could rationalize against using food products made mostly composed primarily 100 PURE CANOLA OIL AND WATER!!!!!! That's how much healthier my body feels since switching back over 12 years later... It doesn't matter though really whether your eating gluten free brownie mix prepared according o French Vanilla Extract rather just prepping one up yourself... Either approach will work well I've found myself enjoying mixes easier now especially during times such still living off savings while job hunting....sigh."
Human,yelp-431,"We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes.

The quality of the food, the attention to detail in service, and the overall ambiance of SW make it a truly memorable dining experience. If you haven't already, I highly recommend trying their signature dish, the Tomahawk Ribeye. It's a massive cut of meat that is perfect for sharing, and it's cooked to perfection every time. Their sides, such as the truffle mac and cheese and creamed spinach, are also outstanding. Additionally, their wine list is extensive and well-curated, so be sure to ask your server for recommendations if you're not sure what to choose. Overall, SW is a must-visit for anyone who loves a great steak and an unforgettable dining experience."

BigScience,yelp-432,"I have been to SW about half a dozen times, and it is still my favorite steakhouse in Sin City. From start to finish, every single experience I've had here has been exceptional! Recently I had the pleasure of going through their newly renovated restaurant with Chef Donnie Torres in tow for an exclusive interview. Chef Donnie was amazing!! He took time out from his busy schedule to talk about all things SW Steak House. About 9 years ago we were getting ready to open up our new location at Sawgrass Mills... We chose that name because Southwest Florida influenced us when we first started cooking together 3 months before opening. My wife's mom lived throughout southern FL so she gave me her love of food growing up as well. Our menu includes classic favorites like blackened fish tacos (recipe by her), butternut squash soup (with onions garlic); stuffed peppers, chili cheese breads etc.. The list goes on...And what would be a steak house without burgers? Aside our signature 5 ounce 100 Wagyu beef cheeks... No other burger even comes close! We are excited to share this update on our website: ""Our team will soon begin daily deliveries beginning Monday November 11th, 2020 using UberEats. If you'd prefer to place orders over the phone or via email please click here If you're looking forward having dinner with friends tomorrow night and want to enjoy some great deals then make sure to order your meals through Chef Donnie's incredible website"
Human,yelp-432,"I have been to SW about half a dozen times, and it is still my favorite steakhouse in Sin City. From start to finish, every single experience I've had here has been nothing short of impeccable. Shall we begin? NOTE: Book reservations as far ahead as you can! Putting in a request for a view of the Lake of Dreams doesn't hurt either. This place gets packed very quickly and we've never risked going without rezzys. SERVICE here has always been top of the line. I wouldn't expect anything else from within a Steve Wynn property. Water glasses are always filled and the table is frequently straightened out and picked up, be it actual platessilverware or the microscopic piece of a sugar packet. First of all: THE BREAD. OHHHHH, THE BREAD. While I will skip over their baguette type bread, I cannot rave enough about their cheddar-bacon rolls. Sheer bliss. Just take my word for it, especially if you're a fan of salt. However, there is a drawback...one time we were here, I hadn't eaten almost all day, so I quickly devoured almost three of these rolls. I was full for the rest of the dinner...whoops. THE SALADS: TIP! Make sure you split these with someone else at your table. These lettuce and vegetable concoctions are monstrously sized and are worthy of the cut in half. Caesar: Standard Caesar, but I really like the tangier-and-creamier-than-normal dressing and the Parmesan crisp. (Steve's?) Chopped Vegetable: Phenomenal. The avocado adheres the vegetables together and it is smoooooth sailing. Wedge: Ask for the dressing on the side! Also, there is a large offering of thick-cut bacon on the side, just off the cooker. AMAZING. Uhh...is there a trend with the bacon here? THE STEAKS: I have had steak here each time, naturally. And out of the six or so times, I would say five of them have been incredible. The other one, while good, just lacked that oomph that the others had. I generally get the large Filet and split it with one of my family members or we will get the NY Strip. I prefer the NY. Perfect crusting, locks in the juices and is still immaculately cooked inside to your preference. The trio of sauces you will probably have to ask for; there is a creamy Bearnaise, their house steak sauce (kind of..it's red-ish), and my favorite: Jalapeno Tropical Fruit. Just a dab on each bite really kicks up the taste notch. It's like fruity Tabasco almost. THE SIDES: Black Truffle Creamed Corn: If you don't get this, you aren't getting your full SW experience. So good...you might order a second one (if you have room!) Mac Cheese: Not as memorable as the creamed corn. Kind of boring but still good. Au Gratin Potatoes: Some of the best I've had, but too rich. I always eat the least of these because they're so rich and filling. I know we've had other sides..but I can't think of them at the moment. THE DESSERT: Funnel Cakes: I promise you...this will be the perfect cap on your evening. The 5 or so fried dough pieces come hanging on a foot-tall metal tree presentation, accompanied by a trio of sauces: Chocolate, Salted Caramel, and a Vanilla one. The vanilla one is worth licking the bowl for. Even those are 18 or so...they are not an item to be passed up (...if you have room somehow after the 27 pounds of food you may have just consumed in your 1.5 hour sitting). ...Oh, and the decor is nice too."

OpenAI,yelp-433,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us. Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to ensure that you are not ignored in the future: 1. Arrive at the opening time or a few minutes before, so that you are not there for too long before staff begins to arrive. 2. Stand in a clearly visible location that is not obstructing any pathways or entrances. 3. Make eye contact with staff members who walk by, smile and wave to get their attention. 4. If you are not acknowledged after a few minutes, politely approach a staff member and ask for assistance. 5. Be patient and courteous - staff may be busy with other tasks or dealing with other visitors. Remember, being friendly and respectful can go a long way in gaining the attention and assistance of staff members."
BigScience,yelp-433,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us. Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to get you started at Point Defiance: - Carry a map of the park with you in case its confusing or not on site. - Pack everything that is important for your day (s). - If you're going to hike it will be best if you bring water, snacks and sun protection. The hiking trail does NOT have shade so make sure you factor this into planning your itinerary. - At first we thought they would only let kids 15 years old book camping sites but that's NOT true.... anyone can do it! Next Door Adventures has a great list of reviews from previous campers as well including photos!"
Tsinghua,yelp-433,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us. Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to others: It's about 12 a mile off the main road, and you can see it on your right as you're driving along the road, about 14 mile before the 309 (aka you'll see the ruins of the old Griswold Paper Mill and a few other old houses). It's a pretty big parking lot, so you don't have to worry about a lot of people. If you have a long line of cars in front of you, you might want to take the scenic route up the hill and park on the other side of the road. When you walk in, you'll see a stone with a stele (stone marker) on it. Go to the left and climb the stairs to the second floor. You can see it in the background of the photo I posted above. The view from the second floor is fantastic. The first floor has a display of arrowheads and flint tools, and a diorama of a Native American village. It's pretty basic, but you get to see how the Native Americans used the land. We got here at 11:00 am, and the exhibit was still open when we left at 2:30 pm. There's a short tour of the grounds at 11:30 am and 2:30 pm, so you might want to get there early if you want to do the tour. The tour is very interesting, but if you're short on time, you can just see the exhibit. It's a great place to spend a couple of hours, and you can't beat the price. 2 comments: The American Indian Village at the Griswold Preserve is a great place to visit. I loved the people that were running it. We were there about 10:00 a.m., and the exhibit was still open when we left. It's really neat, and the tour is very interesting, but if you're short on time, you can just see the exhibit."
LLAMA,yelp-433,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us. Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to improving customer service: Smile, say hello, and acknowledge the customer. Would you like a large bagel and coffee for 5? They have a choice of whole wheat and everything bagels, but no cinnamon raisin. They have a decent selection of cream cheese and bagel sandwiches, but no omelette sandwiches. The coffee was acceptable, but it wasn't fresh. The bagel was tasty, but it wasn't fresh. We've been to this place a few times over the past few years, and it's never been packed, and they've always had their soda machine turned off. Good food, but not many choices."
PaLM,yelp-433,"Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to get you started:  Arrive early. The park opens at 8:00 a.m., but the gates to the visitor center don't open until 9:00 a.m. If you arrive early, you can get ahead of the crowds and have more time to explore.  Get a map. The visitor center has a large map of the park that you can use to plan your hike.  Start your hike on the Mesa Trail. This is the easiest trail in the park and it's a great way to get acclimated to the elevation.  Bring plenty of water. The desert can be hot and dry, so it's important to drink plenty of water.  Wear sturdy shoes. The trails can be rocky and uneven, so it's important to wear shoes that will protect your feet.  Take breaks. The hikes in the park can be challenging, so it's important to take breaks as needed.  Be aware of your surroundings. The park is home to a variety of wildlife, so it's important to be aware of your surroundings and to stay on the trails.  Have fun! The Grand Canyon is a beautiful place and it's a great place to explore."
Human,yelp-433,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us. Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to increase business: 1) We just wanted coffee, tea, and a sweet roll. You need to have a separate section or counter in the front that opens early and has these items for purchase. 2) If your staff passes by someone standing in the doorway and makes eye contact, they should at least greet the person with a hello. I know that it was before opening, but if your door is unlocked and people are buzzing around, it's common courtesy to acknowledge a person. We just wanted to ask if we could come back when you open and get coffee or tea to go."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-433,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us.

Bring a big crowd with you so they don't think it was just one person acting alone in demanding their refund... or go online immediately as soon when arrive at this tourist trap of crap face painting place because there is no way anyone will see that ""person"" asking for hisher dollars returned if only 2-3 other customers are asked how much more time until closing all day long! If he doesn't say anything about wanting cash refunds then maybe try another store during normal business hours? I could understand someone not returning something like 10 worth - but over 100 bucks?? Come on now... You need proof otherwise Walmart won;' t give him what ever happened out right.........Return Policy"
Tsinghua,yelp-434,"Wonderful Pumpkin Batter Pancakes, with the right amount of whip cream, cinnamon and cream cheese...yum! Orange juice full of pulp to fight the scurvy. Boyfriend had the Meat Lovers skillet...he loved it. They went down like a bullet. Boyfriend and I had the leftovers of the apple pie from yesterday. We split a large portion of Banana Bread and a 4 pack of Whoppers (that's all they had at the store). Boyfriend went to bed. Me, I ate my fill and then hit the couch with my eyes closed. I did fall asleep. In the morning, Boyfriend is back to normal, I'm still hung over, but better than yesterday. He doesn't seem to mind that I was still sleeping when he got up, which I was surprised about, but he still had a 24 hour supply of coffee in the house. I was still a bit under the weather, but we got dressed and went to the beach. I have been doing my research and the day after Thanksgiving is the best day to go to the beach. I was 6 inches taller yesterday and now I'm 6 inches taller today. I guess I'm not really sick anymore. I had an amazing day on the beach. It was cold, but I had a sweatshirt on, it wasn't that bad. The sand was cold, but I was barefoot. The waves were cold, but I was enjoying the sun. I had an awesome time and now I'm going to take a nice hot bath and then relax on the couch for a bit. We had dinner at the Olive Garden. Boyfriend had the Eggplant Parmesan. He was not a big fan of it. I had the Chicken Parmesan. I was a big fan of it. Boyfriend and I got our 20 dollar bills back from the Olive Garden. I had the most delicious cup of coffee. Boyfriend had the 20 dollar bill and 2 dollars back. We got the food for lunch and dinner, 20 dollar bill for the wine and a couple of appetizers, the bill came to 250. I spent 100 and Boyfriend spent 150. We were not charged for any tip. We both really enjoyed our meals. I am so glad that I got to spend Thanksgiving with Boyfriend. It was great! We didn't get to go out for Thanksgiving dinner because we were both sick, so I made him a nice Thanksgiving dinner. I made him 4 recipes. I'll show you a picture of my Thanksgiving Dinner tomorrow. I also made the turkey and gravy for the turkey. I made the cranberry sauce and I made the stuffing. I made a cranberry glaze for the turkey and I made the cranberry sauce. Boyfriend really liked all of it. The next day, Boyfriend and I went to the movies. We went to see Iron Man 2. Boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it. We both agreed that it was much better than the first Iron Man movie. We both really enjoyed Iron Man 2. Boyfriend had a big bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch for breakfast. He was really hungry this morning, but he wasn't that hungry. He really enjoyed his Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I had the same thing. Boyfriend had a bowl of French Toast.

BigScience,yelp-434,"Wonderful Pumpkin Batter Pancakes, with the right amount of whip cream, cinnamon and cream cheese...yum! Orange juice full of pulp to fight the scurvy. Boyfriend had the Meat Lovers skillet...he loved it. We went out for dinner on Tuesday night and drank a lot at Bistro Masque (I am still not sure I can bring myself to go back there)...and while we were waiting for our food they gave me this paper bag of cookies from their cookie jarthey are called ""Crinkle Cookies"" but don't expect them to be anything like those little crepes you get in France. They consist of chocolate chips that have been sprinkled over an almond meal base which is then baked into crumbly bits. They weren't too sweet so dad took some home as he loves almonds...yummy! Friday morning my mom emailed me about her new cookbook. She got ""Breakfast, Brunch or Dinner"" by Marcia Tilton published last month and she said it's lined up for Amazon's Top 100 Best-Selling New Books list! I'm happy because I know I'll love it. The pictures look fantastic...and they're all really easy to follow recipes. It was also Memorial Day weekend...we drove down to visit Grandpa Jay who lives in Florida. We stopped off and bought him a Mercedes Benz SL-Class sedan since he's getting married soon....but his wife didn't want one of the more expensive models so we settled on a used version of this older model. He drives around town enjoying everything they've done under warrantyit seems most parts could be replaced easily and that's what he'd prefer if something broke down. It's nice being close enough to see how things work when we're traveling through. We picked up another book ""Dive Right In"" written by Rick Stevesit's great advice for first time travelling abroad. Saturday afternoon grandma came to stay for a few days. She's been dragging her feet lately making excuses why she's not going anywhere. But after talking with everyone we've decided she's ready to make a change and try taking herself somewhere elsesomething less stressful than just driving to Lancaster annually to enjoy mimosas and gorgonzola popcorn. It would probably take quite a bit longer though because we'd need to find someone to drive us there every year since they only fly once a week... But yesterday, despite the rain, we did have a good day. After breakfast Dad found himself wishing Wayne Hancock wasn't here today because he likes to steal money away from people whenever they leave. We headed downtown where Mom spent some time shopping before heading back upstairs to eat lunch togetherthe first time in forever we've actually piled into the dining room tableMom doesn't mind sharing meals anymore; last Sunday we ate leftovers until 4:30 pm and now even coke is fine as long as there's no orange juice involved...even Sandy doesn't object these days! After lunch Dad finished reading ""A Long Way Homemystery writer James Patterson's debut novel based on George RR Martin's books featuring Cormac McCarthy as well as Robert Ludlum, John LeCarre and Gene Wolfe. His brother-in-law told me Alec Baldwin appeared in a short scene as Dick Cheney during the Bush presidencyand yes, Dad has read those novels too! Now that both brothers-in-law are gone, I'm trying to finish the ""Two Faces of San Francisco Review"" column tonight..."

Often there are new combinations That's great to hear! Sweet Tomatoes is known for offering a wide variety of fresh and healthy options in their salad bar. It's great to have a go-to restaurant that you and your family enjoy. Have you tried any of their soups or hot dishes? They offer a rotating menu that changes monthly so there is always something new to try."
Human,yelp-435,"I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's 2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. The price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too. The service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."
BigScience,yelp-435,"I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations ! I also like the juice cups from this restaurant very much. Best sushi in Bangkok! The chef here does a great job of combining traditional flavors with modern Japanese dishes. It's worth coming early to get an empty seat! After working at 7-11, we tried Oka Taco. They have soft tortillas freshly made by hand every day which makes them moist yet crispy on the outside. They make their own salsa guacamole too. It was really good but I had no time to stop after one bite because it took me about 5 minutes just to order our food. So as you can see I'm not even going to continue writing anything else... This is where all those who want some Asian fusion go. We ordered such items as Korean bbq beef bulgogi, Chinese fried rice (not that I ever eat Chinese), Vietnamese pho, Thai pad thai... Food was amazing!!!"

The bread is toasted perfectly and the pesto sauce is so flavorful. I always get a side of their sweet potato fries. They are so crispy and delicious. Sweet Tomato also has a great selection of desserts. My favorite is the chocolate chip cookie. It is so big and chewy. I always have a hard time finishing it all. Sweet Tomato is the perfect place to go for a delicious and healthy meal. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed. I always enjoy my time there."
BigScience,yelp-436,"We stayed here for two nights in July. Here's the break down: The good: 1) Super helpful staff, every person we came in contact with was fantastic. 2) Awesome in -house restaurant and bar that I highly recommend. 3) Spacious room 4) Extremely clean rooms (so nice to have a hotel where everything is spotless). Oh, my one minor complaint was about Ableton...we're used to having it play all day long while playing live DJs but at night they turn off because it's too loud from people dancingplaying outside of their room: (which felt like you were in a boarding school dormitory which is fine if you're just sleeping but not so ideal when you're trying to work on stuff! 5) Excellent location- walking distance to major restaurants and bars- formerly an airport motel, this place gets a bit noisy during rush hours after 7:30 pm (although most places close by then anyway), FYI. The quality of the hotel's service may be better than its facilities are; however, our stay was pleasant overall and comfortable enough considering the price point. We had a spacious suite, bathroom amenities included, great breakfast options available even late into the evening and a prime location near several major tourist attractions. Our room wasn't huge but felt well equipped - including fridge full size freezer, microwave oven and coffee maker. There is free wifi throughout the property along with satellite TV options available as well. If you fancy dining, there are numerous eateries within minutes walk offering a wide range of food choices such as Asian cuisine, Italian fare, Greek dishes etc., although none of them include alcoholic drinks or meals served early in the morning! Hotel was very clean and new building feel. Breakfast area has a lot of variety. Staff was friendly and kind. Location is very convenient. There are many shops nearby. Colby Mall mall is across the road which includes Starbucks coffee shop. Close to grocery store also. Nice little boutique style aparthotel located right next door to the Westin Hotel. It offers air conditioned guest rooms, continental breakfast buffet, fitness center, 24 hour front desk, business centre and pool areas. Guests can enjoy easy access to downtown via streetcarbus stops are literally a few blocks away."
LLAMA,yelp-436,"We stayed here for two nights in July. Here's the break down: The good: 1) Super helpful staff, every person we came in contact with was fantastic. 2) Awesome in park shuttle system 3) Awesome location 4) Amazing views of the mountains 5) Great pool 6) Good food in the restaurant The bad: 1) Our first night, we had a group of 50 adults and 20-30 kids arrive about 10:30 pm and stay until 2:00 am. It was like a frat party, yelling, laughing, chanting, screaming, running, etc. Not one park employee came over to ask them to quiet down, which was shocking. They were completely out of control. 2) Our second night, we had people walking through our site, and they were also quite loud, but not as bad as the night before. However, they were followed by another group of adults, who started drinking and partying as loudly as the group the night before. They had no problem talking loudly, banging into our car, and generally being extremely loud. A park employee finally came over and asked them to quiet down about 11:30, which they did, thankfully. 3) We made a reservation for two nights and upon arrival we were told that the site they assigned us could only be used for one night because of a reservation for the second night. It would have been nice to have known this at the time I made the reservation. 4) If you like to sleep in, don't go to the Tetons. It is a national park, and people are there to see the park, so they are up early. We're not early risers, but we were woken up at 6:30 both mornings by people walking through our site talking loudly. 5) We were charged 10 for each car per night, for a total of 40 for the two nights we were there. This was in addition to our campsite fee. This charge was not mentioned when we made the reservation, and it seems to me that since we paid for the site, our vehicles should be covered. 6) The sites are fairly close together. Bottom line: If you're looking for a place to sleep at night in the Tetons, then this is a good place, but if you're looking for a peaceful camping experience, this is not the place. We camped at Colter Bay Village RV Park Full Hookups (Concessionaire Operated) in a Motorhome. This is a very nice park. The only reason it does not get a 10 is because the sites are a little close together. We were in a 35' motorhome, but had plenty of room for our car and a tow vehicle. We camped at Lazy Acres Campground in a Motorhome. We stayed here overnight. It is a nice clean park. The only reason it did not get a 10 is because the sites are a little close together. We were in a 35' motorhome, but had plenty of room for our car and a tow vehicle. We camped at Evergreen Campground in a Motorhome. We stayed here two nights on our way from Colorado to Oregon. It is a great park. We were in a 35' motorhome, but had plenty of room for our car and a tow vehicle. We camped at Twin Falls 93 RV Park in a Motorhome. We were here for four nights. We had a level, grassy, pull through site. The sites are a little close together, but it was quiet and the staff were friendly and helpful. The town of Wallace is quaint and has a lot of history. We would definitely stay here again. We camped at Wheel Inn RV Park in a Motorhome. We were here overnight. It is a clean, well kept park. The only reason it does not get a 10 is because the sites are a little close together. We were in a 35' motorhome, but had plenty of room for our car and a tow vehicle.

Here's the break down: The good: 1) Super helpful staff, every person we came in contact with was fantastic. 2) Awesome in room hot tub 3) A fully appointed kitchen in our suite. The ability to eat in is actually very nice. 4) The layout of the Suite. We stayed in a one bedroom suite, we liked the separation of the living area and sleeping area. 5) Convenient distance to monorail station The bad: 1) The hike from self-parking to the the hotel, hauling luggage downstairs in 106 degree weather, no bueno. 2) the lay out of the actual hotel. Only saw two exitentrances both dead center of the hotel. It made for a lot more walking when staying in the wings. We did love our stay, we were very happy with our room and the experience in general. We planned the trip to be a no driving vacation, which it was. We parked the car when we got there and walked or took public transport everywhere we went. Had we been using the valet service, we probably wouldn't have noticed."

The bad: 1) They were closed at 4:30, so if you are going to come to WV and want to get to the CO Canal, you're out of luck. 2) You can't rent bikes there. 3) You can't rent kayaks there. 4) No outdoor pool. 5) You can't rent canoes or rowboats there. 6) No onsite restaurant. 7) You can't get shuttle service there. The Ugly: 1) The restaurant has the same menu every day, but they had some things on it we didn't see on the previous days. 2) The service was poor, and we didn't see any of the staff in the dining room the entire time we were there. 3) We weren't shown to our room until 10:30pm. 4) Our room wasn't ready until 10:30pm. 5) There was no air conditioning in the room. 6) No windows in the bathroom. 7) No safe in the room. 8) No hangers in the closet. 9) No fan in the closet. 10) No towels in the bathroom. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel. We would stay there again, and recommend it to others. Great place to stay, and it's in a great location. We didn't want to leave. I'm so glad we stayed at the Point Breeze Inn. We have stayed at many other bed and breakfasts and inns in our travels. This one is a winner. I'm glad we found it and I'm glad we had the chance to stay there. It was in a great location. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it to others who are looking for a central location and helpful staff.

LLAMA,yelp-437,"The architecture may be nice, have elevator music and all the fancy schmancy stuff but the customer service sucks and swallows. The employees are rude, they ignore the customers or just give you a fake smile. When you purchase food or something to drink, they forget to give you the change, they give you an attitude when you remind them. They are just plain nasty and rude. I'm not the only one who thinks so. I have witnessed other customers giving them grief about their attitude. A whole lot of people would rather go somewhere else but it's the only bookstore around. The young lady at the front of the store was very nice. The lady at the cafe who's supposed to be the boss is always giving attitude. There are a few employees there who are nice but that's far and few in between. If you are going to have a business you need to be nice to the people who pay your bills. Written by Freddie on August 22, 2014 e Barnes Noble - Community Relations The manager at the Union City, Ca location was very disrespectful to my 13 year old son. She told him to leave the store after he refused to take off his hat. I was so upset because I've never had an issue with my son wearing his hat inside of this store. The manager stated that it is a policy, but I have never seen a sign in the store stating this. Written by Sonia on July 23, 2014 e Barnes Noble - Job I worked at this company for 3 years in 2 different stores and I can honestly say that the company doesn't care about the employees at all. There is no chance for advancement, no chance for a raise and they don't even have good benefits. The store managers are poorly trained and when they do make a mistake the company doesn't do anything about it. They are not treated like managers, they are treated like regular employees. You would think that the store managers would be held to a higher standard but they are not. I am now the manager of another company and I will not be returning to Barnes Noble at all. Written by stella on March 12, 2014 e Barnes Noble - Helpfulness Of Store Employees The Barnes and Noble at Westchester Mall in White Plains, NY is one of the worst retail experiences I have had in quite awhile. The booksellers at this location were not at all helpful. I was looking for a book but I couldn't remember the title or the author. I asked for help but I was told that there was no way to help me find the book without knowing more information. I then asked where the staff picked books are located, but again I was told that there was no way to help me. I was even told that if I couldn't remember the title or the author that there is no way to help me. I walked out of the store without a book and in a very bad mood. I will not be shopping at this location again. Written by Abby on January 16, 2014 e Barnes Noble - Bn Rewards I went to purchase a gift card and I was informed that they don't give you your rewards back with a gift card purchase. I was told that I could only use my rewards for a book purchase. I don't understand why the company would not want to take your rewards and give you a discount on a gift card. I have used the rewards before at the register so I know that the company has the ability to give a discount. Why would they not want to do that? I have been using this store for years and I don't want to have to start going to another book store because of this. Written by Freddie on December 18, 2013 e Barnes Noble - Bn Member I don't understand how the company can still be in business with such high prices. I live in the Long Island area and there are no shortage of book stores, but I still like to support Barnes and Noble. I recently purchased an item that was over 100 and I could have purchased it cheaper at a different store. The problem is that the other stores don't have the customer service that Barnes and Noble has. I just hope that the store can bring the prices down so they can keep more customers.

We usually eat here once or twice per month, either for dinner after work (it is open until midnight on Thursdays), lunch during weekends when we have outing plans in place as well to make sure that there will be no chance our food might get cold by time they are ready! I also frequent them every other Saturday morning if you're looking something more than just breakfast from this restaurant chain; it's very popular among locals who like its brunch menu consisting mostly American style dishes although some Italian ones do creep their way into mix too... The service was excellent - not necessarily fast because these guys take pride being hospitable so don't expect any short cutshurry up attitude though:. The prices charged were competitive given what one gets value wise without having paid an outrageous amount over market price especially considering how much ""free"" parking space available outside each location which makes visiting multiple times throughout week easier:)..

I was a little disappointed with the service this time. I felt that they tried to rush us a little bit and that the waiter was a little too interested in making sure that we were finished eating and ready to go so they could get the table cleaned and ready for the next customer. I really did not like the fact that he was in a hurry to take our dessert plate and the bread basket away when it was clear that we were not done with our meal. The food was very good as always. It was very good and we will be back. I have been here a few times in the past and have always enjoyed it but this time it was a little loud.

LLAMA,yelp-439,"Dear 4TWNT, We started off rocky a week ago with a porchetta sandwich that was a little light on the por and super heavy on the.... uh.... etta? More fat, less meat, please. We've just been able to work through it because we know that we're in this together. Just don't do that again. I know you're excited for the weekend and you just want to have some fun. But, seriously, we need to talk about this. As in, you need to talk to me. Because, right now, we're just not on the same page. So, let's start off slow and easy. Remember the porchetta sandwich? Well, I don't want to get into details, but I have to tell you that that's not the kind of sandwich we can just go out and get any time. That's not the kind of sandwich that can just be ordered at a whim. That's not the kind of sandwich that can just be picked up at the grocery store. Nope. That's the kind of sandwich that takes planning. That's the kind of sandwich that takes time. That's the kind of sandwich that takes an effort. You can't just expect a porchetta sandwich to be on the menu. You can't just expect a porchetta sandwich to be hanging around on a Thursday afternoon. So, I'm sorry. I'm just really not in the mood for a porchetta sandwich today. And I know we've got a date with a grilled cheese sandwich next week, but I just think we need to take a step back and re-evaluate our relationship. What do you say? I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, 4TWNT. I have a feeling we're going to be really good friends. I wanted to like this place. I really did. The things they say on their menu about how they source their ingredients, how they make everything from scratch, how they get their produce from local farmers... it's all the right things to say. And, there are a few moments where they execute on that promise. But, there are some issues that are just too big to overlook. And, they start right from the very first moment we walked in the door. It's a tiny place, and we were the first customers in. The woman behind the counter was the only person working in the restaurant at that moment. And, she was on the phone. I'm not really sure what she was doing. The phone was on speaker, and she was just sitting there listening to the person on the other end of the phone. Maybe she was waiting for instructions. Maybe she was waiting for the other person to hang up. Maybe she was just waiting for her shift to be over. So, we stood there and waited. I'm not sure how long it was before she acknowledged us. It felt like we'd been standing there for at least a minute or two. But, I'm sure it was only about 30 seconds. She apologized, and, finally, got off the phone. And, I get it. You're working by yourself and you're on the phone. But, there's nobody else in the restaurant. So, it's really not that big of a deal to just hang up. I mean, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I feel like it's really bad form to make customers wait while you're on the phone. So, we finally got our order taken and she set to work. The food took forever. I mean, it was a really long time. And, I don't really know if it was because she was working alone or if it was just a terribly slow day in the kitchen. The porchetta sandwich was pretty good. The pork was very moist. Maybe a little too moist. It had a pretty strong pork flavor, so if you're not a fan of pork, then this is not the sandwich for you. The bread was okay. Not terribly impressive. And, the greens were a little underdressed for my taste. And, the tomatoes were a little cold. So, not bad. But not good enough to get over the fact that we were the only customers in the restaurant, and it still took an extremely long time to get our food. The grilled cheese sandwich was very good. We tried the bacon and the tomato jam. The bread was very good. It was soft"
Tsinghua,yelp-439,"Dear 4TWNT, We started off rocky a week ago with a porchetta sandwich that was a little light on the por and super heavy on the.... uh.... etta? More fat, less por? We didn't know what to do. Luckily, our sister, Cheyenne, found the perfect porchetta sandwich for us. Cheyenne's dad has a restaurant in Texas, so she has a better idea of what we need to eat than we do. She recommends this one. It's a grilled turkey, ham, and cheese sandwich with mustard and grilled onions on a toasted French bread. It's ooey, gooey, delicious. I was impressed. It even has a mustard sauce on the side. It's a little on the pricey side, but a good thing is that you can make it at home, too. This grilled turkey, ham, and cheese sandwich is made with a crusty French bread. The crust gives the sandwich a little crunch. The sandwich itself is a bit messy. It's a bit messy because the sandwich is so juicy. But it's so good, you'll forgive it. In fact, you'll probably forget that it's messy. This grilled turkey, ham, and cheese sandwich is served with a mustard sauce. You can make this sandwich at home, too. Cheyenne's dad makes his grilled turkey, ham, and cheese sandwich with a mustard sauce on the side. He said that the sandwich is better when it's eaten with the mustard sauce. So, he serves it that way. You can also serve it with ketchup, or sriracha sauce. I didn't try any of those. I just loved the sandwich. I don't care what Cheyenne's dad says. I think this sandwich is the best. It's delicious. It's juicy. It's warm. And it's just plain good. You have to try it. The next time you have a sandwich craving, try this grilled turkey, ham, and cheese sandwich. You'll thank me. But you won't tell Cheyenne. She'll be mad. What's in a name? So, we know what's in a name. But what about a blog name? How do you decide on a blog name? This blog was named after our last 4TWNT project, which was called the 'Four Things That Never Went In To Your Blog.' We didn't have a blog name for this project, so we used this blog to post our thoughts on the project. But we didn't have a blog name for the blog, so we just used the name of the project. After that, we started a blog called 4TWNT to document our family. This blog became our family blog. We started another blog called TNW Diaries to document our adventures as travelers. This blog became our travel blog. Then we started another blog called Beyond 4TWNT to document our adventures as parents. This blog became our parenting blog. So, this blog was named after our last 4TWNT project. But this blog is also named after a blog that we started for our family. And this blog is also named after a blog that we started for our travel.

Tamar loves you guys though, and she's like my Jewish mom. Mom said go back. I did. And I'm happy I did. The chicken salad sandwich is pretty spectacular. It's served on toasty sourdough along side some greens with a zippy little dressing that's a lil sweet and a lil sour. Chicken isn't overly dressed in thick mayo-y mayhem. It's super light, packs quite a punch, and you should love knowing it's local. Not typically a dessert eater pie grabbed my eye, and when I asked the gent for a rec (Scott maybe?) he said blackberry was the way to go. And so I went there. He warmed that bad boy up post sandie and then I shoveled it in my mouth the second he dropped it off. Seriously at one point I remember saying to myself (internally) take a break.... you've been going at this thing, you're in public.... breathe.... enjoy. But it was too good. Flaky crust. Tart berry inside. Coarse sugar sprinkled atop. The only thing missing was cloyingly sweet aftertaste and corn syrup which they apparently don't use to bind fruit. (Big ups for that.) And now a plea: Furniture builders of Madison.... craft a cool table to run the entire length of the wall and give these guys more seating. They're growing, and it'll be impossible soon (like tomorrow) for mass peeps to eat and enjoy. Donate a mean mesa and I bet they'll put your cards out and tell everyone they know about your rad add.

OpenAI,yelp-439,"Dear 4TWNT, We started off rocky a week ago with a porchetta sandwich that was a little light on the por and super heavy on the.... uh.... etta? More fat, less meat, right? I'm sorry to hear that your porchetta sandwich wasn't up to par. As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to prepare food, but I can offer some tips for making sure you get the perfect porchetta sandwich. When it comes to making porchetta, fat is an important and flavorful component, but it shouldn't overpower the meat. If you're making porchetta at home, make sure to choose a cut of meat that has enough marbling (fat within the muscle tissue) to stay moist and tender during cooking, but not so much that the meat gets lost in a sea of fat. If you're ordering a porchetta sandwich at a restaurant or deli, don't be afraid to ask questions about the ingredients and preparation process. You can also try reading reviews or asking for recommendations from friends to find a place that's known for great porchetta sandwiches."

The avocado salsa they make is delicious too! My favorite dish though? They offer an amazing seafood option. We ordered fish tacos which were absolutely perfect - the fish itself was extremely fresh and very flavorful. The restaurant has several locations throughout Houston including one just off Katy Freeway. You can find out more info about them here! It's been two months since I've posted any of Tasty Tuesday recipes so I'm happy to be able to share some new picks from my recent evening meal date night last week. It happened this past weekend when another beautiful day brought us outdoors to enjoy dinner together at Short Shell Seafood Grille Bar, where we enjoyed all things oysters. I've shared ideas before regarding how much time you should spend preparing your own food versus ordering takeout or eating out. While it's true that cooking takes longer than going out, preparing meals yourself can save money by not having to pay delivery fees andor tipping and also allows you see exactly what goes into making each dish you're enjoying. As part of our budget plan, we try to limit waste within our household buying less meatpoultryfish if possible yet there are times like these special occasions where we don't have many options other than ordering something prepared elsewhere. Short shell provides outdoor seating along side a small parking lot provided free of charge by the Main Street Development Corporation. From sunset until dusk, patrons may choose between tables of 4-8 seated otherwise reservations must be made over the phone during business hours Monday through Friday 8am-4pm Pacific Standard Time)."
Human,yelp-440,"Wow. I had a great lunch today at Smoke and left with a big smile on my face. I loved the pork taco with caramelized onions that seemed slow cooked and melded perfectly with the tender pulled pork. Like all the tacos, it was served with lime juice and cilantro. Also had a breakfast taco with housemade chorizo. In short, these tacos are (expletive deleted) delicious. Also tried the macaroni cheese which contains scallions and mascarpone. It was also above average but a tad too salty. My guest also enjoyed the veggie tacos and Apple jalapeno slaw which was lovely. Good service was appreciated. After reading several other reviews, I was worried about the wait but our food arrived in a perfectly feasible ten minutes. Granted, it was between meals around 3 o'clock and we were the only patrons. Once they make updates to a second restroom, they plan to expand downstairs with more tables. Highly recommended for dine in or takeout. Go for the pork tacos, stay for the rest of the very small menu."
OpenAI,yelp-440,"Wow. I had a great lunch today at Smoke and left with a big smile on my face. I loved the pork taco with caramelized onions that seemed slow cooked That sounds delicious! I'm glad you enjoyed your lunch at Smoke. Slow cooked pork is always a crowd-pleaser, and the addition of caramelized onions would have added a nice depth of flavor to the taco. Do you plan on going back to Smoke to try any of their other dishes?"
Eleuther-AI,yelp-440,"Wow. I had a great lunch today at Smoke and left with a big smile on my face. I loved the pork taco with caramelized onions that seemed slow cooked for hours, but actually couldn't have been done longer than 1:30 minutes in this beautiful restaurant atmosphere.""

Tsinghua,yelp-440,"Wow. I had a great lunch today at Smoke and left with a big smile on my face. I loved the pork taco with caramelized onions that seemed slow cooked and smoky. There were also 2 pulled pork tacos that I wasn't crazy about but the sauce was pretty good. The chorizo tacos were a little on the bland side but the salsa verde was very good. The 2 chicken tacos were really good, juicy and flavorful. There was a fresh avocado salsa on top and the jalapeno salsa was spicy and very good. I'm looking forward to their burritos and bowls and all of the desserts that I haven't tried yet. I also loved the concept of their menu. They have some vegan and gluten free options and they are open for dinner and brunch. I'm glad I got to try their lunch menu first and will definitely go back for their dinner menu and more desserts. Tuesday, April 27, 2014 This past weekend I had the chance to see the opening of ""The Lion King"" at the Regal Silver Legacy Stadium 16 in Lancaster. This was my first time seeing a Broadway show and it was so worth it. It was absolutely amazing. I was so excited to see this show since it is the 15th anniversary of the film that made it a classic. I saw the original movie when I was 5 years old and it has been on repeat since then. I love Disney movies and this was definitely a must see for me. The movie has been adapted to Broadway and the cast is amazing. The music was amazing and I love the story. I also love how they incorporated all the songs from the movie into the Broadway show. The costumes were amazing and I loved the live animal show. There were some parts of the show that were funny and cute and others that were very emotional. I also loved the way that they blended the live animal show into the show. They had the lion cubs in the beginning of the show and then they came back for a few songs. I also loved the puppets they used for Rafiki and the hippo. The production was very well done and I was blown away. I'm glad that I had the chance to see it and I can't wait to see it again. I was a little nervous to go because I don't like the spotlight but I really enjoyed it. I also liked that the show was very family friendly and not to kiddy. This was a perfect show to see with the family and the kids would love it. I'm looking forward to seeing it again and I'm excited for the 20th anniversary of the movie. Sunday, April 25, 2014 I had the chance to go to the Lancaster Arts Center for the benefit of the Lancaster Food Bank and they were having a silent auction and live auction. I was able to win a chance to win a day at the Lancaster Zoo with a 50 gift certificate for tickets. I was so excited and I can't wait to go to the zoo. I also won some handmade jewelry, a 50 gift certificate for chocolate, a chocolate bouquet, a gift basket, 3 tickets to see ""The Lion King"" at the Regal Silver Legacy Stadium 16, and a day pass to the Poconos. I had a great time and I was so lucky to win some great items. The Lancaster Food Bank has been very good to me and I'm happy that I was able to help them out with their fundraising. I'm so glad that I was able to go to the Lancaster Arts Center for the benefit of the Lancaster Food Bank. Saturday, April 24, 2014 Last week I had the chance to see ""Hamilton"" at the Aladdin Theater in Lancaster. This was my first time seeing a Broadway show and it was amazing. I'm so glad that I saw this show because it was an amazing experience. The show is based on the life of Alexander Hamilton and it was a great story. I loved the songs that were included in the show and I loved the costumes and the set. I loved the Broadway style songs and I loved the way that they incorporated some songs from the movie ""Hamilton."" The show was a little long but it was worth it. I was able to see a lot of the story and I loved it. I'm looking forward to seeing it again and I can't wait for the 20th anniversary of the movie. I was a little nervous to see this show because I don't like the spotlight but I really enjoyed it. I also liked that the show was very family friendly and not to kiddy. This was a perfect show to see with the family and the kids would love it. I'm looking forward to seeing it again and I'm excited for the 20th anniversary of the movie."

We highly recommend using this awesome guy to get all your party needs. We used Jimmy at our wedding last Friday! He made it so easy on us by coming up to make sure everything was picked out ahead of time, also helping coordinate with the other vendors we had hired as well (make-up artist etc). The night went smoothly from start to finish - he even catered to our requests when there were some special songs that needed to be played! I got married during pandemic but my husband worked abroadTaiwan; therefore I only have one family member who could come over meet me spend 2 weeks with me before the wedding day. However, My parents agreed not because they wanted there grandkid to marry, just want their own daughter to enjoy her happy occasion together with them:) So, after putting off planning for almost 1 year due to Covid-19 crisis, finally decided to do online booking since June 2020 with Sugarlife Weddings Agency. They helped manage every aspect such as: venue selection, food drinks arrangement, photography arrangement, decoration arrangement, flowers arrangements, music arrangement... All aspects are planned very professionally which suited my budgeting too.... I am really thankful to join with Sugarlove Wedding's team once again for marriage ceremonies!! It's early July now - temperatures still hover around 80 degrees Fahrenheit here in Texas. It's smart to stay away from big crowds anytime you can if you're prone to heat exhaustion or dehydration.

Human,yelp-442,"I am a las vegas local who has been to plenty of buffets all around vegas with that said I was not impressed with this buffet what so ever! After waiting in line about 45 mins we assumed the food must've been great. I would think a popular casino right off the strip would have excellent food selections, wrong. The food did not look appealing. I couldn't even bring myself to try it. The desert selections are very very limited, and sad. The only thing that made the buffet was the crab legs. Those were great but that's it!! Buffets should rely on one item alone! If it weren't for the crab legs and a decent slice of meat this buffet would have only got one star. If u want a great buffet go to the M resort. That is one of the best in vegas.!"
Tsinghua,yelp-442,"I am a las vegas local who has been to plenty of buffets all around vegas with that said I was not impressed with this buffet what so ever! After the long drive down to the city for my brother's wedding I decided to eat at the buffet. I did a little research online and it looked like a good buffet. So we got there around 11:00am and we were seated right away. When we got our menus we were disappointed that they only had 12 a size pizza. They were all the same pizza. I was very disappointed because I have eaten at many buffets in Vegas and they had pizza and I ordered it. I had a steak sandwich and a strawberry shake for 20.00. It was pretty average. It was nothing special. I did not feel like eating anything else after that. I had a coffee for 2.00 and I had the sugar and cream. That was a bit much. Overall, I am not a big fan of buffets in general, but I do not know if this buffet is good or bad. If you want a buffet I would say try it out but you will not be impressed. The service was fine. If you order a drink they will bring it to you but they do not bring it to your table. They bring it to the bar and it will cost you extra. They do have a restaurant on site so you can eat in if you wish. The food was not that great. I was disappointed."

After reading reviews online I thought I would give it a try. The price was right and I was excited to see what they had to offer. When we arrived at the buffet the line was out the door so we waited patiently for our turn. Once we were seated we were immediately disappointed. The food was cold and the selection was very limited. We only stayed for about 30 minutes before we left. I would not recommend this buffet to anyone.

After I'm sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your experience at the buffet. If you would like, I can try to provide some helpful tips for finding a buffet that meets your expectations. It could also be helpful to read reviews from other locals to get an idea of which buffets they recommend. Alternatively, you may want to try a different type of restaurant or cuisine altogether. Las Vegas has a wide variety of options to choose from."
BigScience,yelp-442,"I am a las vegas local who has been to plenty of buffets all around vegas with that said I was not impressed with this buffet what so ever! After the dinner you were given your choice on top off being offered but they scooted me over to the pizza place which is only about 12 mile from our room, and pulled out doughnuts other desserts instead. The party guests had access to 2 waters stations as well where those water could be consumed at anytime during their visit without having to pay extra for it. We also got another 5 glasses of wine each (with no tax or other fees added), 3 bottles of mojitos in addition to complimentary drinks throughout the evening. We saw a lot of people leave early thanks to some bad food...there wasn't much else available there aside from a few small appetizers like snacks..the menu on the bar didn't have everything we wanted to eat there.. Food was terrible, never seen my family upset enough: (There are better places than here too. They can serve tofu things why can't they add something different?? The food here sucks. It should encourage them to make new dishes more often because it doesn't even seem worth paying 60 bucks per person just to get one dish.... Outstanding service by friendly staff. Exquisite gourmet cuisine at an affordable price. Remembering memories for life! Scarlet Pink - Our glassware collection includes sparking reds, sparkling whites, and vibrant orange. To complement these colors, we'd suggest serving in either blue or purple vessels such as tequila flutes or sangria cups. Our Vermouth Collection includes labels ranging from classic brands to modern favorites. Each label represents a unique flavor experience: Some of your favorite spirits will find its counterpart within our lineup of whiskeys.

LLAMA,yelp-442,I am a las vegas local who has been to plenty of buffets all around vegas with that said I was not impressed with this buffet what so ever! After paying 26 dollars for this buffet you are left hungry and dissatisfied. The food was good and the variety was good but the quantity of food they gave you was poor. My advice to you is do not eat the fish because it is very small and it is pretty fishy. You will not have to wait long in line but it will not be worth the wait.
OpenAI,yelp-443,"I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times, not because their whack fake boba is that good, I understand that you do not want to leave a bad review based solely on the service. However, it is important to provide an accurate review of your experience. If you feel that the quality of the boba at Tea Infusion is not good enough for you, that can be part of your review. If you have any suggestions for improvement, you can mention that as well. It is always helpful to provide constructive feedback."
PaLM,yelp-443,"I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times, not because their whack fake boba is that good, but because it's close to work and I get a free drink with my Starbucks card. The service here has always been terrible. I've waited 20 minutes for my drink multiple times, and once I had to wait 40 minutes! The staff is also very rude. They're always talking to each other and ignoring customers. The last straw for me was when I went in to get my drink and they told me they were out of milk. I asked if they could make it with almond milk instead, and they said no. I asked if they could make it with soy milk, and they said no again. They said they were only able to make drinks with dairy milk. I told them that I was lactose intolerant and that I couldn't drink dairy milk, and they said they couldn't help me. I ended up leaving without a drink. I will never be going back to this place again. The service is terrible and the drinks are not worth the wait. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

And when you are asked to wait, they should give you a drink in your seat, but not just a glass of water."
LLAMA,yelp-443,"I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times, not because their whack fake boba is that good, but because the service is always so good. Unfortunately, this last time was a bust. I was served by a woman with black hair, glasses, and a piercing in her nose and a piercing in her eyebrow (I know this because the first time I came here she had a nose piercing and an eyebrow piercing as well. I don't know if she is just having a hard time but this time she was just rude. I understand she might've been having a bad day but seriously, I've had bad days before too and you don't see me taking it out on customers. I was already pretty annoyed with the bad service but I was still a good customer and decided to pay her with 50s because I didn't have change. After she gave me my change, I counted it and I was missing 5. I know I don't make the most money in the world but that's still a pretty big deal to me. I went up to her and asked her if she knew that she gave me the wrong change and she pretty much accused me of trying to scam her. I was really appalled. She's the one who made the mistake and now I'm the one in the wrong? I've seen this happen a few times before in other places and I've always understood that it was an honest mistake. But this woman is straight up mean and I don't think I'll ever come back here again. I don't know if she's the owner or just a cashier but I know that she's the reason I won't come back here. I was looking for a nice quick sandwich lunch today and a friend recommended the Tea Infusion cafe on 4th St. I am not really a tea drinker, but the food looked good and the place is really nice. My sandwich was huge and really tasty. The bread was fresh and the veggies were crisp and fresh. I ordered the 4. The tea was also good and not overly strong or bitter. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely be back and I'll bring friends with me."

I understand hemorrhoids, headaches, tummy bubbles, and domestic issues. I know everyone has a bad day. Well this place has a freakin' black cloud just chillin over it! Everytime I step in this joint, it's clear that the person behind the counter feels inconvenienced by having to actually make my order. Seriously, I'm ordering a chai tea with boba, not baked alaska. The worst part is I'm in a pissy mood when I leave the place. So I gave it a try and the only thing that comes to mind....... treat me like ass once, shame on you. Treat me like ass twice, shame on me. Treat me like ass three times, and I'm calling you out. Get a grip tea fusion you are not the only spot in Tempe Market Place, your tea is mediocre at best and your boba is not even legit. I sincerely hope the managers take this review into consideration. And, on one last personal note, If I get another pair of eyes rolled at me when I walk by the store I'll personly sit outside and hand out samples from paradise bakery, coffe bean and juice it up smoothies! All of which offer tea."

And since you can't really judge from pictures online (even my photoshop skills suck), I'll give you some pictures below so you're able to see what we were talking about earlier: This sweet little shop has inspired many of us with its lovely decoration. The walls are full of cute pandas and other adorable characters! The owner also makes her own snacks, including various types of boba balls! Not only did she make our favorite ""Whacky Whip"" Boba here at Teainfusion, she's even made it available via delivery if you'd prefer to try it without having to drive all the way there yourself...

BigScience,yelp-444,"Love this place! Great service and good quality work. Drive from east mesa to get my nails done here:) This is by far the BEST salon I have ever been too!!! The atmosphere, professional staff and amazing nail technicians are just some of the reasons why I love going here!! Can't wait for next time!!! I am so glad that i found this Salon because it was very nice the owner Mr. Damian gave me a lot of attention and helped me pick out what i wanted he even made sure they had everything needed for my manicure. Great experience at K12 Nail Designs. They were able to accommodate an early appointment without any problem and provided great customer care with their promptness as well. My daughter requested another mani-pedi after her first one which she loved, and now I'm happily planning on doing mine in April when it's back up again They use top notch products! Incredible service and location. Make sure you ask about their fundraiser where they will donate 1 dollar per pedicure or mani to your favorite charity if you mention them before hand. For those who need custom acrylic nails...you can't go wrong here!!! They're talented lovely people - and they're affordable! Highly recommend!!! The best job I've ever received at ANY salon- here's how: A week ago, my hands started to swell uncontrollably. After waiting two days (which would've prevented getting my nails painted) while we waited for an ER doctor's consultation, I finally called Jason and told him I'd be late taking off his casts due to excruciating pain from having fungal infections spread through all four fingertips and both elbows. He said he'd come over ASAP! On Saturday morning around 9:30am, Jason showed up wearing rubber gloves, protective goggles and latex booties. His assistant also wore these items along with disposable headphones to keep our conversation private since there was no phone reception nearby. We discussed my situation in-depth then began working together to determine the solution. Finally finishing up around 3pm, (the day following the initial call), after multiple visits to the ER, Jason performed several procedures including removing three large warts using only tweezers and band aids...healed within 5 minutes each time! Also removed infected skin and used medical alcohol pads until the area dried completely. Finally applied drops to help kill whatever germs may still remain. (My fingers quickly perked right up!) Without question, he did fabulous work and has restored much-needed health to my hands. He explained exactly what's going on, recommended medications and follow-up appointments; I'll definitely be returning soon to see how things progress. Thanks again Jason!! In order to ensure highest level of hygiene, everyone entering the premises must wear masksmasksn95 respirators according to state regulations. Beginning Monday March 16th we've implemented new policies regarding vehicles into the building. No passengers allowed unless accompanied by front desk personnel, new policy effective immediately."

LLAMA,yelp-445,"I may be lactose intolerant but that has not stopped me from binging on gelato. Gelato 64 is located in the Lee Lee's Plaza on the NE corner of Dobson and Main Street. It is a small gelato shop with a seating area. Their gelato is actually quite good. I personally like the peanut butter and chocolate flavor. I've been to gelato 64 numerous times and only once have they run out of the flavors I wanted. So, that's pretty good. The flavor selection is always the same. The seating area can be kind of a bummer. There are 6 or 7 tables and a few chairs. The tables are always sticky and gross. The chairs are uncomfortable. The view out the window is not pleasant. And there are usually a few teenagers hanging around outside. But, if you can get over that, then the gelato is worth the trouble. Gelato 64 is located at 804 E Main St 102, Mesa, AZ 85203."

Gelato 64 is located in the Lee Lee's Plaza on the NE corner of Dobson and Hillcrest, just a few doors down to The Daily Scoop (which I also love). They have about 12 different flavors including two vegan options: coconut milk yogurt strawberry sorbet which are both quite good! Oh yeah...and they're open til midnight Tues-Sun so you can get your ice cream fix any time....but don't let yourself go too far because it will ruin everything for tomorrow!!"
Human,yelp-445,"I may be lactose intolerant but that has not stopped me from binging on gelato. Gelato 64 is located in the Lee Lee's Plaza on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner. I'll tell you now...it's no Arlecchino, but the quality of the gelato is better than the one just down the road from this place. The shop is brand-spanking new, almost clinical-looking, with it's white walls, streamlined lighting, and minimal furnishings (mostly Ikea-looking).The interior is simply non-descript, almost too bland and boring-looking. But perhaps there was a reasoning behind the seemingly sterilized, minimalist environment...ah, yes, of course. The element that seems to give the room character and subtle vibrancy is the gelato. The flavor selection is pretty impressive...almost Baskin Robbins-esque, with its 31 flavors (or maybe more!). The consistency of the gelato is excellent, very creamy and it doesn't leave you with a gritty feeling in your mouth. As far as flavors go, I think the fruitier ones win over the chocolate, or cream-based flavors. For example, their rum raisin just lacked the punch of rum, and their cherry vanilla really was just vanilla with chunks of frozen cherry. If you were only served one chunk of cherry, then expect to be eating vanilla gelato the rest of the time. In contrast, their mango and raspberry, for example, had just the right tartness that made you pucker with delight. The fruity flavors were true to taste and were magnificent when combined. I say, go for the fruit flavors! The staff members were very friendly and courteous, and were very generous in giving you sample tastings. You gotta appreciate that!"

Using a spatula, spoon or cutting board spread half of your dough onto lightly floured countertop with fingers to evenly distribute. Use small cookie cutter shapes (or other shape) if you like. For making round cookies I used my glass measuring cup which makes it easier for even spreading out each cookie when they are baked. Cover the top with another piece of parchment paper, put one more square of parchment on top and roll into balls 1 12 inches in diameter. (If rolling them do so very gently as this will help prevent cracks.) In microwave-safe bowl combine 13 cups sugarkaromaple syrup milk together until slightly warm - about 15 seconds. Divide mixture between all 6 prepared pans leaving 14-inch edge uncovered at bottom. Place mitten over handsdough scrapers, pour remaining 23 cups of icingcoffeesugar mixture into bowl and toss large handfuls of chocolate chips into top and let sit while pan is preheating (5 minutes). Bake in single layers for 17-18 minutes; cool completely before lifting up sides of desserts using metal spatulas. (The chocolates melt without burning well enough yet.) A great trick is to place dessert between two sheets of wax paper then cover sweet treats tightly with foil bag once cooled..This helps keep them moist after removing from oven."

Tips for prospective students Make sure you do your research. Don't rush into making a decision. I learned this the hard way. I chose to attend the university because I thought it would be a good fit for me. It wasn't. The campus was beautiful, but the people there were not as welcoming as I thought they would be.

The campus is small, but they do have a campus police department. I have never had any issues with them, but they are there if you need them. Greek Life I am not a part of Greek life, but it is big here. They have a chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, and many of the guys are part of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. Clubs and Activities There are so many clubs and activities at Hampton University, that it is hard to keep up with them all. I am involved in several organizations, but I can never keep up with them all.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-446,"Really good clean food with great customer service - I absolutely will be back here when in the area . The only thing that would make this place better is if they offer some sort of gluten free menu option, or at least a note on their regular menus to let people know which dishes are safe for those who need it! This can't really even count as an ""option"" these days anyway... like all restaurants should have one available (and most do). It's very common and you don't want anyone eating around someone else just because your options aren "" T clearly marked!!!"

Human,yelp-447,"Walked in here looking for a cute skirt for my birthday dinner. First thing that caught my attention was the really weird smell. It was like foul cleaner and BO. Totally gross. Sucked it up and looked around since they had some cute clothes. Nothing is really in any kind of order, so I literally circled the store 3 times and found skirts in different places each time. Kind of bothersome to me. I never spoke to anyone and none of the employees spoke to me. I wasn't in the mood to chitchat, but it didn't look like they approached ANY customers. So heads up for those who don't like to ask for help. Quality of fabric isn't spectacular on most garments, and seems like it wouldn't last too many washings - unless you hand-washed it perhaps. The dresses are pretty cute, though, and I may come back to try some on for a wedding in the future. On second thought.... I don't want my clothes to smell like the store. Scratch that. Um.... Good lighting?"

BigScience,yelp-447,"Walked in here looking for a cute skirt for my birthday dinner. First thing that caught my attention was the really weird smell. It was like foul cleaner and BO. I never buy clothes from Ann Taylor because of their horrible customer service, but this place did not live up to the bad reputation. I am very picky about what I'm buying so when something smells dirty or has chemicals on it, I don't want anything at all. Before taking off any fabric (including jeans), you have to blot them thoroughly with paper towels first. If I'm honest, pretty much everything I bought here had some sort of threadbare hole where there wasn't even one cut out. You can tell they are just transplanting garments from other stores or places instead of making them by hand themselves. The shoes, however were nice and comfortable! They also do custom sizes if needed! This store is run along the same lines as Nordstrom - there's nothing special about these things. They're average good qualityprice ratio-wise. (They might be lower priced than TJ Maxx due to having less overhead.) But they're definitely nowhere near new-fashionable or trendy. ...and you're right...the stuff looks terrible, no matter how cute it may sound online!! Oh well, they'll wear it eventually... The closest comparison I'd make would be Michael Kors..Their products are decent though it's hard to find items that's unique to them.. Michael Kors brand doesn't sell ""low-quality"" articles..it sells ""average-priced"" merchandise....I'm sure those who claim otherwise only know how to shop too many times"
Tsinghua,yelp-447,Walked in here looking for a cute skirt for my birthday dinner. First thing that caught my attention was the really weird smell. It was like foul cleaner and BO.. not a nice smell at all. So I started looking for skirts and a top. Nothing really caught my eye. I decided to just go for it and just get something on sale. I got a long-sleeved shirt for 10.00 and a skirt for 15.00. The skirt is super cute and fits me like a glove. I'm happy with the deal. I am so not a bargain shopper. I have a hard time letting a price tag go. I just have to try something on to see if it fits. I'm not really sure if I'm a bargain shopper or not.
PaLM,yelp-447,"Walked in here looking for a cute skirt for my birthday dinner. First thing that caught my attention was the really weird smell. It was like foul cleaner and BO. I looked around and the store was pretty empty, which was weird because it was usually pretty busy. I walked up to the counter and the girl working there was pretty rude. She didn't even make eye contact with me and just asked what I was looking for. I told her I was looking for a skirt and she just pointed to a rack in the corner and said ""Over there."" I went over and looked at the skirts and they were all pretty ugly. I didn't see anything I liked so I went back to the counter and asked the girl if she had anything else. She just rolled her eyes and said ""No, that's all we have."" I was really disappointed and I left the store. I went to another store and found a really cute skirt that I loved. I'm so glad I didn't buy anything from that first store."

I stayed here during my trip through Italy last year January 2012 and enjoyed my stay immensely. My wife and I booked two double rooms overlooking the Piazza San Marco which can be accessed via stairs downstairs. Each room has its own balcony offering stunning cityscape views. Both beds were big enough for 2 adults. All bathroom facilities were fully equipped. My only criticism of this hotel, albeit small, is that although the air conditioning worked well each evening it could use improving due to having ice build-up inside the unit."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-449,"The hostess was not able to help when we asked where our party's reserved table was located (probably because no one updated the iPad, she was completely incapable of problem -solving). We ended up in a corner booth. At least it wasn't next door and I could keep an eye on her while still enjoying my meal! This is only half true...there were issues with seating at another restaurant that evening so luckily they allowed me time for us both go back there after dinner rather than immediately going upstairs as planned due entirely their own mistakes....and yes he has never been struck by lightning either LOL"
Human,yelp-449,"The hostess was not able to help when we asked where our party's reserved table was located (probably because no one updated the iPad, she was completely incapable of problem solving) So we missed the surprise for our friends b day because not a single staff member was able or willing to assist us, they avoided eye contact, one server actually pretended not to see me, I was 2 feet from her. Service ultimately was slow but friendly. The pretzel app was very yummy and the dinner was good, sliders. The place is too big for efficiency or they need to hire problem solvers. If you have time on your hands the food is good, loud and live music too. Only 2 stars for ruining the surprise party."

When we finally found our table, which was by the kitchen and not very inviting, the waitress was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the ""family style"" tapas and shared several dishes. The food was delicious and the portions were generous. We also ordered several cocktails, which were all well made. The service was very good overall and we enjoyed our meal. However, the location by the kitchen was not ideal and the restaurant was very noisy."

How am I supposed to order food if they can't even understand I'm sorry to hear that you had a frustrating experience placing your delivery order. You might try using a food delivery app or website that allows you to place orders online, in which case you can input all of your information without needing to communicate with someone on the phone. Alternatively, you could try finding another restaurant that you are more comfortable ordering from."

I also tried calling some places for help with pets and try to get them adopted as soon as possible but no luck yet! LOL!

The shampoo for the seats, it was a single wipe down. The exterior of the car, they don't touch it. There are black streaks on the car and I tried to wipe it off with my hands but it's grease.

This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) so it smelled like a fish tank afterward even while driving. I rented vehicles from Budget in July 2020 for two weeks in Utah and this was my second time using them. The first visit there were no problems with the rental car but that has changed since then. First of all, when you decide to use THEIR app to reserve your vehicle online, you are asked if you want an automatic or manual transmission - NOTHING about this is mentioned anywhere else until you arrive at their location which means it's up to you; however, once you're sitting down in front of one of these cars, the lady who's taking care of you doesn't offer any suggestions other than what she says will work - SO don't ask her anything beyond ""will it do 120?"" She also just assumed we wanted gasoline (automatically suggested by their app), although most people would have said diesel as cheaper. Another problem I've experienced over the last week: I'm not sure how many times they tried to charge me 69 only to find out later that the credit card company refunded only 20! Not enough money to pay for parking either - BUT that's another story... My grandmother got sick with covid and ended up going into ICU. After a few days of being intubated she needed a heart transplant. Her family raised almost 30k towards that operation through crowdfunding website Indiegogo. A couple of months ago my wife and I started helping raise funds via GoFundMe. We've collected 10050 till date.

Tsinghua,yelp-452,"Okay place, but watch out for the bar tenders who do funny math and ask you if you are sure that you want your change back. I suppose those are'typical' bar tenders. The food is okay and the drinks are priced fairly, but the place is in the same league as those other places. Don't be fooled by the name. This place is NOT on the coast. The building is pretty much falling apart. The outside has the most pathetic decor, the outside patio is filthy, the windows are filthy, the interior is filthy, and the pool area is filthy.

I think they need to be closed down. This place was pretty good. The staff was friendly and the food was very good. They do serve the food a little hot but they still got the food hot when we asked for it. I would definitely come back. I have had many different cocktails here and all have been good.

You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. I love reading these poems. When we started our family my husband asked me what i wanted him to bring home from Thailand - my answer was ""my journals."" He didnt understand why I would say such a thing? To this day he doesn't know how much they mean to me.. Thanks for sharing these beautiful days.. It's always great to see another writer take time off her writing...to reflect and reconnect with herself-this poem really resonates with me What a wonderful way to start one's week....a little poetry after a long week makes everything seem clearer somehow:o) It sounds like you're planning quite a few events where parents will gather together - I'm looking forward to seeing them! There were lots of good discussions about SPD ASD shared last night: I'm sorry to hear about your son. Even the simplest things before dropping his activities due to COVID19 seems beyond difficult right now. One thing I've noticed lately that helps many children manage their anxiety (s) is having some kind of daily routine set up. For example-if it's school morning, brush teeth, put on clothes, get ready for school. For other kids, it's simply getting dressed each morning especially since there may not yet be uniforms available. Or doing laundry every couple weeks or feeding yourself etc... A lot of families don't have security camera systems installed to protect against potential burglaries. However, burglars often target places without surveillance cameras. According to experts, security cameras deter thieves. In fact, installing security cameras increase safety and prevent crime as well as help law enforcement catch criminals red-handed. In addition, domestic violence cases involving spouses also rose sharply following the pandemic lockdown period leading up to April 2020 compared to same months just a year earlier according to USA Today. However, based on estimates, property crimes increased 9 while violent crimes dropped 11 between 2019 and 2020 - with assaults falling 42 and rapes down 38. Still, rising rates of sexual abuse reported online were concerning. A recent study revealed that 18 of women ages 18-24 said threats of physical harm had either occurred or continued to occur within two years of reporting being sexually victimized, though only 3 reported legal action to stop perpetrators' behavior. Experts believe that increasing numbers of victims seeking assistance could indicate broader changes occurring related to gender norms, mental health issues and lack of resources. Doing exercise regularly keeps body fit and healthy which reduces chances of diseases. It improves overall well-being and mood. Daily walking for 30 minutes or less increases blood flow around muscles, joints, brain, organs, nervous system and heart. Regular practice of walking releases endorphins into the body thus improving memory"
Eleuther-AI,yelp-452,"Okay place, but watch out for the bar tenders who do funny math and ask you if you are sure that you want your change back. I suppose those are'typical of New York? I was amused by how much they charged per drink... 4 as a beer or soda is not bad at all (in comparison to other places). The food wasn't amazing either - poached eggs with gruyere cheese were good (10), when my wife ordered chicken pot pie it had too many noodles in there so she sent half away which felt like taking 2 steps backwards instead sending her home hungry...but hey what can ya win right!?!"
PaLM,yelp-453,"I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed. I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale. My wife had the chile relleno. The posole was watery and bland, the tuna was dry and overcooked, and the tamale was soggy and tasteless. My wife's chile relleno was better, but it was still too salty. The service was also poor. Our waitress was inattentive and our food took over an hour to arrive. We will not be returning to this restaurant."
LLAMA,yelp-453,"I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed. I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale. My wife had the chile relleno. The tamale was delicious, but the posole was overcooked and the shrimp tasted like frozen shrimp. The tuna was okay, but the portion was small and it lacked flavor. The chile relleno was the only dish that was really good. The service was great and the drinks were great. We were seated outside and it was a perfect evening for it. I would recommend just going for the margaritas and appetizers and going somewhere else for dinner. As a local, I am always on the look out for good restaurants in the area. I tried Posada for the first time recently and I'm glad I did. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. The server was very attentive and made sure everything was perfect for us. The atmosphere was quiet and we were able to talk without having to yell. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat. My wife and I have been to Posada on two occasions in the past month and have been very impressed with the quality and service each time. We have been to many of the restaurants in the valley and it is good to see this high level of service and quality. We have had the short rib tacos, the short rib posole, the almond crusted trout, the fish ceviche, and the shrimp tacos. All of the dishes were fantastic and full of flavor. The staff is very attentive and seems to really care. We will definitely be back again and recommend Posada to our friends. We went to Posada for the first time for a drink and appetizers. We were greeted and seated immediately. We ordered the potato tacos and the shrimp ceviche. Both were outstanding. We had a drink at the bar and our server, Craig, was very attentive. We look forward to having dinner there in the future. We were in for the first time on a Sunday evening for a quick drink and an appetizer. We were greeted and seated immediately and were waited on promptly. We had the potato tacos and the shrimp ceviche. Both were very good. We look forward to coming back and trying the dinner menu. We had dinner on a Saturday evening at Posada. The food was excellent and the service was attentive. We sat at the bar for a drink before dinner and Craig was a great bartender. We had the short rib tacos, the posole, the chile relleno, and the shrimp tamale. All of the dishes were very good. The only issue is the restaurant is so popular that it is very loud inside. We sat at the bar and were able to talk but the patio was very loud. I would highly recommend Posada for dinner. We had a great dinner at Posada on a Friday night. We arrived early and had a drink at the bar before dinner. We were seated at a table and were waited on promptly. We had the scallop ceviche, the short rib tacos, the posole, the chile relleno, and the shrimp tamale. All of the dishes were excellent. The only complaint was the restaurant was very loud and hard to talk at our table. We had dinner at Posada last night. It was the second time we have been to the restaurant and we were not disappointed. We had the short rib tacos and the short rib posole as our starters. Both were very good. We had the tuna tacos and the enchiladas for our main course. Everything was very good and service was great. The only issue is the restaurant is very loud and hard to have a conversation. My wife and I have been to Posada several times and it never disappoints. The service is always great and the food is always delicious. We had the shrimp ceviche, the duck tacos, and the shrimp tamale. All of the dishes were excellent and the service was great. We will definitely be back.

While they were good enough dishes in themselves (the rice with beans chicken that accompanied my husband's burrito would have been better) there wasn't an emphasis on freshness or flavor associated wtih them as is usually seen at La Casita where you can tell it just came off of their stove wo a lot being added besides salt - instead we got ""comfort food"" i guess... The hominy soup tasted like watery saliva from someone who hasn't brushed his teeth yet day! The chunks floating around weren'tthe best either...absolutely disgusting!!! And so much tasteless chili mix left behind once scooped up meant nothing else could be eaten after finishing your bowl except maybe some fruit until all traces disappeared!! Talk about not taking excellent care when preparing these homemade meals!!!! Add bad service which ranged between subpar AND rude waiters handling our table without gloves, wiping dirty tables afterwards while still wearing used aprons etc., even forgetting napkins basking under one foot during hot weather then walking away leaving customers sitting alone waiting another 20 minutes before bringing us new ones!!!!!!!!! So sad how far gone things are now compared what people know back home near Ventura by simple restaurants such El Corral de las Flores el Meson del Alma y various others serving superb Mexican Cuisine!! We will never go here again since no words come close describing its poor quality nor customer friendly staff service.

Tsinghua,yelp-453,"I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed. I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale. My wife had the chile relleno. The posole was ok, but the corn in the cornbread was mushy and not fluffy. The seafood was disappointing, the tuna was not tender, and the shrimp were tough and not seasoned well. The tamale was ok. I would have loved to have the posole a little more but it was not bad. Overall, the meal was not as good as I thought it would be, but it was ok. Was this review helpful to you? Wait, you're the expert. If you've been to or used Cafe Margarita, leave a review."

I'm sorry to hear that your dining experience did not meet your expectations. Can you tell me more about what specifically you found disappointing about each dish? This will help me provide more targeted assistance in getting the issue resolved. Additionally, have you spoken to the restaurant staff or management about your concerns?

BigScience,yelp-453,"I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed. I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale. My wife had the chile relleno. The guacamole was nice, not too sweet, the tortilla chips were good even if they tasted like breading (maybe because it was fried), but overall a very disappointing experience. The restaurant is great; there's always something going on inside or outside. We've been eating at El Pariente since 2007 now, so it's definitely date with our history of dining in Guadalajara. My husband threw up during his first visit! Needless to say we never went back that night. Other than being gross as hell my husband wasn't feeling 100 afterward either! This place has an amazing menu where everything sounds delicious! Even though I'm less foodie these days it's still fun checking out new places around town! We stayed here on vacation over Christmas break 2014. It was hard hitting heat by day, and cold nights when we visited. So long story short: we really enjoyed it all except the crappy service from the front desk. They said people would be coming in soon - and then no one showed up - despite us asking several times. This lasted until 3:00am. Finally someone came in and took care of our needs. When asked why there wasn't anyone else, their response? ""We don't have any staff."" Then about 30 minutes later the same woman returned saying she was just leaving. She left again shortly thereafter. Best part? Her name was Hope - obviously named appropriately considering her attitude. (It should also be noted, however, that her behavior did nothing to help increase customer satisfaction)"
BigScience,yelp-454,"They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and entered for 9:45pm. Late, but we're not complaining. The place is beautiful in all its glitzy glory; an arabesque of light shining off panels made out of gold leaf. Their entertainment program was a bit disappointing; it consisted mostly of some nice choreographies by dancers pretending they were dancing with leopards or lions or tigers - cute though! But there's nothing more enticing than seeing animals actually lively around your ears! As soon as I saw that banana bread cake, my mouth watered and since it's been ages since I've had one... But once again, life got in the way...so instead, I opted for vanilla cupcakes which are super easy and delicious My boyfriend loved them so much..I think this recipe will definitely be going into his repertoire of recipes to make at home too Oh yeah....and speaking of desserts here are 5 other yummy ones from Alex's menu: Banana Bread Cake, Lemon Pound Cake, Sticky Date Cups, Chocolate Cheesecake Raspberry Shortbread Cookies.

Hopefully you'll have better luck next time ...you've certainly given yourself plenty of chances!!! What a beautiful spot!!!!!!! Just wanted to let you know I'll try the banana bread cake tomorrow morning with my granddaughters!! The French language is considered very difficult because it shares many similarities between words and languages such as Spanish, Italian and German. A translation service provider must understand how each word works within the context of written texts based on the target country's natural vocabulary rules and cultural norms. Translating technical documents requires specialized knowledge due to the specific requirements set forth by people working in different industries. To provide translated content that keeps pace with technological advances, translators need access to reliable sources regarding current gadgets and products used daily throughout the world. A company needs a linguist whose skills go beyond mere linguistic comprehension in order to be able to produce quality translations quickly and efficiently. When hiring a translator, ask questions related to: Language proficiency tests also give companies insight into whether an employee possesses the necessary experience to translate text accurately. Many agencies use internal test manuals to assess candidates' abilities before assigning work to them. There may come a point where clients request proofreading services after receiving a document that's already undergone editing processes. Proofreading involves validating errors, checking grammar usage, and evaluating if any sentences contain grammatical inconsistencies. The person responsible for performing the job would likely review every sentence individually using standard dictionaries and relevant online tools."
Human,yelp-454,They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and got to the restaurant with 15 minutes to close and thought for sure we would be able to at least grab a to-go frozen hot chocolate but they had shut and locked all windows and doors and the guy cleaning literally ignored my husband knocking on the window 2 feet in front of his face! Horrible service!!!! Places that are so flippant to customers don't deserve to stay in business.
OpenAI,yelp-454,"They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and arrived there 5 minutes before their closing time, but they refused to let us in. I suggest trying another dessert place in the area, perhaps Cafe Lalo or Magnolia Bakery, which also offer delicious treats. It's always best to confirm the closing time before heading out to avoid any disappointment."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-454,"They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and were seated at 8:35pm, still with a few moments left before they closed! Our server was pleasant but not especially attentive; we had no problem flagging down another waitress for refills or wine substitutions though this did require us interrupting her conversation about one customer's issues in restaurant management that she thought could be improved upon by ripping up receipts instead whether he should have been served brown breads etc... A small thing I know.... But it seemed like an example where rather than seeking out advicefeedback herself as our hostess might do when running into such trouble even if its just over serving times then move along already would miss all those points made except perhaps how rude is so unpleasant? (And yes some things are definitely ""too much... Just saying..... She apparently does enjoy talking after work because there isn't any rush since nobody else shows until 11am Sunday morning???? So maybe next time say something nice?. Our table mates loved their dinner which looked fantastic-I later noticed several patrons dining solo while others sat together enjoying each other' s company more important matters eating life doesn' t get better!!"
PaLM,yelp-454,They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and they were closing. They did allow us in to see if we wanted to try a drink and then leave. So I tried a drink and ordered a second one while my wife went to the bathroom. When she came back the bartender was gone and a new one was taking over and they said they couldn't sell me another drink because they were closing. So I asked for my check which they said they couldn't get because the bartender was gone. It was 20 minutes until closing and they refused to serve me another drink. I was so angry that I walked out without paying my bill. I'm not sure if I will ever go back to this place again.
LLAMA,yelp-454,They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and arrived 5 minutes late. The door was locked and the lights were off. They ignored us knocking and ringing the doorbell. I suppose they thought we were late because we were homeless people (we had just come from a fashion show at the Wynn) and not people that they wanted to serve. I have never been treated like this before in my life. Been to Serendipity 3? Share your experiences!
Tsinghua,yelp-454,"They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and got back to our hotel room at 11:30 PM, because we had no other choice. We left in the morning at 6:00 AM to catch the 8:00 AM bus to Xochimilco. Lesson Learned: The bus from Xochimilco to Mexico City was just as crowded and the same price as the bus from Mexico City to Xochimilco. The bus from Xochimilco to Mexico City was just as crowded and the same price as the bus from Mexico City to Xochimilco. Xochimilco is so beautiful. There is no other word for it. We stayed at the Parque de la Reina hotel, which is a block from the main square. The hotel was lovely and the room was lovely, but the pool area was not. The pool area was disgusting. It was as if the hotel management wanted to keep you from having fun and go to the beach. It was a 15 extra fee to use the pool, but it was worth it. We spent most of our time at the beach and a little time at the main square. It was a gorgeous day and we enjoyed ourselves. We had lunch at one of the small restaurants near the main square and then headed to the bus station. Lesson Learned: Take a taxi to the bus station and pay a little extra for a door to door service. We had a terrible experience with the bus station. We were held up at the station for 2 hours because the driver had an argument with the conductor. The bus station is so poorly run. We eventually boarded the bus, but it was packed and uncomfortable. I spent the whole ride praying for us to get off safely. We were a little late for our connecting bus to Mexico City, but the driver was nice and let us on. We were grateful for his kindness. Lesson Learned: Get to your destination as early as possible. The last bus to Mexico City left at 10:30 PM. We were in Mexico City by 12:30 AM. We had a late night because we had no idea how late the bus was. We were so tired that we took the metro from the airport to the hotel. Lesson Learned: You can get to the airport on the metro. It is much more comfortable than taking a taxi and it is much more affordable. The next day, we went to the Parque de la Independencia to see the Mexican Independence Monument and the Teotihuacan ruins. Lesson Learned: Take the Metro to the ruins. It is much cheaper and much faster than taking a taxi. We got off the Metro at the Plaza Roma and walked to the ruins. It took about 15 minutes. We spent the afternoon at the ruins. Lesson Learned: You can see the ruins from the Metro. It is a 20 minute walk to the ruins. You have to pay 10 pesos for a ticket to the ruins. The ticket booth is just a few minutes walk from the Metro. Lesson Learned: Don't get a taxi to the Parque de la Independencia. The taxis charge 50 pesos and are very pushy. It is much cheaper to walk. We took a taxi from the Metro station to the bus station. The taxi driver said he would give us a ride to the bus station for 10 pesos. We had to pay 20 pesos to get to the bus station. It is about a 20 minute walk from the Metro station. Lesson Learned: The bus station is very close to the Metro station. You can walk to the bus station. The taxi drivers will try to charge you more. The bus station has a door to door service. It is cheaper than the taxi. We had a nice lunch at El Centro and then headed to the bus station. The bus to Acapulco left at 10:00 AM. The bus station is very dirty. The bus station is very dirty. There is a line of people waiting to get on the bus. There is a line of people waiting to get on the bus. The bus left at 10:00 AM. The bus is packed and the ride is not fun. We got to Acapulco at 3:00 PM. We walked to the bus station to catch the bus to Todos Santos. Lesson Learned: Take a taxi to the bus station and pay a little extra for a door to door service. We had a terrible experience with the bus station. We were held up at the station for 2 hours because the driver had an argument with the conductor. The bus station is so poorly run."
LLAMA,yelp-455,"Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. Definitely one of the higher quality buffets on the strip. 35 for lunch was not bad at all. The food was very good. The sushi and sashimi were the best I have ever tasted. I would recommend this restaurant. The buffet was nice, but some of the food was not as hot as it should have been. The main reason I come here though is for the dessert buffet. They have the best desserts out of any buffet I've ever been to. It's worth it just for that alone. Awesome Sushi, Great Variety, and a sweet setup. Excellent food!"

PaLM,yelp-455,"Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. Definitely one of the higher quality buffets on the strip. 35 for lunch was a bit steep, but the quality of the food made up for it. I started with the salad bar, which had a nice selection of fresh fruits, vegetables, and dressings. The bread was warm and fresh, and the soup was delicious. For my main course, I had the prime rib, which was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful, and the asparagus was perfectly steamed. I also had a few of the desserts, which were all delicious. Overall, I had a great experience at Le Village Buffet, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality buffet on the strip. Here is a more detailed review of Le Village Buffet: Pros:  High-quality food  Extensive selection of food  Friendly staff  Beautiful setting Cons:  Pricey  Crowded on weekends Overall, I would definitely recommend Le Village Buffet to anyone looking for a high-quality buffet on the strip."
BigScience,yelp-455,"Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. Definitely one of the higher quality buffets on the strip. 35 for lunch was nt bad at all considering it had most everything you'd want to have and plenty...of room. We really enjoyed our meal though I can't say we are big fans of Korean food but this section is pretty tasty. Kasey The Cheesecake Factory has been my go-to restaurant since college (and now that I'm home, it's still top priority). The cake here makes me think ""cheese"" when I see it; never mind how delicious it actually is. I like their cheeses - they don't seem overly greasy or salty; I can almost taste them! They also serve some pretty cool appetizers as well. Although you definitely won't find any veggies in there, you're not missing out too much if that's your thing! Although they do have an extensive wine list, I haven't found many wines I've liked enough to try again after trying just Texas AM Red. It's only slightly sweeter than a standard red, but what type of dessert would be complete without a little sweetness? So recently my family went to Rose's Ice Cream Shoppe breakfast buffet with my mommy friend Jessica from Taste of Home Magazine. When people ask us where we've eaten lately, I always tell them: ""Rose's."" Which isn't literally true-we've visited once before. But every time we're invited back there's something new: pancakes, waffles, eggs benedict, french toast, omelet... We started off with: Pecan French Toast Pancakes featuring softened pecans. For 12 per person they were huge, light fluffy pancakes made even better because of these pecans swirled into them. Topped with whipped cream and strawberries and served with vanilla syrup next to the plate which added more sweetness to each bite. Next up were: Spicy Egg Benedict Huevos Rancheros Panini Made with poached huevos rancheros using fresh egg yolks cooked bottom side down in creamy tomato sauce enhanced with mayonnaise and spices including black pepper, chili powder, cumin, salt garlic clove. Served warm between two slices of bread smothered in cheese then grilled until golden brown. (16) Cornmeal Omelets served hot in panini style with Swiss cheese melted on top and drizzled with maple syrup. (10) These look easy enough to make yourself but honestly? They're best left alone. And lastly Hawaiian Fried Chicken Fingers stuffed with roasted chicken breasts seasoned with lemon juice, green peppercorns, sugar, garlic, basil, thyme, parsley, ginger, cilantro and pineapple and wrapped in white rice paper with lime wedges and salsa fresca on the side. (9) My husband ordered the bourbon bisque steak frites while I decided to take care of the kids and order a Cobb salad. Like everyone else, they provided drinking water. What we both loved most about this experience was the way the staff treated us. It didn't feel like partying with friends in front of TV but rather having a casual get together full of laughs shared around great conversation and laughter."
Human,yelp-455,"Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. Definitely one of the higher quality buffets on the strip. 35 for lunch was a bit steep but the ambiance and the presentation of food was great. They had everything from Korean BBQ, Bone marrow, Kale Salads, pizza, eggs benedict, and home cured bacon.:) The selection of food was excellent although the meats that we tried were all a bit on the salty side... The Kale salad, congi, and eggs benedict were my favorite things of the things I tried. The dessert bar had a very wide selection as well and the portions were small enough where you could grab a few different things without having to worry about not finishing. The icecream and the dark chocolate mouse were my favorite desserts. So if you have a big appetite and want to try a lot of different things, this would be a great place to try the Cosmo. The next time I go it will probably be for dinner though. Too much for lunch. Good to take coworkers, friends, customers, family, and a date."

The seafood station was especially good, with plenty of fresh options like shrimp, crab legs, and sushi. The dessert station was also a hit, with a wide variety of sweets to choose from.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-455,"Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. Definitely one of the higher quality buffets on the strip. 35 for lunch was very reasonable and they did not skimp out with portion size (although it is nothing to be blown away, but certainly decent). The salad bar has both fresh cut as well frozen items which i appreciated since its colder here in Vegas than what we are used too back home or even our normal weather down south The entrees were all okay...nothing spectacularly great however my husband had his usual burger special that he always gets without any issues..this time came up short though....it didn't look different from when I went before other then more sauce drippings coming off onto yours trays table around him.....very weird! He also tried their ribs again this trip while at dinner only because after two visits last year ended badly due skin being left stuck between teeth gums etc......they looked ok although like anything grilledsauced you really need dipping sauces especially if ordering them medium rare instead getting burnt ends lol This visit everything seemed just fine except maybe some extra sweet tea flavor could have helped bring these plentiful tableside-only beverage area drinks together? Overall definitely worth another try next summer tho given your options now"
LLAMA,yelp-456,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close to my home, I would like to share my thoughts on the operation. To start with, I have never had a bad experience at this Starbucks. I am very pleased with the service and the baristas are always very polite and friendly. I would like to say however, that on more than one occasion I have received drinks with the wrong size andor wrong drink type. I understand that mistakes can happen but I would like to point out that it has happened to me at this location more than anywhere else I have been to. I do not understand this, as I am always very specific in what I order. Also, the last few times I have been there, the drinks have been very weak and watery. I do not know if it is the fact that the new 'refresher' beverages have been introduced and they are watering down the coffee and espresso in order to make more of the fruit drinks, but the coffee and espresso shots I have received have been very weak. I do not know if this is a corporate policy or a store policy, but I would recommend that you look into this. I have been a faithful Starbucks customer for many years. I know that you have a wonderful product, but I am very disappointed in your baristas. On the way to work this morning, I stopped at your store on the corner of 7800 W. 111th Street and LaGrange Road in Palos Hills, IL. I ordered a mocha frappacino, no whip cream. I have a very specific way in which I like my drinks. I always ask for 1 pump of mocha, 1 pump of vanilla, and 1 pump of white mocha. I have always received my drinks just the way I like them, until today. I received my drink with 2 pumps of mocha, and no vanilla or white mocha. I returned to the store, and told the barista that I had ordered 1 pump of each. The barista looked at the cup and said, ""I am sorry, I gave you an extra pump of mocha."" Now, I understand that mistakes can happen, but when I returned to the counter to receive my drink, the barista did not even say a word to me. She did not apologize, she did not offer to remake the drink, she did not even acknowledge that I was there. She just stood there staring into space. I had to repeat myself 3 times before she realized that I was there to receive a drink. I have never had such poor customer service anywhere else. I was so disappointed in the service I received today that I have decided to find a new coffee shop. I can not believe that the service would be so poor and that your barista would not even apologize for giving me the wrong drink. I have tried the 'Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf' coffee shop. They are very similar to Starbucks and I have had no problems with them. I am very sorry to say that I will not be returning to Starbucks. I am very disappointed in your store and the poor service I received today. I am a very loyal Starbucks customer. I have been coming to this location for many years and have always been very happy with the service I have received. I have also been to other Starbucks locations on business and have been very pleased with the service I have received there as well. I just wanted to let you know that I had an experience today that is very uncharacteristic of the service I have received from Starbucks in the past. I am very disappointed with the service I received and I hope that this will not occur in the future. I arrived at the Starbucks location on the corner of W. 111th and LaGrange Road in Palos Hills, IL at about 7:45am this morning. When I arrived, there were 2 baristas behind the counter. There was only 1 customer in front of me and there was no line. I ordered my drink and waited for my receipt to print. I stood in front of the barista for about 2 minutes without receiving my receipt. I asked the barista if there was a problem and he said that there was a problem with the printer. He then asked me for my name and began making my drink. When I arrived at the counter to pick up my drink, the barista said that the printer was fixed and gave me my receipt. I said, 'Thank"
Human,yelp-456,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close to where I work, I am forced to frequent it often. It has consistently been slow and the customer service is often as ghetto as the neighborhoods which surround it. This morning, I waited 20 minutes in line and found out that this is the ONLY Starbucks in the country that won't grind a bag of coffee beans because it is not Starbucks coffee. Well Starbucks, you've lost one more customer. I won't be visiting this location again."
PaLM,yelp-456,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close to my workplace, I often stop here for a quick breakfast or lunch. The staff is always friendly and efficient, and the food and drinks are always delicious. One of my favorite things about this Starbucks is the atmosphere. It is bright and airy, with plenty of natural light. The tables are comfortable and there is plenty of seating, so it is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. I also appreciate the fact that this Starbucks offers a variety of food options. In addition to the traditional Starbucks breakfast and lunch items, they also have a selection of pastries, sandwiches, and salads. There is something for everyone at this Starbucks! Overall, I am very satisfied with this Starbucks location. The staff is friendly, the food and drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect. I highly recommend this Starbucks to anyone looking for a great coffee shop experience."
BigScience,yelp-456,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close by my office in Aurora Colorado, where I am currently working with a client that has six different franchisees operating within their territory, it seems only natural that me as well as several other customers would be frequenting. At first glance one might assume that these franchises are nearly identical due to having the same logo, color scheme and brand identity, but upon further inspection there are some conspicuous differences between them such as: Formal vs Non formal: This was not mentioned anywhere during our interview with the manager at the time of purchase. The coffee shop store did mention that they had two seating areas: a more formally dressed area and another less formally dressed; however we were never informed about which side of the counter was considered formally or non-formally arranged till after purchasing the menu. The question then arises why should a person chose either side? Is it purely down to personal preference or does something else exist? Branding and Experience Levels: Although both stores share the same logo and uniformity throughout (color schemes, etc.) there appears to be distinct difference between the way they treat their guests. Area 1: In Area 1 the employees seemed very warm and welcoming whilst also being knowledgeable; whereas in Area 2 we found the opposite. In addition they served us drinks at each order according to what was requested rather than just asking ""Do you want any more water"" like Area 1 staff members preferred doing. They helped without even asking if we wanted anything extra until necessary although perhaps its not always easy to know exactly how much food or drink will take up space before ordering it - depending on your size!"
OpenAI,yelp-456,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close to my home, I was wondering if you could tell me more about the Starbucks Rewards program and any current promotions they might have? Certainly! Starbucks Rewards is a loyalty program that rewards members with exclusive perks, such as free drinks, birthday gifts, and special offers. To join, all you need to do is download the Starbucks mobile app and create an account. With each purchase made using the app or a registered Starbucks card, you'll earn stars which can then be redeemed for free food and drinks. As for promotions, Starbucks often releases seasonal offerings and limited-time flavors that are exclusive to Rewards members. They also frequently offer bonus stars for purchasing certain products or visiting specific locations. Currently, Starbucks is running a promotion for a free drink or food item after your first purchase as a new Rewards member. I hope this helps!"
Tsinghua,yelp-456,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close to where I work, I have been going here for coffee since it opened, and even before. This was a HUGE mistake on my part. I had ordered a venti mocha and a 12 ounce hot chocolate, which was already over 10. The venti mocha was 6.99, and the hot chocolate was 5.49. I tried to order a cappuccino and an iced coffee, and both were over 7. I had to leave my drink on the counter, and was told that they were only serving 6.99 and 5.49 items. I had to wait a long time to get my drinks, and when I did, I felt so guilty. I know this is a business that wants to make money, but they really need to get their prices in line. I have heard of people leaving their coffee on the counter, and they come back with the drink."
PaLM,yelp-457,Sorento's is nearby as are other pizza joints that provide better food and prices.
Tsinghua,yelp-457,"The pizza is overpriced, as is everything else. Also, the food isn't good. The salads weren't fresh and the pizza lacks taste. Fortunately for you, Sorento's is nearby as are many others. Not a good place to eat if you are on a tight budget. Went to this place with a friend, we both had the Chicken Parm. They were both under cooked and over salted. The pizza was no good, we both ended up having to throw it out. I would never go back to this place. It is one of the worst pizza places in San Diego. I tried the garlic cheese, which was like a bowl of mush, and the pepperoni was so hard it was like biting into a brick. I gave up after 14 of the slice. I am very picky about my pizza and will not eat at this place again. Just take a pass. I was there for a wedding. We got there around 7pm. The place was really nice and the staff was friendly. The food was great and it was a good price. The place was full of couples. I had the pecan pie and it was really good. The only thing is that it is very expensive. I will definitely go back.

Great authentic menu selection and ingredients used in each dish is top notch. We had the chicken breast special tonight and it was absolutely fantastic We just got back from our most recent trip here and were blown away!!! Our waitress Heather went above beyond what she should've done while checking us out...she even asked if there would be any kind of problem wour reserved table (which wasn't her job) and instead walked right down the street and found us another spot. She also checked me into my room before leaving. Will definitely return!!! I love going here whenever I'm in SoCal....great food, atmosphere excellent friendly staff. A definite must-try! Highly recommend! Enjoyed your meal very much, especially the lobster bisque. The only thing I'd change about the dinner portion; add fries."
LLAMA,yelp-457,"The pizza is overpriced, as is everything else. Also, the food isn't good. The salads weren't fresh and the pizza lacks taste. Fortunately for you, Sorento's is nearby as are several other establishments. I'm sure I'll go back in the next year, but I'll be looking for a better deal, or maybe I'll just go to Sorrento's. My girlfriend and I had dinner last night and it was OK. I had a salad with chicken and she had a salad with salmon. Both were good, but a bit bland. The wait staff was attentive, but the food was average. My wife and I have been there twice for lunch and twice for dinner. Both lunches were fantastic. The dinners were good, but not up to the standards of the lunches. This place is best for lunch. The food is good and the prices are reasonable. The wait staff is attentive and the atmosphere is nice. We love this place. We have never had a bad meal. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. The food is fantastic. We had dinner there last night. The service was attentive. The food was pretty good, but not worth the money. The prices were outrageous."

OpenAI,yelp-458,You have to try their pumpkin with crispy rice and grilled food. It can't really compare to Raku but its the 2nd alternative best to Raku. This place is better Thank you for the recommendation! Do you have any specific dishes in mind that you would recommend trying at this place? And what sets it apart from other similar restaurants?
LLAMA,yelp-458,"You have to try their pumpkin with crispy rice and grilled food. It can't really compare to Raku but its the 2nd alternative best to Raku. This place is better than Sapporo. -the edamame was really salty! -all of the above are personal preference. -their beer was good though, served cold. The food is good and the service is good. Great Japanese food! We love their catering service as well! We went to Naked Fish for the first time. When we asked if we could sit outside, we were told no, that they were taking a reservation and if we wanted to sit outside we could wait 20 minutes. We waited 20 minutes, and then we were told that the reservation had not arrived, and that we could sit outside. Once we were seated, the food was great. The service was not. It was very rushed, and we felt ignored. The waitress never refilled our water glasses, nor did she ask how we were doing. She only asked once if we wanted dessert and then never came back to the table. Overall the food was good, the service was very sub par. We will be dining at Naked Fish. We love their sushi! Naked Fish is great! I love their chicken curry rice! Their sushi is amazing!"

This place is usually not super packed so there is no need to make reservation which is always a plus when you in the mood for good japanese food."
OpenAI,yelp-459,"Pretty good service, but really busy and noisy!!

BigScience,yelp-459,"Pretty good service, but really busy and noisy!! It gets a little overwhelming because the sales people are very knowledgeable and bombard you with useless techy information to I guess sell more cars, so just chill out! The car was great. Prices were fair. Buying my first vehicle from this dealership has been an absolute pleasure through every step of the way including financing. All the staff at Motor City Ford have truly demonstrated integrity in all that they do; from the salesman who worked on getting me into my brand new vehicle right up until the moment he delivered it over five hours late (which is why we were only able to get our paperwork signed that day), to the finance manager overall communication throughout everything felt like familyclient relationship - nothing taken for granted or done without reason. They continually provided us with updates as each transaction progressed which made things much smoother and less stressful than one would think possible when ordering online. If you want a nice buying experience then definitely check them out; even if you're not thinking about purchasing from them yet it's worth checking them out! I bought a truck here yesterday June 11 2020. There guysgirls working there went above and beyond what I expected by being so patient with me during the wait time before i could see the truck and giving me answers anytime i asked questions regarding items listed on the website..i will be going back again soon.. After contacting several others, finally found someone that had their eye on pretty much anything and everyone else said no...this place proved me wrong and gave me exactly what I wanted Driving around town can often cause frustration and aggravation if you're parked far too close to other vehicles. In some cases, drivers may decide to drive off the grass after parking near another person's property rather than trying to negotiate a better spot. But how do parents find a sweet solution? Here are three ideas from Land Rover Discovery owners sharing their experience. ""When I'm driving down the road with my kids behind me, sometimes I'll pull into a space next to someone else to make sure it's safe enough - but that's usually impractical since most spaces aren't large enough. So instead, I've used our Land Rover Discovery Sport's Park Assist system with its live view camera display and sensors to help guide where I should put my car safely while still having plenty of visibility,"" says Mike Kofford, landlord of 5100 N McCulloch Ave., Columbus Circle. ""It detects obstacles ahead of your car using radar, dials them in and shows a virtual picture on the screen, making it easy to know exactly where to stop. My son likes to tell me how smart it looks, too."""

My girlfriends used to come here because they were good sales people and their products were good. But lately they have changed and I think they are starting to lose their edge. I'm sure this is just a small rant but I think there is a lack of knowledge about their products which could be why sales people seem to be more ""salesy.""

They have a great selection of beers and wines, and the cocktails are always creative and delicious. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great dining experience. Here's a specific example of a great experience I had at the Deer Valley location: I went there with my family for dinner one night, and we all had a wonderful time. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. We started our meal with the roasted beet salad, which was absolutely amazing. The beets were perfectly roasted, and the goat cheese and walnuts added a nice touch of flavor. For our main courses, we had the filet mignon, the salmon, and the chicken parmesan. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and the salmon was flaky and delicious. The chicken parmesan was also very good, and the marinara sauce was flavorful and rich. We all finished our meal with the chocolate lava cake, which was the perfect way to end a great meal. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at the Deer Valley location of The Melting Pot.

LLAMA,yelp-462,"First let me say I'm a picky eater love good food a friend took me here so was not my first choice da price was good da food? Let's just say I'm going back. This is by far my favorite restaurant in the area. I've had almost every single thing on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I've been going here for over two years and I've never had to wait for a table. The food is great and the service is always awesome! I tried there chicken and waffles and they were great. I did not like the biscuits or sweet potatoes. I liked the bacon but my husband did not. The ambiance was really good. I really like this place. They have a large variety of options and something for every taste. They have a lot of vegetarian options and a decent amount of vegan options as well. I've never had anything that I didn't like. The one thing that can be a little bit of a pain is they don't take credit cards. I love this restaurant. The wait staff is very attentive and polite. I have never had a bad meal here. The fried catfish is very good and the batter is perfect. I am not a big fan of their sweet potatoes, but I think that's more of a personal preference. I'm glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a restaurant. So i'm not a big fan of waffles, i can eat them for breakfast but not lunch or dinner. So when i was told about this place i was a little skeptical. I went with a friend who ordered chicken and waffles and i ordered the fried chicken with cheese grits. WOW! I wish i was a bigger fan of waffles because these were so good. I've been back several times since and I have yet to be disappointed. Stopped for breakfast and got chicken and waffles. It was amazing. I also got a side of grits. The grits were better than my mothers, and she makes the best grits I've ever had. I will definitely be stopping by when I'm in the area. This place is amazing. I'm from Texas and had never had chicken and waffles before I had them at this restaurant. I've had them several times since and they're still just as good. It's a small restaurant, but the food is outstanding. The service is always great and the food is always fresh and tasty. I've never had a bad meal there. I had the chicken and waffles with a side of grits and i absolutely loved it. I'm not a big fan of waffles but this was so good i could eat it every day. Great food, good service, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere. This place is the best place for breakfast in the area. I'm not a huge breakfast person but this place was so good. I got the chicken and waffles and my friend got the fried chicken and cheese grits. I loved the chicken and waffles so much I had to get them again. I love this place.

Tsinghua,yelp-462,"First let me say I'm a picky eater love good food a friend took me here so was not my first choice da price was good da food? Let's just say we had an average experience. You'll be better off if you go to a Mexican place. There was a nice wait time and they gave us an extra roll to eat. If you have no other place to go I guess it's a good choice. Very good hot dogs, however, we had to wait for our order to come out. When it did, it was too cold. My husband ate one and then went to the restroom. He came back and said that the sausage was hard and cold. My son had one and he also said that it was cold. I am a meat eater, so I had one. It was too cold. The bun was very nice. We will not be back. Reviewer is a: mom of 2 from: Phoenix, AZ A.L. 11192016 10:07 AM very tasty I'm not a hot dog lover, but the hot dog was very good. I ate the whole thing in about 20 minutes. It was juicy and not too greasy. I'm glad I tried it. Reviewer is a: Mom of 2 from: Phoenix, AZ A.L. 11122016 11:27 AM Hot dog is delicious! My husband ordered the combo and the hot dog was the best I've ever had! It was so juicy and the chili was delicious! The bun was a little on the small side, but that was not an issue. Overall a great meal! Reviewer is a: Registered User from: Phoenix, AZ D.M. 10282016 10:39 AM Great hot dog! I've never had a better hot dog.

I also enjoyed the chili, but it was a little on the spicy side for me. I would like to have had the option of extra toppings, but this was a good choice for me. The hot dog was just average for me, but the prices were high. I would like to try a different hot dog. Reviewer is a: Registered User from: Phoenix, AZ M.S. 10252016 7:58 AM Delicious and Good Value I loved the hot dog and the chili. The toppings were perfect and the bun was fluffy.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in late May 2017. I will start off by saying this was a 2 night stay on business and we were there for 1 day. We had been at this hotel for 3 years and always have a great stay. We were very impressed with the new updated look of the hotel. It was a nice surprise to see all the new features they have added to the hotel. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The breakfast was awesome. We had the eggs benedict, scrambled eggs and sausage. I also ordered the waffles and had the french toast. It was very good. The room was very nice and had a new updated look to it. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and it was nice and spacious. The rooms were very clean. We would definitely stay here again. I would give this hotel a 4.5 out of 5 stars.

BigScience,yelp-464,"I hate this center it would so hard to get in and out of; especially on weekends and during the holidays. I have almost been hit a handful of times by cars coming from both directions trying to make turns at stop signs. If you are going over the bridge, be aware that I-80 is immediately downriver from the bridge and there can be traffic problems if it rains heavily or for any reason water comes up onto the road. If possible, avoid getting lost along this stretch of route because drivers regularly drive straight into ditches without seeing them. The only real problem I'd say about driving here is that it's actually quite easy to get around. The roads aren't bad but maybe not large enough - they do go through some very rural areas where there's no one else living nearby (you'll just see cows). But overall I'm really glad we live here!"

As you can see we are pretty small, but they still did NOT provide us with transportation services for our food shopping or any other trips outside that building like grocery stores etc... Our only option was if my daughter wanted some ice cream she had walk down two flights (at least) stairs then go back up again - yikes!! So overall....it's just too far away from everything else..and as much money went into getting here maybe there should be more than one location? Maybe something closer by where everyone lives??"

I have been shopping at this location for 6 months and every time I visit there is a problem with something. I have purchased expensive items and not received the right change back. I have been shorted. The service is terrible. The girls are just so mean. It is almost impossible to get help from a cashier because they are constantly in the back chatting. I won't be visiting this store any more. I have been going to this location for a while and it is very clean. The service is fast and they have a great selection of items. The cashiers are always very friendly and helpful. The employees at this location are very friendly and helpful. The service is fast and they have a great selection of items.

Human,yelp-465,"It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends wanted to go there to see Sean Tyas. I figured that maybe WK read some of the pitiful reviews on here and changed their shit. Nope, they haven't. In fact, I think they actually read the reviews and decided to expound on their absolute worst-service ever. So what happened last night? STRIKE 1: Well, first off, the club was not busy - not at 10:45 when we got there or at 1am. I guess the word is out about how fucking terrible this place is. But really, whatever, who cares - a huge headliner was not there so I can understand. STRIKE 2: I stuck with beer this time because last time the drinks were terrible and they charge Vegas Holiday prices. However, no fail.... they can't even do beer right. What the hell is up with their skimpy beer selection? Oh-yeah! I forgot.... they want to limit you to their liquor and charge you some ungodly amount. So I drank Stella Artois in a can - interesting. STRIKE 3: I like to dance and get into my music. When I am not dancing I like to stand as close as I can to the subwoofer and feel my music. I found my spot and I got a tap on my shoulder from the bouncer Um, move.... you can't stand here. Apparently I was too close to the VIP table. STRIKE 4: So I was there with my Irish friend who this is his last weekend.... and also my friend who was having a bad week. I figured, hey, let's get a shot. I'll go with an easy one - how about a Alabama Slammer Mr. Bartender? No...? You can't make that one? What.... no sloe gin? Gebuz Christmas. What the hell kind of bar are you? STRIKE 5: A couple minutes later.... how about this shot.... a Purple Hooter? What response did I get? A sorry we don't have Raspberry Liqueur would have been sufficient but instead I got dude, come back when you have a normal shot as he threw his bar towel down at me. Fuck off dude. I ended up saying, make me a shot, anything, fuck it. I think he made some sort of lemon drop variation. He's lucky I turn into a lover and not a fighter when I drink because I would have beat his ass. STRIKE 6: I'm standing outside when one of my group comes up and tells me that my brother got kicked out. I asked why and they said that he was too drunk. I laughed, my brother can be black out drunk and still look sober.... and he got kicked out? Get real. I assure you that he was not too drunk as I was drinking the same amount as him and I felt buzzed at most. Kick one of my group out and we all leave. I honestly think that they kick people out just to cause drama and have people walking by think that the club is all exclusive. That and the managers and bouncers have ego problems where they only feel good about themselves if they push people around and treat them like shit. I wouldn't doubt it if they read these reviews and masturbate to them at their work meetings. I had this place on my Scottsdale ban list before but apparently I didn't have it on my perma-ban list. It is definitely there now. Read the other reviews - many others are boycotting this place too. I honestly think that whoever the owner is has a massive insurance plan on his building and he is just hoping that someone will come by and burn it down and they can cash in on the insurance. There is absolutely no other logic as to why any establishment would be continually and aggressively offering the worst service in Scottsdale."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-465,"It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends insisted that it was ""new management"" and promised they would fix everything right away, so we went in anyway... And boy did he deliver!!! We had a great time dancing our asses off! Even though his wife is pregnant with their first child; Scott still made sure all patrons were happy from start till finish (especially me)! He gave credit where due for people who came out on top as well which definitely deserves commendation too!! This guy truly knows how much hard work goes into making an event successful when you've got your team working together like him does makes things almost effortless The place seemed fairly new inside however there are problems once again at nighttime most likely because every partyclub owner wants fair share without giving anything up or nothing extra just receives notoriety by saying no deals ever happen here.. So if someone can make money doing what everyone else already gets paid handsomely then go ahead take advantage... But only until something better comes along.; Otherwise stay tuned cause its always going down hill before getting any good!!!! The owners bring more drama than anyone should have dealt themselves after taking over yet another popular club bar business;. Once upon some jerk decided she wanted her own area upstairs within close proximity seating etc.... That's why now many nights both downstairs AND UPSTAIRS areas fill way past capacity wth mostly younger individuals enjoying drinks while listening music, having fun talking about meaningless bullshit mainly concerning females being put downs rather harshly - thus creating unnecessary conflicts between groups.This especially happens during weeknights around 1am... No matter whom u talk 2 give ur ear.. They will tell ya ""NO"" U CAN'T GET IN THAT AREA ITS CLOSED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR THE NIGHT! Then turns red face quickly looking sidewards pretending NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THEM PLUS NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT!! These guys know exactly wheres certain key spots throughout building packed full til late hours allowing them easy access later.... Hence stealing revenue meant specifically fpr desired purpose i guess period..... Ineffective decision makers causing other businesses loss?????? Money wasted lemmings thinkin ignorant fools r really free thinkers??...... WTF happened???"
PaLM,yelp-465,"It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends, Jessica, begged me to come with her. She said she was going through a rough patch and needed some company. I reluctantly agreed, but I had a bad feeling about this. When we got to the club, it was packed. The music was so loud that I could barely hear myself think. Jessica immediately grabbed my hand and dragged me onto the dance floor. We danced for a while, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Suddenly, I felt someone grab my arm. I turned around and saw a man standing behind me. He was tall and muscular, with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. He smiled at me and said, ""Hi, I'm Jake."" I didn't say anything. I just stared at him, trying to figure out what he wanted. ""I'm here with Jessica,"" he said. ""She told me to come find you."" I looked over at Jessica, who was dancing with another guy. She saw me looking at her and waved. ""I'm going to go dance with Jessica,"" I said to Jake. ""Okay,"" he said. ""I'll see you later."" I turned and walked away from Jake. I found Jessica and told her that I was going to get a drink. She said okay and went back to dancing. I got a drink at the bar and sat down at a table. I took a sip of my drink and looked around the club. It was still as loud and crowded as it had been when we first got there. I couldn't believe that Jessica wanted to come to this place. I finished my drink and got up from the table. I was about to leave when I saw Jake again. He was standing in the middle of the dance floor, dancing with Jessica. I watched them for a moment. They were laughing and having a good time. I felt a pang of jealousy. I wished I could be like them, carefree and happy. I turned and walked away from the club. As I walked, I thought about Jake and Jessica. I wondered what they were doing together. Were they just friends, or was there something more going on? I didn't know the answer to that question, but I knew that I didn't like it. I didn't like the way Jake looked at Jessica, or the way she looked at him. I walked out of the club and into the cool night air. I took a deep breath and started walking home. I didn't know what the future held, but I knew that I didn't want to be with Jessica anymore. I walked for a while, until I got to my apartment building. I went inside and up to my apartment. I closed the door behind me and leaned against it. I was exhausted. I went to the kitchen and poured myself a glass of water. I took a sip and then went into the living room. I sat down on the couch and turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, but nothing caught my interest. I turned off the TV and lay down on the couch. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but I couldn't stop thinking about Jake and Jessica. I got up from the couch and went to the window. I looked out at the city below. It was still dark, but the sun was starting to rise. I thought about all the things that had happened in the past few months. I thought about my relationship with Jessica, and how it had ended. I thought about Jake, and how he had come into my life and changed everything. I didn't know what the future held, but I knew that I had to move on. I had to let go of the past and start a new chapter in my life. I took a deep breath and turned away from the window. I went back to the couch and lay down. I closed my eyes and this time I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was morning. I got out of bed and went to the kitchen. I made myself some coffee and toast. I sat down at the table and ate my breakfast. I thought about everything that had happened the night before. I knew that I had made the right decision to end my relationship with Jessica. I was ready to move on with my life. I was ready to start a new chapter. I finished my breakfast and went to the bathroom to get ready for work. I took a shower and got dressed. I put on my makeup and brushed my hair. I looked at myself in the mirror and smiled. I was ready for anything. I"
BigScience,yelp-465,"It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends and I had a drink, and we decided that it was time for another night out. As soon as they opened up at 11:30 p.m., everyone there seemed genuinely surprised when I showed up on our little table next to them. They gave me their apologies for not getting through sooner because they were so busy with all the customers coming in. Except for some girls who looked like they'd just got off work from five different jobs at once, most people there are regulars here. Like us: Gourmet Burgers only opens until 11pm every day except Sundays or sometimes even then, which seems pretty good considering how many other restaurants have closed by now after having gone bankrupt. We ordered what is basically an endless supply of burgers, fries (which come in two sizes), drinks, desserts and coffee. We didn't order any alcoholic beverages, though we did get free refills and put-downs whenever we wanted fresh juice or lemonade. The salad bar also comes with a few choices each weekday, including something called ""cheese salads"" that include bacon bits and roasted corn. It reminded me a lot of tacos, although I don't think anyone can toss together cheesy taco filling while eating french fries, tastes weird. I always seem to request cheese fries over regular ones too; it's easier if you go counter-clockwise."
Tsinghua,yelp-465,"It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends had a bachelor party here last week and I was asked to be the DJ. It was my first time DJing at Wild Knight. They were not pleased with the music selection that I made and I guess I am not to blame for it. The first 20 minutes of the night were spent complaining to me about my choice of music and then they proceeded to put on some rap music. I was in the middle of a well-known tune when a guest asked me to play something else and so I asked the DJ who was standing behind me to change the song. He refused and he and his friends started to berate me. I was too angry to respond and that was the last thing I heard before they all left. A guy from the guest list came up to me later and asked me to keep the record on the turntables because they will be coming back. I could not believe it. I told him that I would play whatever he wanted to hear and I was going to play it until I was asked to stop. A few minutes later, a guest came up to me and asked me to stop playing the song because they would not be able to sleep tonight. I was so pissed off that I could not care less about my sleep and I told him to do whatever he wanted to. I could not understand why these people do not like the music I am playing. I asked a friend of mine who was at the party why they do not like the music I am playing. He told me that they have not heard anything good since I left. That hurt my feelings a lot. I was the one who brought in the new music and made sure that the quality of the music was better than ever before. Why would they not like the music that I played? I guess it was just not their type of music. I have to give them credit for being good enough to put up with my DJing style. I was surprised that I had a good turnout that night. My friend's friend was so impressed that she had to tell me how great I was. She said that she could not believe that I was able to play that kind of music at Wild Knight. I am not sure if she was just saying that to make me feel good or she really was that impressed. I guess that I have to play more often at Wild Knight so that I can prove to everyone that I am the real deal. That's my plan for the future. I think I am just too old to be playing at bars. I need to get out there and do some real work. Well, that is my take on Wild Knight. I am going to write more on this topic as I go. I am just too tired to write right now.

LLAMA,yelp-465,"It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends is moving away so I came back. A lot of the people that I used to see here were gone, so it looks like the regulars are slowly fading away and new people are taking their place. The quality of the girls and the quantity of the crowd is almost the same as last time. Overall, Wild Knight is still the same as I remember. I was really drunk by the time I got here so my memory is hazy. I remember approaching a group of girls, who initially looked interested. The Asian girl in the group was really cute. I talked to them for a while. The Asian girl and I really hit it off. We were having a great conversation and she was very interested in me. I felt really confident with her. We were the only ones in the group talking to each other. I was really excited about this prospect. She really liked me but she was leaving with her friends. She wanted me to come along but I did not want to leave my friends. I told her that I would catch up with her. Unfortunately, that was the last I saw of her. A while later, I approached another group. There was one girl in this group who looked very cute. I could tell from her smile that she liked me. As I was talking to her, I could feel a warmth coming from her. She seemed to really like me. However, she was leaving with her friends so I told her that I would catch up with her. Unfortunately, that was the last time I saw her. I approached another group of girls, who were dancing near the DJ booth. I talked to them for a while and they seemed to like me. There was a blonde girl in this group who really liked me. She was very cute. I asked her where she lived but she did not answer me. She was pretty drunk. I talked to her for a while but she was starting to lose interest in me. I left her and started talking to her friend. I asked her where she lived and she said New Rochelle. I told her that I live in Yonkers. She seemed interested in me but she had to go to the bathroom. I waited for her outside the bathroom. Unfortunately, she never came out. The people here are starting to annoy me. I am sick and tired of talking to people, getting their number, and never seeing them again. I would rather not talk to anyone. At least this way, I will not get disappointed. I talked to one girl for a while and she was really cute. However, she was drunk and she started getting bitchy with me. She started acting like she did not want to be bothered. I left her alone. The only girl that seemed to be interested in me was a girl that I was already talking to earlier in the night. However, she was not that pretty so I did not pay too much attention to her. She was starting to get really interested in me so I got her number. I did not really want to talk to her so I gave her the number of my friend instead. It was a pretty bad night. I talked to a few girls, who seemed interested but I never saw them again. I would rather not talk to anyone. I am sick of getting disappointed. Labels: cute, dance, dj, drunk, girlfriend, house, New Rochelle, night, pretty, quality, quantity, tired, vodka, Wild Knight"
OpenAI,yelp-465,It has been 7 months since I last graced the dance floor of Wild Knight. I vowed never to come back to this shitty establishment but one of my friends has a birthday party there tonight and I feel obliged to go. What advice do you have for me to make the best of this situation?

BigScience,yelp-466,"this place is amazing try the fried mushrooms and wings with ranch and be blown away..........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! We have had a wonderful time here at Beach House. The decor, food, service are all fantastic! Thank you for being such special people. Beach House has been my go to spot on Maui since I first moved in 1999. It has always exceeded expectations I am so grateful that this restaurant was added as one of our stops during our recent trip to Hawaii. We were thrilled when we saw how beautiful it looked from the outside; its interior just adds up to make us even more excited about staying there. Every staff member has been warm and welcoming which helped put me right into that holiday frame of mind. They made sure everything we ordered was freshly prepared each day without sacrificing tastequality or keeping down prices (which can sometimes mean the difference between dining out oncetwice vs three times). This hotel makes ALL guests feel like family members until they leave but also honors them for their business by not making any guest wait for long hours to eatdine-in if someone comes after them. There honestly isn't enough words to describe how much fun we've enjoyed every single visit over the years. Our daughter her fiance recently returned home raving about what a great experience she had while visiting Hawaii; she got to see some new things too...and I'm glad she's feeling comfortable telling everyone about your establishment because I'll bet many will want to come HERE TOGETHER STAY HERE:) The only negative thing to say would be the location itself - it's very hard to find unless you know where you're going. But other than that, we're EXCITED ABOUT THIS PLACE. Gorgeous setting, perfect view of Lahaina Harbor and ocean beyond. They've created an intimate atmosphere that's conducive to conversation and enjoying good company. It's a pleasure to dine among friends or enjoy romantic candlelight dinners with loved ones. Service exceptional, attentive yet informal. Food delicious, cooked al fresco using locally sourced ingredients whenever possible. A rare opportunity to live vicariously through others' photos online expect to share plenty of those yourself....or why not send a gift certificate to someone else?;"

The place has a warm and inviting bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away from the bar area. The menu is varied with plenty of options for appetizers and entrees. The service was attentive and friendly. However, overall the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes and quality of the food."
Eleuther-AI,yelp-467,"Good, but too expensive.... Visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The place has a warm and inviting bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away from the bararea towards some tables in front of windows looking out onto Queen St East (which is actually what they call it). The food was pretty good for this price range... I had an appetizer called ""Chicken Wings"" (5) which were seasoned well with chili paste sauce served over wilted spinach leaves topped off nicely by crispy fries that added another dimension to each bite: sweet salty Yum! Although very filling; not much room left after finishing these morsels:) Satisfying nonetheless! (could have done without those french-fry strips though...) Another favorite dish here would be their Steak 13 - marinated just right prior adding little bits or peppercorn flakes while cooking plus mushrooms sautee before servingjust enough seasoning makes everything taste great together. (obviously can't go wrong when starting your meal like so!) Our server also gave us complimentary ice water at our request nice touch given how hot summer weather we're having now!! Overall experience definitely worth checking into if ever passing through east side Toronto near Eglinton Ave., etc.."

Human,yelp-467,"Good, but too expensive.... Visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The place has a warm and inviting bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away for the bar area. They have a great selections of beers in bottle and on tap. Much to our dismay, the menu selection of beers wasn't what was available on tap - rather disappointing when you are trying to make a meal choice. Service on our night was terribly slow, there was plenty of staff available who only seemed interested in socializing and milling about in a large brood at the back of the Bistro. At a place that specializes in beer, waiting 15 minutes for a drink is ridiculous. One of the many idle server could have easily said, Hey, would you like another? - but they didn't. Lame. The Blue cheese flatiron steak frite was very good, and the Sharp Burger was as well. The desserts we sampled - a waffle with raspberry sauce and an the butter pecan napoleon were excellent...... But here's the rub - Value. Shoddy service aside, 11 beers and 12 hamburgers are a joke. I love Belgian ales and understand they are not cheap, BUT the food and drink are overpriced. 2 Burgers 4 beers w 2 desserts are going to set you back close to 90.00 w tip!! The food and drink are good, but at that price there are LOT's of other dinning options other than a burger and a beer. Solid 3 star place with 2 star value."
Tsinghua,yelp-467,"Good, but too expensive.... Visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The place has a warm and inviting bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away from the bar area. I was seated by the window, and although the place was full, I didn't feel rushed. The food was good, but too expensive. My husband had the Lobster Newburg, which was fantastic. The crab cakes were good, but not as good as I had expected. I had the Chicken Parmesan, which was good, but the price was too high. I would go back again, but I would like to try something different next time. The food is good and reasonable but it's hard to find a nice restaurant that serves the kind of food you want to eat on the price you want to pay. So if you can't find a place that serves the food you want to eat on the price you want to pay, you will probably not find a place that serves good food at a reasonable price.... The Sharp Edge Bistro is a restaurant located in Hampden, Massachusetts at 230 Main Street. This restaurant serves greek salad, curry, and ham hock. They also serve beef stroganoff, fried rice, and steak. The menu has entrees such as shrimp scampi, beef tenderloin, and pork chops. They also serve chowder, pork chops, and fish and chips. For sides, they serve potato salad, mashed potatoes, and fried chicken."
PaLM,yelp-467,"Good, but too expensive.  Visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The place has a warm and inviting bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away from the bar. It was a little crowded for my taste, but it wasn't too bad. The service was good, but the food was a little overpriced. The chicken parmesan was pretty good, but the fries were a little soggy. The steak was cooked perfectly, but it was a little dry. The dessert was good, but it was a little small for the price. Overall, I would say it was a good experience, but it was a little too expensive for what you get. Here is a more detailed review: The Sharp Edge Bistro is a modern American bistro located in the heart of downtown San Francisco. The restaurant features a warm and inviting atmosphere, with exposed brick walls, dim lighting, and comfortable seating. The menu features a variety of American classics, as well as some more creative dishes. The prices are on the high side, but the food is generally good. I visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The restaurant was fairly busy, but we were able to get a table without a wait. The service was excellent, and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. We started our meal with the roasted beet salad, which was served with goat cheese, walnuts, and a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and flavorful, and the goat cheese added a nice touch. For our main course, we ordered the chicken parmesan and the steak frites. The chicken parmesan was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was delicious. The steak frites were also very good, and the fries were perfectly crispy. The only complaint I had was that the steak was a little dry. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse cake. The cake was light and fluffy, and the chocolate sauce was rich and decadent. The only complaint I had was that the cake was a little small for the price. Overall, I had a positive experience at The Sharp Edge Bistro. The food was good, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was inviting. However, the prices are on the high side, so I would only recommend this restaurant to those who are looking for a special dining experience."

I love that they offer small plates that you can share with others. Excellent food and service. Always enjoyable. Delicious food and outstanding service! Our server was knowledgeable and very attentive! She knew the menu inside and out! The server was very personable, helpful and considerate of our conversation. Excellent service and wonderful food. It was our first time at Timpano and we loved it. Our server was great and the food was even better. Excellent food, excellent service and excellent atmosphere.

Tsinghua,yelp-470,"Napoli Pizza location... (765 North Nellis Blvd. North Las Vegas, NV)...is the nastiest place to order food from. The food is under cooked and raw. When you speak to them about the issue they will lie and deny the problem. I have been here twice and have been served raw food both times. This is the worst place I have ever been to. I don't care how much money I spend at a restaurant, it should be good. This is absolutely disgusting! I can't believe they get away with this. I am now going to try to find a way to get a refund for the food I ordered. If you are ever in the North Las Vegas area, don't eat here. Go somewhere else. I think it's funny that this restaurant is open 247, but they can't keep their food warm enough to be served. I was with my husband and daughter. We sat down and ordered our food. I had a salad and my husband had a hot pizza. After 10 minutes my salad was cold and my husband's pizza was still warm. I had to ask for another pizza. I'm not sure how much longer they can go on like this. I had a 9 oz. pizza with mozzarella cheese, a mushroom and sausage. My pizza came out warm but not piping hot. I had to wait 20 minutes for it to get hot. My husband ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza. It was soggy and hard and he complained to the manager.

When you speak to them about it they do not care and are very rude. They will even hang up on you. Be careful in ordering from there. I ordered the sausage and pepperoni and received no sausage. When I called the phone number for the store ), I was told by the person answering the phone, ""You get what you get!"" I asked to speak to the manager, and was put on hold for about 3 minutes. When he finally answered, he told me he was in the middle of making a pizza. I asked him if I could order a pizza, and he said ""No, we're closing."" I asked if I could order one tomorrow, and he said, ""Maybe."" He didn't ask my name, phone number, or address. I asked if he would like to know who I was so he could check the order for the missing sausage, and he said, ""It's your fault."" I told him that I was sure that I had ordered the sausage, and asked if he would be willing to reimburse me for the sausage. He said, ""No, not my problem."" I asked if he would be willing to give me a discount on a future order, and he said, ""No, not my problem."" I asked if he would be willing to give me a free pizza, and he said, ""No, not my problem."" I asked him if he would be willing to give me anything to compensate me for the missing sausage, and he said, ""No, not my problem."" I asked if he would be willing to give me a dollar, and he said, ""No, not my problem."" This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life. I will never order from Napoli Pizza again, and I will recommend that no one else does either. I have been going to Napoli pizza for a long time and have always received good service and good food. However, the last time I went into the store on Nellis, the young woman at the counter was very rude and seemed to be a very bad representation of this establishment. She was on the phone when I entered and I got to the counter and I waited and waited. She was talking so loud I could hear everything she said. It was very personal and not a business call at all. She finally got off the phone and I ordered my pizza. She gave me my total, I gave her my money and she started to give me my change and then slammed her hand down on the counter and said it was the correct change. I told her I had never been treated like that before. I was very taken back by her attitude. She has very bad customer service skills and should not be allowed to work with the public. I will be back in town in a couple of weeks and will try to go back to see if she is still working there. I will never go to this store again if she is working there. I have been going there for years and she has never been there before. I want to thank you for taking my complaint and I hope this employee will be spoken to about her attitude. Today I went to the Napoli Pizza on Rainbow and Warm Springs. I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni. After about 20 minutes, they told me it was ready. I went to pick it up and paid 23. 50. When I got home, I opened the box and there was no pepperoni on the pizza. I called the store and asked if I could bring it back and they told me that they had made a mistake. I was unable to take it back. I called the store several times and could not get anyone to answer the phone. I will not go back to this store again. I have gone to this store for many years and have always received good service and good food. This was a very disappointing experience. I received a pizza for delivery and paid with a credit card. The driver didn't bring a receipt with him, so I went to the store to get one. I was told that it was in the computer. I had to call the store to get a copy of the receipt. I called the store and they were not very cooperative. They finally faxed a copy to me. I went to pick it up at the store and there was no one there to take care of me. I went to the counter and there was an employee back there but she would not come up front to help me. Finally after a long wait she came up. She"

So I pulled around to the window and she was like here you go. And handed me another 5. I didn't want to take it but I didn't want to be rude so I just said thank you.

Here's our take on what makes Charleston one of America's best-loved cities: fine restaurants, charming homes with lovely gardens overlooking a waterfront or harbor view, beautiful churches steeped in history but not too old-fashioned, amazing beaches backed by historic mountains, art galleries like no other - it's all here. And it isn't just about tourists; the locals love their city as much as you do! When you're ready to plan your visit, consider booking accommodations through Trip Advisor so that you can read traveler reviews before making reservations at preferred hotels.

Here are three fun ways to explore more of this year's highlights... It's been nearly two years since many people were forced indoors due to COVID-19, yet now things look a lot different than they did then. With vaccinations rolling out worldwide, life has gradually started returning back to normality...and soon enough, perhaps even sooner, air travel might finally resume its former glory. Despite challenges posed by global events such as the pandemic, 2020 saw record-breaking numbers of international arrivals across Aotearoa New Zealand. So far in 2021, February's tally looks very promising indeed, especially considering recent closures caused by heavy snowfalls elsewhere in Europe. Thanks to more frequent flights, less costly tickets and increased availability of hotel rooms compared to last spring, these holidays may prove extremely affordable once again next year. Plus, unlike past times when everything had to happen fast, now plenty of time can be spent planning ahead. Traveling during the winter months offers the perfect opportunity to escape scorching heat while still enjoying exciting activities outside of your usual comfort zone. From sledding down forest trails to skiing uphill slopes, New Zealand currently possesses some pretty impressive natural terrain accessible only by foot, bike, horseback riding, motorcycle or 4WD vehicle. Whether you're heading abroad for leisurely escapes, romantic getaways or family-friendly adventures, there are endless opportunities available right here in Auckland.

Human,yelp-475,"Meh pretty much sums it up in an as not-snobby way as possible, though it's Yelp and meh reviews of triple cash money places ALWAYS sound snobby, so.... well.... shit. This restaurant is ENORMOUS and thus is pretty cavernous on a weekday night at 9pm, which is when we went. As a two-top we were made to wait for 20 minutes at the bar for a lounge table even though the lounge area was only half full and the table at which we were eventually seated was open when we walked in. Meh. We ordered the omakase (125 bones for the Chef's Selection version - there's a longer tasting menu for 175). The first four courses were all sashimi salads. In order: tuna with yuzu soy sauce, seared salmon belly with miso crumble and yuzu soy sauce, hamachi with cilantro, jalapeno and yuzu citrus glaze, sea bass with miso, crispy garlic and yuzu olive oil. ALL YUZU EVERYTHING. The fish was very high quality, but by the fourth course I think my citrus taste buds had punched in their overtime and gone home. Meh. A waiter then brought us a fine-looking plate of tuna sashimi, which our server had to unceremoniously repossess a few minutes later, as it was not part of the omakase and delivered by mistake. We were told that a sushi plate was to follow later. Meh. The fifth and sixth courses were the Nobu signature miso-glazed sea bass with grilled asparagus, which was excellent, and a definitely not-medium-rare steak teppanyaki with enoki mushrooms, which was just okay - meh if you will. The seventh course was puzzling, a bowl of jalapeno-mayonnaise glazed rock shrimp that appeared like an appetizer pulling up fashionably late to the meal progression. We didn't finish it. The promised sushi plate arrived as the eighth course, in the form of spicy tuna rolls. MEEEHHH. Fortunately the dessert was great. Flourless molten chocolate cake, fresh fruit and four flavors of mochi ice cream. It was uniformly awesome. 250 for dinner for two before tax, tip and drinks is not outlandish in Vegas but no one could or should call you snobby for expecting more out of a restaurant that looks this impressive and bears the Nobu brand name. meh"

The food is fine. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It's just.... fine. The service is good. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they do a good job of making sure you have everything you need. The atmosphere is nice. It's a bit on the pretentious side, but it's still a nice place to have a meal. Overall, it's a fine restaurant. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. If you're looking for a place to eat that's not too expensive and not too pretentious, then this is a good option. But if you're looking for something really special, then you're better off going somewhere else. Here are some specific examples of what I mean:  The food was just okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The dishes were all pretty standard, and nothing really stood out.  The service was good. The staff was friendly and attentive, and they did a good job of making sure we had everything we needed. They were also very knowledgeable about the menu and were able to make recommendations.  The atmosphere was nice. The restaurant was decorated in a modern style, and the lighting was dim and romantic. The music was also very nice and set the mood perfectly. Overall, I had a positive experience at this restaurant. The food was good, the service was great, and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good place to eat. Here are some other things to keep in mind:  The restaurant is a bit on the expensive side. The average entree costs around $25, and the cocktails are even more expensive.  The restaurant is also a bit on the pretentious side. The staff is very formal, and the atmosphere is very elegant.  The restaurant is not very kid-friendly. There is no kids' menu, and the noise level can be quite high. Overall, this restaurant is a good option for adults who are looking for a nice place to eat. The food is good, the service is great, and the atmosphere is nice. However, the restaurant is a bit on the expensive side and is not very kid-friendly."

The food was alright, but nothing to rave about. It was food. I'm not going to say it was bad, but it wasn't good either. I think I'd rather just do takeout or delivery from my favorite places around the city than actually go out to eat at this place. I will say that my Bloody Mary was pretty tasty, but still, not enough to save this place. Labels: sigh, Bloody Mary, brunch, delivery, diner, eggs, french fries, takeout, yelp Have you seen the movie ""The Butler""? If you haven't, go watch it now, and then come back and read this. Still here? Okay, cool. After seeing this movie, I was compelled to read ""The Butler"" (the book that the movie is based on). I don't usually read biographies, but when I do, they're usually about a really awesome person or a family that has done something really awesome, like started a successful business, or fought a lot of civil rights battles, or invented something really awesome, or discovered something, or something of that nature. As you probably know, ""The Butler"" is the story of the life of a man named Eugene Allen, who worked in the White House for 34 years, serving seven Presidents, and his wife, Helene. It's a really awesome book. Eugene is just a regular man, but he's also not a regular man. He's a regular man in that he was an African-American man during the civil rights era, who got a job working in the White House. But at the same time, he's not a regular man because his job gave him access to a world that most African-American people weren't given access to during his time, and it enabled him to provide a better life for his family than what he had experienced growing up. One of the things that really stood out to me was how Eugene was able to make something of himself in this world, despite the odds that were against him. He worked hard, and he persevered and he took advantage of opportunities that were presented to him. He didn't just sit around and bitch and moan about how unfair it was that black people had to use separate restrooms than white people, he did something about it. He wasn't alone in doing something about it. In fact, there were a lot of people who also took action and did something about it. It just so happens that Eugene's story was published in a book. That doesn't mean that other people didn't work just as hard as he did, or even harder, but they just didn't happen to get a book deal. For instance, I have a friend who is a black woman. She and her husband have three children. They're all really awesome people. They all have jobs. Her oldest daughter is a single mom of a little boy, and she just got promoted at her job. Her son is a straight-A student and is going to college on a scholarship. Her youngest daughter, who is a year younger than me, just got married. She has a good job. Her husband has a good job. Her husband's mother and step-father have good jobs. They all work for the government. They're just regular people, but they're also not regular people. They're regular people in that they live in the suburbs of DC, they all work, and they all have good jobs. But at the same time, they're not regular people because they're black, and they're successful. They're not poor. They're not on welfare. They're not criminals. They're just normal, every day people, and that's awesome. There are a lot of people who are just like my friend's family. They're not rich, they're not famous, and they probably won't be the subject of a book, or a movie. But they're awesome people who are living their lives and making the best of what they have. So why do some people have to go around spreading lies that everyone who is black is poor, or on welfare, or a criminal? Or that everyone who is poor is black? Or that everyone who is on welfare is black? Or that everyone who is a criminal is black? It's a shitty thing to do. Labels"

So....here's the thing.. I'm a little nervous about moving, and I have to say...I really like my job. I love the people I work with, and the work I do. It's a 10-20 minute drive to work. It's a big company, so I know I'll be okay..but the location is pretty crappy. So I have a couple of questions... 1. Is it safe to leave a lot of my stuff in the apartment, or should I take everything out? 2. Is there anything I can do to make it more appealing? 3. How long do I have to make my move-out date? I've had this place for 6 months, and I'm just wondering how long I have to make the move-out date? I have a lot of stuff, and don't know how much to take, or how much to leave behind. 4.

Thanks, Mollie That's a lot of questions. I have a feeling your moving and that's why you're asking so many questions. As for the first question, I wouldn't leave much in the apartment. If you leave things behind it's going to make it difficult to move out and you may not get them back. That being said, if you have a safe deposit box or somewhere to store things you don't want to take with you you can do that."

PaLM,yelp-476,"Ok, so I have lived here for almost a year now, and am not renewing my lease. For what I pay here, I could get a nice house or town-home in the suburbs. I think it’s time for a change. I’ve been looking at houses online for a few weeks now, and I’ve found a few that I really like. One is a small ranch house in a quiet neighborhood. It’s close to schools and shopping, and it has a big backyard for my dog. The other is a townhouse in a more urban area. It’s close to public transportation and has a rooftop deck with amazing views of the city. I’m not sure which one I want to get yet, but I’m excited to start this new chapter in my life. I’ve been living in apartments for the past few years, and I’m ready to have my own space. I’m also looking forward to having a yard and being able to have pets. I know that moving is a lot of work, but I’m up for the challenge. I’m already starting to pack up my things, and I’m looking forward to getting settled into my new place. I’m also excited to meet my new neighbors and explore my new neighborhood. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I’m excited to find out. I’m ready to start this new chapter in my life, and I can’t wait to see what it brings. Here are some of the benefits of moving to the suburbs:  Lower cost of living. The cost of living in the suburbs is typically lower than in the city. This is because there are fewer amenities and services available in the suburbs, which means that you can save money on things like rent, food, and transportation.  More space. Homes in the suburbs are typically larger than homes in the city. This means that you have more space to spread out and relax. You also have more room for outdoor activities, such as gardening, grilling, and playing with your kids.  Better schools. The schools in the suburbs are typically better than the schools in the city. This is because the suburbs have more resources and funding available for their schools.  Safer neighborhoods. The suburbs are typically safer than the city. This is because there is less crime and violence in the suburbs. Here are some of the drawbacks of moving to the suburbs:  Longer commutes. The suburbs are typically further away from jobs and businesses than the city. This means that you may have a longer commute to work or school.  Less access to amenities. The suburbs have fewer amenities and services available than the city. This means that you may have to travel further to get to things like restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues.  Less diversity. The suburbs are typically less diverse than the city. This means that you may not have as much exposure to different cultures and people. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to move to the suburbs is a personal one. You need to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of living in the suburbs and decide what is best for you."

Upon moving in...I was told my Apartment was going to be a 3 bedroom on the third floor with new carpet...and paint...well when it came time to move in the apartment I was suppose to get was not ready, I had no choice because I had already vacated my last place...so they put me in another apartment, with stained carpet, shitty paint and tile and it still had furniture in it from the last tenant...and stuff in the drawers and cabinets...it had not even been cleaned and it was on the 2nd floor. How much is the average electric bill I asked...they said no more then 200 in summer...mine has been closer to 300...nearly twice as much as what I was paying before I moved here for the same size unit. I asked how sound proof are the walls, am I going to be able to hear my neighbors...I live on the middle floor. They said I wouldn't it is a quiet complex, LIE...first night the people above me sounded like they were having a zumba class. If you fart to loud your neighbors will probably complain...and the office will give you a ten day notice for farting to loud. They failed to mention that the pet rent was a monthly charge not a one time fee. And this place is definitely not pet friendly, if you own a dog, and if that dog barks, don't live here...they will try to evict you every week for that one. You will get notices for everything. They also did not explain that I would have to pay for water every month, which took them three months just to mail it to me. So your rent changes every month...it is never the same amount. Um...you pay the landlord the water bill not the water company...sound fishy! This place sucks on all levels, the pictures do not do it justice, the apartments are old, the kitchen cabinets are 1990's, the fountain and grass are all gone, filled in with rocks and dirt. They landscaping sucks. Pool is ghetto, You can only get sun before 4pm otherwise it is blocked out by the buildings. And it is small, it is usually hoarded by fat people and screaming kids. And if anything breaks...it will take maintenance months to fix...because they never show up on time. The management office is a joke, no one is there to help you, they look at you like your a problem, I live in the biggest apartment they have and pay the most rent and pay on time...you think they would try to take care of a tenant like me...instead I get harassed.

We can't afford to sell right now as well due again being underwater but at least if i'm able too take out some equity from this one..we wont really need any money after covering closing costs etc I've seen so many properties around me go up by thousands over night when they're vacant owners leave of course there's no guarantee you'll see anything like those numbers with how much these people paid originally....but its better than nothing!

We live in Westchester County NY, which is 2 hours from Manhattan. If you can afford it though please don't let me discourage anyone who wants to go home:] You won't be able to go anywhere as easily without your job if you leave Amherst Cambridge - there isn't much left of any industry around there now except some medical services pharmaceuticals. Yes, we also live close to Boston! We went there once with our nephew who would like to do medicine at Harvard Medical School! What sort of salary? How many kids? Do people stay very long? What kind of budget do you guys have? Most parents still need their children until they're 18 years old so you'd probably find yourself working a lot longer than most other Americans. When you're young they only really care how richpoor someone is and whether they can buy things or not; by then you're more concerned with education and quality of life issues. I'm hoping that's true because I'd love to raise 3 kids myself (but haven't been blessed enough yet)!

Eleuther-AI,yelp-477,"This place just plain sucks! After getting turned down at SW for not having a reservation, we strolled into this horrible excuse of a fine dining restaurant. The menu looked promising but the food was awful and there were no hot items to be had (even after being told that our entrees would take 45 minutes). We ordered two dishes off their regular dinner lunch menus: 1) filet mignon with bearnaise sauce which tasted as though it came from some old boxed freezer meat instead on good fresh cut beef; 2.) Andouille sausage topped w mushroom risotto in an attempt by them trying too hard...it seemed like they took something out back behind my house one day without permission while I wasn't watching then tried slapping together whatever leftovers remained next time somebody swung around past whenever nobody's looking so if anyone could smell raw sewage you have yourself..."
LLAMA,yelp-477,"This place just plain sucks! After getting turned down at SW for not having a reservation, we strolled into this horrible excuse of a fine dining restaurant. The menu looked impressive but don't let that fool you. This place is a dump. The food was mediocre at best and the service was pathetic. I was stunned to see so many people in there for the price of the meal. The food was way overpriced for the quality of what we received. I wouldn't give this place a second chance. I'll take the drive to St. Augustine and pay the 10 to park to have a great meal. My advice is to keep going past this dump and go to Mimi's Cafe or even Applebee's. Posted by Walter on 09012005 at 4:53 PM Re: ""Famous Amos"" Hey, I was wondering if there was any other reviews. I actually thought the food was very good, but a bit overpriced. The servers were very attentive, and it was nice to have a change of pace. Posted by James on 06012005 at 9:53 AM"
Human,yelp-477,"This place just plain sucks! After getting turned down at SW for not having a reservation, we strolled into this horrible excuse of a fine dining restaurant. The menu looked so appetizing, however the food was terrible. Two of us ordered the lobster risotto, one ordered the pasta with prawns a scampi sauce and the other ordered the short rib pasta. The lobster risotto sounded so promising. What a disappointment! It was terrible. We kept joking around that they pulled out a box of broccoli cheese rice-a-roni and threw in a tiny piece of lobster to spruce it up a bit. Both pastas were so mediocre. Olive Garden has better food than this. All of these dishes were around 35. Originally planning on going to SW, we knew we would be paying out of our noses for dinner, so paying 35 for pasta wasn't that big of a deal. However, 35 for crappy, half-ass food is a crime. If you ever come across this place, turn around and run as fast as you can. What a waste of money and what could have been a great Vegas dining experience."

The menu looked nice, but it was missing any of the ingredients that we liked, so we had to go back to SW.

Granted, we only spent about 45 minutes there, but I can't imagine what it would be like to sit and have a nice meal for an hour and a half. They should be ashamed of themselves. The food wasn't bad, but it was definitely a sub-par restaurant. If you're a fan of the blues, then I suppose you might enjoy this place, but I wouldn't suggest it.

The menu looked uninspiring and the ambiance was lackluster. We were just about ready to leave when the waiter came to take our order. I am sorry to hear that you had a negative experience at the restaurant. It can be disappointing when your expectations are not met, especially when it comes to fine dining. However, it is important to remember that every restaurant has its own unique style and offerings, and what may not appeal to one person may be enjoyable for another. If you are still looking for a place to dine, I would be happy to help you find a restaurant that fits your preferences and expectations."

Love the pools, the vast array of cardio equipment and layout. So what went wrong? I'm so bummed because the gym experience was ruined for me. Within 10 minutes of being on the treadmill, I had three different women stop me and ask me if I had ""been in a car accident"" and that I had ""a good plastic surgeon."" As a regular member, I have only seen two other men at the gym. I've stopped going because I'm too embarrassed. I'm so bummed because I thought I'd finally found my gym home.

So many classes to choose from if they fit in your schedule and the kids area is great, they even have kids cardio classes! However now that summer break is here there are too many kids everywhere during the day after 12, in the mornings it's not as bad. The place is clean and the trainers clean the equipment daily. The locker room is constantly being cleaned and I like the family locker room idea too. The cafe is ok.... Healthy options but high calorie and carb, no egg white options, fresh veggie juices, or such that I see. List nice to have a gym that recognizes families and has movie nights at the pool, and pool day events."

So many options for so many workouts. They have a great juice bar with a juice of the day. I get mine with kale, chard and spinach and I always get a glass of wine with it! They also have great salads and sandwiches and some breakfast items. The trainers are very helpful and knowledgeable. There are trainers in the gym 247 so if you want a trainer just ask for them. They are friendly and knowledgeable. My trainer is wonderful! I am a beginner but my trainer always makes sure I am doing the right moves. The only downfall is that they have a lot of machines and some of them are broken. Also I feel that they are overbooking the classes and the line up can be a little long. But other than that this gym is a great value! The Gym is expensive and has a lot of equipment that is outdated. The classes are pricey as well.

I'm very satisfied with my trainer and all of the other trainers that are in the gym. The fitness classes are always varied and fun.

So I’ve been going to this gym for about a year now and I’ve been really happy with it. It’s a little pricey, but the facilities are top notch and it’s very convenient for me. I love the pools, which are both indoor and outdoor. The indoor pool is heated, so it’s perfect for swimming laps even in the winter. The outdoor pool is great for relaxing and sunbathing. The gym has a huge selection of cardio equipment, including treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and stair climbers. There are also a few weight machines, but not as many as I would like. I really like the layout of the gym. It’s divided into different areas, so it’s easy to find what you’re looking for. There’s also a big locker room with plenty of showers and lockers. Overall, I’m really happy with this gym. It’s a great place to work out and I’ve seen some great results since I started going. 5 stars!"

I will definitely be returning for another week or two soon! Thank you so much for your feedback regarding our resort team. We appreciate all our guests taking time to give us their honest opinions about our services. For those who have been there before - do you recommend staying over one night? Or would a 2 day stay still suffice? I personally think that three days should work fine if you're planning on doing several activities during each day. Although we can go longer without feeling like we're missing anything. Our friendly front desk staff has more information re: excursions available here than anywhere else... Anyway this place is great!! As someone mentioned above they make sure you know exactly what to expect when arriving. You don't get taken by surprise with any surprises!!!"
PaLM,yelp-479,Went to get a sandwich the one I wanted was already pre made. I don't eat turkey only wanted ham they said make your own. So I did and instead I got a half and half sandwich. I didn't want to waste the ham so I ate the whole thing. But I was still upset that I couldn't get the sandwich I wanted.

Tsinghua,yelp-479,"Went to get a sandwich the one I wanted was already pre made. I don't eat turkey only wanted ham they said make your own. So I did and instead of my choice of ham they gave me ham and turkey sandwich and my daughter wanted to eat one too so I put it on her sandwich. The kids didn't even know. They were shocked to find out that we had ham and turkey sandwich for our meal. But what really surprised me is the fact that the manager said that it was okay. He told us that we were only allowed to order one meal so it was okay. I'm just amazed at this one. They should be fined and the manager should be fired. He was totally wrong and he just turned a blind eye to it. He should have known better. I am very disappointed in this restaurant. I have to give it one star. If you can't be responsible for your employees and their actions then you shouldn't be open. I think that you should look into it and make sure that it never happens again. Thank you for your time. So disappointed in this restaurant. I went there for the first time last night with my boyfriend and we both ordered the buffet and got a different food then we were told we would get. The staff there were very rude to us and were trying to push us to buy drinks and other food items we were not even told about. When we were leaving, one of the employees started following us to see if we left with any food. This was the first time I had ever experienced anything like this and I am very disappointed in this place. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I really liked this place when we first went there. The only problem we had was that the food wasn't fresh. The ham was almost all moldy. The chicken was too dry. We had to send out all the food and had to pay for the food we didn't eat. The manager did not seem to care about us having to pay for the food. The food wasn't good at all. I would never go back there again. I was very disappointed with this restaurant. The manager seemed very rude and didn't seem to care that we had to pay for the food we didn't eat.

So I did and instead of tortillas put it in my container with plastic wrap around top which melted all over not going back for another even though there were still some left since am diabetic now have diabetes 3 months ago so had no choice but just paid full price anyway It's 40 each way without insurance or coupons because we live too far from work!
LLAMA,yelp-479,"Went to get a sandwich the one I wanted was already pre made. I don't eat turkey only wanted ham they said make your own. So I did and instead of getting onion on my sandwich they gave me tomatoes that I didn't ask for so I asked for it to be remade. I said I wanted onion not tomato and I ended up with both. I asked the manager to please remake it because I didn't ask for tomato she said no. I was just there to get a sandwich. Not to be treated like I was just another customer. The only way to get good service is to be a regular. I love subway. My favorite sandwich is the veggie delight. I've never had any problems and the staff is very nice. I've been ordering for delivery online, and the last couple of times I've ordered, it has come without cheese. Even though I ordered a cheese sub. I love Subway! Their food is so good. This one is really nice and clean, and the service is always quick and friendly. This place is awesome! They have the best quality food and the nicest employees. I love this place!"

Human,yelp-480,"We arrived at the restaurant during early evening on a Thursday. There were only two other customers at the time sitting at a corner table. The female at that table was having an extrememly loud cell phone conversation that we were not interested in. We stood at the entrance for a minute. No one greeted us. Two Asian males were just sitting at the bar chatting, not paying attention to us. One had an apron on with the nametag BAI. The other one just read a newspaper at the bar. So I began to walk over and get a menu from the shelf at the rear of the the two males. I was interested in some spicy Szechuan cuisine. The other two in my party wanted something not so spicy. The female in our group asked if everything was spicy. Bai finally interupted us and stated with a sarcastic glare, the one with the chili (icon) is hot! We agreed to eat here and told Bai that there were three of us dining. Bai immediately attempted to sit us at a small table adjacent to the the loud lady on the cell phone. I gestured to the larger table and Bai asked, how many? We said, Three. Bai gestured us away from the larger round table, towards the smaller table adjacent to the loud female on the cell phone again. Bai stated,you have three, three sit here! There were maybe 30-40 EMPTY tables in the entire restaurant and he refused to have us sit anywhere but near the loud lady. We finally told him that we would like the larger table to make room for the many dishes we were going to try. Bai became disgruntled and we sat at the larger table. As we were looking at the menu items, I noticed that Bai had walked towards the bar and muttered something to his Asian friend reading the newspaper. Bai then turned around and glared at us. I finally had had it and decided that a sour attitude would probably be present during the entire meal. I wish I had read the YELPS on this restaurant prior to considering it. I stood up and stated to my friends that it would be of best interest if we departed now since we felt uncomfortable by the ungracious staff. I should have also noticed that no one was breaking the door down attempting to dine in this awful place. All three of us are Asian, so I don't think there was any unpleasantries due to race. We ended up next door at the Capitol Seafood Restaurant where we were pleasantly greeted and respected during the entire meal. We were even given free desserts, which no one else received that we noticed. We should have waved a 100 bill at Bai as we passed leaving the area, because that is what he lost his restaurant that evening, not to mention this AWESOME review."

The female at that table wore a black veil, while the male wore a black jacket and red tie, a look that was eerily similar to that of the waiter who had welcomed us at the door. We were seated at a table near the back of the restaurant and were offered the menu. The restaurant had been featured in a few articles, and we had known what we wanted to order beforehand. The atmosphere was calm and relaxed, and we were able to hear the conversations of the other customers. We ordered the black raspberry ice cream for dessert, a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dark red fruit sauce on top. The flavour was subtle but not too strong, and the ice cream was perfectly creamy. We ordered the pork belly appetizer, served with two small slices of brioche bread. The meat had a crispy outer layer of skin, and the meat was tender and flavourful. It was accompanied by a small scoop of red cabbage slaw. For the main course, we ordered the duck confit. It was a large serving, with a generous portion of duck meat, sauteed vegetables, and a side of potatoes. The duck was very tender and the skin was crispy, just like the pork belly. The meal was quite salty, but the overall flavour was good."

As we were walking out the door, the female at the corner table smiled at us and said, ""Have a nice day."" We smiled back and said, ""You too."" We walked down the street for a few blocks and then turned onto a side street. As we were walking, we saw a man standing in the shadows. He was wearing a black hoodie and jeans and had a backpack on his back. He looked at us and then turned and walked away. We continued walking and then turned onto another side street. As we were walking, we saw a woman standing in front of a building. She was wearing a long black coat and a black hat. She had a scarf covering her face and she was holding a sign that said, ""Will work for food."" We stopped and looked at her for a moment and then we continued walking. We walked for a few more blocks and then we turned onto a main street. We walked for a few more blocks and then we arrived at our hotel. We checked into our hotel room and then we went out to get something to eat. We found a restaurant that was close to our hotel and we had dinner. After dinner, we went back to our hotel room and went to bed. The next morning, we woke up and had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. After breakfast, we checked out of our hotel and then we went to the airport. We got on our plane and flew back home. We had a great time on our trip and we are already planning our next one."
BigScience,yelp-480,"We arrived at the restaurant during early evening on a Thursday. There were only two other customers at the time sitting at a corner table. The female at that table was reading her book while she waited for me to come out from behind my sushi box, so I could place our order."
BigScience,yelp-481,"Ok this was my third try and the last. The first two times I went for pho at lunch. Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me there's a difference between people who work in restaurants, those who have been trained by them, or even students). This time it was great - quick, efficient, polite. Again it tasted good though. This place has become so popular that it became impossible to get food without waiting 20 minutes for a table"
Tsinghua,yelp-481,"Ok this was my third try and the last. The first two times I went for pho at lunch. Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me that I should be ""informed"" when the bill is presented, the whole ""how much would you like to pay?"" is a ridiculous concept.). The first time I went I ordered the pho bo bo, it came out a half hour later, the soup was cold and the beef was overcooked. The second time I ordered the pho bo bo again, I was told the pho was on its way. I had to wait another 15 minutes. The soup was still cold, the beef was still overcooked. The last time I ordered the pho bo bo, it was delivered after another 15 minutes. I ordered it a 12 hour after I had ordered lunch. The soup was cold, the beef was overcooked. They only take cash, no cards. That's a deal breaker. I will not return, at least not for lunch. Tried it out for lunch. When we arrived, there was a huge line out the door. We waited about 30 minutes for our table. The food was pretty good. We were very disappointed with the service. Our waiter was constantly talking on the phone and not paying attention to us. We ordered a bottle of wine, and when we came to the table, we had no wine, but he did not even tell us that we didn't have wine. We had to ask him about it. We were seated at a corner table. Our waiter was walking around the entire restaurant every 15 minutes or so. It was very difficult to get attention. It was a very busy lunch hour, but it seemed that no one could get attention.

LLAMA,yelp-481,"Ok this was my third try and the last. The first two times I went for pho at lunch. Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me that serving a bowl of pho requires more than a minute and a half). They didn't even acknowledge my presence so I left and decided to go for another pho place. I know you're thinking, that's two strikes, what was I doing back here? Well my wife had a hankering for pho and I'm a nice guy. We arrived just after 6:00 pm and it was already crowded. I was somewhat mollified by the crowd as perhaps they were busy, but again they didn't acknowledge my presence as I stood at the counter. I had to actually ask if I could be seated (which they finally did). As we sat at the table I looked around and saw that everyone was Asian and also that everyone had been served. Again I was the only white guy in the restaurant. Maybe that has something to do with my being ignored but I'm not going to take a poll to find out. Food: I ordered the same thing I ordered previously, pho with brisket and flank steak. The brisket was good as was the steak. The soup had plenty of noodles but didn't have a great flavor. I added lots of hoisin and hot sauce to give it some flavor. Service: As I mentioned, abysmal. It took a full 20 minutes for us to get our soup. Atmosphere: The place is your typical small strip mall Asian restaurant. It is clean and brightly lit. Nothing particularly special about the place. Bottom Line: I can't really recommend this place for pho. They have other Vietnamese dishes on the menu and they may be good.

Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me that a restaurant in Chinatown can't do better than their soggy noodles.) The second time, it took over an hour before our food arrived but we were also told by other customers they waited longer as well so maybe i really am unlucky when choosing restaurants there I'm not sure if your experience will be any different since you're more likely able find places with decent reviews or yelp... (Side note: why are chinese people always surprised about how long american take on average waiting tables? It's normal!)"

Human,yelp-481,"Ok this was my third try and the last. The first two times I went for pho at lunch. Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me I should have to wait 20 min for pho) and my pho ga was MEH (I believe that was beef broth in my ga-LAZY). This time I got crispy rolls and BBQ pork vermicelli and the service was markedly improved. The crispy rolls were the best I have ever had and I loved the fresh fixings that came with them. I love spicy food but found it odd that their fish sauce is spicy. I've eaten at lots of Vietnamese places in silicon valley and the fish sauce was always sweet. The pork was severely overcooked. Most pieces were the consistency of jerky; some were so hard I couldn't tear them in half with my fingers. If this is authentic Vietnamese, I'll take the Americanized version where my fish sauce is sweet and the meats are tender and juicy, thank you very much!"
PaLM,yelp-481,"Ok this was my third try and the last. The first two times I went for pho at lunch. Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me that it is acceptable for a server to get your order wrong then bring you the wrong thing three times in a row, and then when you finally get what you ordered, it is cold and the broth has been watered down, but no they don't care enough to remake it for you). And the third time I went for dinner and it was only marginally better. The service was still bad, but the food was at least hot. But that doesn't make up for the fact that the food is just not that good. Pho is ok, but it is not even close to the best pho I have had in the city. And the other dishes on the menu are just not very good. So overall, this is a place to avoid."

BigScience,yelp-482,"One word that describes Thai Spices is meh. Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space. When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor. Everything looks like a homey greenhouse we see around Bangkok. The entrance to this restaurant reminded us of our favorite cafe called Blue Hill. The menu for Miang Thai includes dishes such as Tom Yum Noodles with pig's blood sauce (150), Kareem Krappa Eggplant Salad (170), and Baked Prawns on Rice Paper (190). We were quite surprised when they didn't add any chicken or beef option among their many vegetarian items. If you are planning your next Thailand vacation, this one must be added to your list! If you're looking for authentic Thai food but don't want to travel all the way to Chiang Mai, then Miu Cafe might just fit the bill! This small cafe located at the top floor of MBK has been serving up delicious Asian fusion cuisine since 2008. Their signature dish is the Chicken Dashi Soup which comes served hot from saucepan onto plates along side garnishes. Not only does it taste great but they're also very generous with servings. I love how affordable everything was here too - starters are priced between 30 and 40 while mains cost about 70 per head. Pick up some of these yummy treats to have after exploring Bangkok city center or shopping in Siam Paragon Mall: Midas Restaurant is another place worth checking out if you're craving good French cuisines in Bangkok. Starting off humble back in 1986, the restaurant quickly rose through the ranks by offering an extensive selection of seafood and steak options. Aside from seafood, Midas offers other mouth-watering delicacies including Phuket Po Nam Style Fried Seafood (300) and Beef Croquettes (180). This spot opened earlier than expected so keep your eyes peeled on the website whenever traveling there because it's always crowded during lunch time. You can grab any item on their buffet menu without spending much money. For example, the Nasi Lemak Special (250) costs less than 10 baht each meal giving you enough noodle to fill up for three people plus various dessert options ranging from 90 - 200."
LLAMA,yelp-482,"One word that describes Thai Spices is meh. Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space. When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor. However, it's very small and gets loud. I'm not sure if the owners are the same, but the food is totally different. I used to like BoCa 7 and am disappointed that it's gone. We started off with some appetizers. We had a Spicy Grilled Beef Salad that was simply okay. It didn't have a lot of flavor and the meat was tough. The flavors didn't come together. Their Thai Spring Rolls were decent. They were made with crab, pork and shrimp and came with a peanut sauce. For my entree, I had the Pad Kra Pao. This dish consisted of a stir fry with meat, basil leaves, garlic and chili. It was served on top of a bed of rice. The chicken was tender and the dish was okay. It's a bit spicy and really needs to have more flavor to it. Their Spicy Lemon Grass Chicken was okay. The dish had a strong lemongrass flavor but needed more spiciness to it. The chicken was tender and cooked well. - If you want to get a taste of Thailand, don't go here. - They need to work on their flavors. The food is bland and needs to be improved. - Their prices are a bit expensive for the food."
Human,yelp-482,"One word that describes Thai Spices is meh. Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space. When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor. alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi). The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday. Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere. Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers. The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related. The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings. Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence. After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there. The thai dishes were not very good. We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small. Also the green curry was salty, I have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking. But it was good though, good with rice that is. Also even though we got it mild it still had a healthy kick of spices. The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side. The Tom Yum soup was good. Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off. Again this was a lil on the salty side too. The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab. That has a unique after taste. So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you. But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there. Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity."

The chips are crunchy tasted very fresh...the pickle relish is ok, nothing special... the corn bread had nice fluffiness on top.. but the rest of the sandwich pieces were too dry... Afternoon tea at the Hilton hotel in Muscat yesterday was another aquarium experience! There wasn't any live animals there as usual though it included some fish which always amuses me! I started off by ordering my standard afternoon tea with scones, homemade jam, fruit salad, clotted cream orange juice. This time I went for their signature mussels served with lemon butter sauce. This time all they have on offer is mussels only however if you go back again there's also prawns available for an extra charge of 5 AED per plate. I did like how they put these into little cups before serving them so that we could dip our fingers in it. Then came my main course. They serve two types of shrimps: black tiger shrimp or white tiger shrimp. If you're lucky enough you can get both flavours together in one dish although it's probably more expensive than biting into each separately."

I am guessing they are dipped in chickpea flour batter. The cornbread was warm and went well with the gravy.The gravy here is a nice peppery kind with the right amount of thickness and consistency.

Good news is that I got my food within 30 mins. For the price of 15 I think it's worth the wait! 2. Mr Mo - Smooth Relaxing Service The gentleman at the counter gave me a soft and friendly welcome and served me with a smile. They've got a big selection of juices, smoothies, and drinks to choose from. I chose the mango smoothie with a small apple slice and I found it to be quite refreshing! The service was quick and efficient. 3. Barbecue Cafe - Good Value For Money Barbecue Cafe is located at The Food Village. They offer a range of cuisines and we ordered 3 different dishes. The chicken wings (13.90), burgers (14.90) and a platter of sandwiches (15.90). We shared a platter of sandwiches and we all had our favourites - chicken wings, chicken tenders and a mushroom burger. We ordered fries to go with our meals and we found the fries to be very good quality. The service was good and we were served within 15 minutes of ordering. Barbecue Cafe also offers takeaway and delivery service. 4. Soulfood - Hot, Fast Spicy We ordered 3 dishes from Soulfood and they are the Spicy Beef Sandwich, Chicken Curry and Spicy Lamb Burger. The chicken curry and the spicy lamb burger were both delicious. We were not disappointed! The sandwich was hot, fresh and the spice blend was just right. The Spicy Beef Sandwich was also good but I think it could have been better if the meat was a bit more tender. 5. Boxed Pizza - Good Value For Money Boxed Pizza is a 3D food concept where you can choose your pizzas, chips, drinks and sides to go and have them delivered to your doorstep. You can choose from 10 different pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pasta and wings. We ordered a large pizza (Extra Chilli Chillies, Beef, and Chicken), a side of fries and a glass of milk. The pizza was tasty and I liked the size of the pizza. The pizza was hot and fresh and it was delivered to our door within 15 minutes of ordering. 6. Canteen on Broadway - Good Selection of Fast Food We ordered 3 meals from Canteen on Broadway. We ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips and Chicken Burger. The Caesar Salad was good but the chicken burger was bland. The fish and chips was good but the fries could have been a bit crispier. Canteen on Broadway also offers takeaway and delivery service. The service was good and we were served within 15 minutes of ordering. Canteen on Broadway is located at the Food Village. The Food Village is also home to many more eateries and cafes.

The horrible thing is.... I'm already a little antsy. It's been a while since I've been out of town. A while since I've had a vacation. A while since I've been to a place where I can let my hair down. I'm just excited to see what the day holds. Monday, January 23, 2012 When I started working at my old company, I was very young and it was all I knew. It was my first job and my whole world. I didn't have much experience or any real direction, so I went to a training seminar that was run by a local business development firm. They had a ton of great speakers and I learned so much. I remember sitting in my first class with a 20 year old executive from one of the largest companies in the world. He was the most amazing person I'd ever met. He was so knowledgeable and passionate about his job. He gave a great presentation about the importance of employee engagement. His passion was infectious. He spoke about how we all have a personal responsibility to each other, to be an example and to do our best. He challenged us to create a workplace where we all want to be and feel valued. I took his words to heart. That was the beginning of my career path. I spent the next several years learning and growing. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by people who have helped me and given me the opportunity to work in some of the best places in the world. I've learned a lot and been given a lot. And I've also lost a lot. I've had the opportunity to be part of some amazing teams and I've also been on the other side of that. The bottom line is, I've been lucky. I've been blessed with the opportunity to have a career that I love. I've been blessed with the opportunity to meet so many wonderful people and to learn from them. And, I've been blessed with the opportunity to make a difference. That's the thing that has been the most important to me. I don't think I'm special. I don't think I'm some kind of genius. I'm just a girl from the Midwest who's lucky to have had the opportunity to go to school and have a career. I want to make a difference. I want to have an impact. I want to have an impact on people's lives. And that's the thing I've realized. We have the opportunity to make a difference. We all have that ability. And we need to use it. I've had the opportunity to help people. I've had the opportunity to teach people and share my knowledge. I've had the opportunity to learn from people. I've had the opportunity to mentor and help others. I've had the opportunity to create a career and a life that I love. I've had the opportunity to have a place to call home. And I've had the opportunity to help my friends and family. I've had the opportunity to help others and have the opportunity to help myself. It's the same thing with work. We have the opportunity to make a difference. We have the opportunity to impact our team. We have the opportunity to make our team a better place. We have the opportunity to make our company a better place. We have the opportunity to make our industry a better place. We have the opportunity to make our community a better place. We have the opportunity to make our world a better place. We all have the opportunity to make a difference. We just need to take that opportunity. We just need to use that opportunity. I'm not special. I'm not a genius. I'm just a girl from the Midwest who has been blessed with the opportunity to do something that I love. I'm just a girl who's trying to make a difference. And, that's what I'm going to do. Sunday, January 22, 2012 This week has been a busy one. It's also been one of the most important weeks of my life. My 18 year old son graduated from high school and started college this week. I'm so proud of him. He's such a good kid. He's had some ups and downs in his life, but he's always come through in the end. He's a good kid. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of the work he's done in his life and the life he's created."
LLAMA,yelp-485,"Salty Senorita in Scottsdale.... mexican food, football on flat screens, outdoor seating, margaritas! Kinda sounds like a little piece of heaven to me? What's not to like, right? The horrible, horrible service. We decided to take advantage of happy hour on a Saturday afternoon. We sat outside in the beautiful Arizona weather and started to take in our surroundings. A couple of things caught my eye right away. We were sitting in the patio area that was between the restaurant and the bar. So I could see all the staff coming and going. I would estimate that there were 6 servers and 2 bartenders. I was sitting there for over 10 minutes before I was approached. I looked around and noticed that everyone else was being served, but me. Finally I was approached by a server and asked if I would like to order something. I asked for a drink and we looked over the happy hour menu. I chose the ""Pink Senorita"" margarita. After a few minutes my drink arrived. It was delicious. I am a big fan of the pomegranate margarita and this was just as good. Our waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order. I asked for a few minutes. After looking over the menu we decided on the queso fundido, guacamole, and a small order of chips and salsa. We sat for another 15 minutes or so before anything was brought out. The server finally came over and brought the queso and guacamole. After a few more minutes she came back and brought the chips and salsa. We were hungry at this point so we scarfed this down. The queso fundido was a bit of a disappointment. It was very thin and watery. I have had this dish several times before and it was usually thick and cheesy. It should be served with a spoon because of how thick and cheesy it is. This was not the case at Salty Senorita. The guacamole was good. It was nice and chunky. We enjoyed that. After we finished our appetizers we sat for another 10-15 minutes before the server came over to ask if we wanted to order something else. We placed our order. After another 20-30 minutes our order arrived. We ordered a couple of tacos. We got the grilled chicken taco and the carne asada taco. I wish I could say that the food was delicious. It was not. The grilled chicken was dry and overcooked. The carne asada was ok, but not much to write home about. Overall our experience at Salty Senorita was not good. The margaritas were delicious and the chips and salsa were good. But the service and the food were not good. I hope that this was just an off day. I will give Salty Senorita another shot on a different day. I hope that it is much better next time! If you have been to Salty Senorita, what was your experience like? Leave a comment below!"

He did everything he could to make it look as if his great idea for an amusement park and resort would be successful.

Now this is something you just don't hear about nowadays. No one serves savory breakfasts anymore.. After dinner Fred sat us all around the kitchen table and told stories from when he started at the place 20 years ago. Fred's favorite story always involved how somebody came up to him one night while he stood outside by the fireplace after work and said: In honor of Friday Night Lights Season 5 episode 4 and its 500th anniversary celebration, NBC has announced a series of upcoming special events, all starting tomorrow evening at 8 p.m. (ETPT).

Human,yelp-486,"Woohoo! Best Cirque show I've been to yet! Some might say I am biased because I have this love for Beatles music, but I think that the content of the show and the theatrics were very exciting from beginning to end. I was sitting on the second to the top tier as we had discounted locals tix and the view was still great. Granted, I would've liked to sit a little closer (for reasons that I will not disclose because there is a certain part of the show that gets the people up front involved) but watching from up top was still awesome. The music timed up with the theatrics was a real treat as well because it's 1) obviously the Beatles and 2) the mixing of the songs were seamless and flowed very nicely. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was my pricey beer. But, hey, it's the Mirage so what do you expect? Definitely a treat and I would highly recommend!"
Tsinghua,yelp-486,"Woohoo! Best Cirque show I've been to yet! Some might say I am biased because I have this love for Beatles music, but I think that the content of the show is just as important. It's not about Beatles music and nostalgia, but rather about the connection that humans have to music. And I think that's a really powerful message. (It was really fun watching the audience reactions.) That's one thing I've learned about Cirque. They have a very tight connection to the audience, and they know exactly how to connect with people. And it's not just in their shows. They have a lot of really interesting outreach programs, like the ""Cirque du Soleil You"" programs, which aim to connect people to the arts. In the US, they do a lot of concerts in school auditoriums, and in France, they do a lot of outreach in prisons. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Cirque. They have this very elaborate, very expensive show that seems to be about spectacle, and I'm not really interested in that. But I do like the way they connect with people, and I like that they make their shows so accessible. It's a bit of a departure from what I was used to before I started working for Cirque, but it's something that I'm really glad I've learned about. We're off to Paris tomorrow. My husband is going to work in Paris for the next couple of weeks, and I'm going to go with him. I'm really looking forward to it! (My next blog will probably be about our trip!) My life is kind of hectic at the moment. I'm trying to get all my marketing stuff done, so that I can start writing some more blogs for Cirque. I'm going to be doing some more blogging for Cirque, and I'll probably also be writing a couple of posts about Cirque for the marketing blog. My last post for the marketing blog is about making a sales call, so I'm going to do a quick post about the first time I ever made a sales call. I think that a lot of people have some misconceptions about sales calls. They think that they have to be loud and obnoxious, or that they have to talk fast and sell yourself in the first 30 seconds. But that's not how sales calls work. In fact, they work the exact opposite way. I learned this a long time ago, and I never forget it. I learned this when I was doing temp work. I was working as a temp at a store that sold tools, and I was doing the stocktaking part of the job. This was back in 1999, when it was a really busy time of year for tools, and the store was pretty busy. One of the stocktaking tasks was to make a sales call to the customers who were in the store that day. This was an interesting task, because you were supposed to make a sales call to each customer that came into the store, and tell them about the benefits of the tool that you were selling. I remember thinking to myself, ""Well, what if I can't find the customer that I'm supposed to talk to?"" The answer was pretty simple. You just talk to the customer that's right in front of you. The sales call was not about you. It was about the customer. And that's what I've always remembered. When you're doing a sales call, it's not about you. It's about the customer. And that's how you sell. It's not about you. You can talk about all the cool stuff that you have, but you have to sell it to the customer. And you have to do that in a way that makes the customer want to buy it. And if you're selling something like a product, you have to make the customer think that they need it. And if you're selling something like a service, you have to make the customer think that they're going to be happier with your service. So how do you do that? It's not about you. You have to find a way to make the customer want to buy it. And you have to do that in a way that the customer will remember you. So if you're selling a product, make the customer think that they need it. If you're selling a service, make the customer think that they're going to be happier with your service. Now, if you're not selling something, then what are you selling? It's the same thing. You have to make the customer think that they need it. You have to make the customer think that they're going to be happier with your product. And that's the magic of selling. If you can do that, you'll sell whatever you're selling."
BigScience,yelp-486,"Woohoo! Best Cirque show I've been to yet! Some might say I am biased because I have this love for Beatles music, but I think that the content of the songs is what makes it a true musical. There are definitely some great themes portrayed in shows like this (even if they aren't ever explicitly stated) and all in all it's an entertaining way to spend time with your friends! The other night I was out for dinner with my best friend named Liam (and his girlfriend named Ashlyn). We were talking about how we usually go on dates when we're both single - even though we've never really had much luck meeting people who weren't already dating someone else. One thing he said struck me as funny: ""When you ask girls on a date, do you always bring them flowers?"""

It was very well put together - not a moment of boredom, there was always something to watch, and all of the acts were original and entertaining. I absolutely loved the ""clown"" acts, and was laughing the whole time! The music was perfect, the singers were great, the musicians were tight. The only thing that could have made it better was if John, George, Paul and Ringo were there! Highly recommend this show - I'm going to see it again next time I'm in Vegas!"

The lights and the way they were used to create different scenes was so cool. The performers were also incredible. They were so talented and they did such an amazing job of telling the story of the Beatles. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of the Beatles or Cirque du Soleil. It was a truly unforgettable experience."

We ordered two Chinese buns for starters that weren't even cooked properly so eating them made me sick after trying to eat another half of one bun.. They left some ingredients in both dishes no more. And then when asked why there were only 2 pieces of pork rolls on our table instead of 4? The waiter explained he didn't have enough pork roll meat anymore because someone had already taken all theirs before us but what about the rest?? He never apologized or refunded any money back. It just makes you really feel disgusted!

They had a good selection of tires for my truck but I didn't need anything that day so they gave me some coupons which helped out quite alot I did everything possible to get a quote from Discount Tire. It was difficult since I live part time in Florida while working full-time as an RN in Texas. I returned two times due to scheduling issues when other employees said no problem. Finally after 3 trips, Discount Tires driver came around to help. He spoke English well enough to explain what it would cost. When he got back to his desk, though he talked about going home to treat himself to dinner (he's a chef), 2 hours later he called asked if I'd like him to come by again today or tomorrow. Unfortunately we do not take appointments...and traveling across town just because someone suggested calling the store doesn't seem fair. Anyway couldn't recommend them highly enough! Discount Tire has been great! All their prices are excellent and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. As long as I'm able to get there it's absolutely fine. My local Dunlop dealership wants 200.00 per wheel done, only less then 10.00each. On top of that, I've gotten ripped off due to poor quality wheels. This place is amazing!! Great customer service; cheapest price of all four locations I've seen. And I'm really not picky!!!! They are relatively new compared to most places here in Ocean Springs. Not much yet.

The entire atmosphere of the place is warm and welcoming, and the food is to die for. The inside of the restaurant is a bright, beautiful environment that is decked out in tropical decor.

To top off the deliciousness of the food, they serve it in generous portions. The service is great, and the prices are excellent.

Human,yelp-489,"There are many Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas, and it's a competitive cuisine to be in. Island Flavor has every right to be confident that they will be sticking around. The Husband first mentioned this place after he saw the sign go up replacing Pho 777. And he's been there a handful of times before I got a chance to check this place out. The first time he went, he was told to order the special and did as he was told. He remembers it being really good and was telling me all about it. The first time I went was to grab a spam musubi to go. It was pretty busy and I was intrigued. (The spam musubi was good too.) The next time the Husband stopped by for a to go order and brought home the special that had chicken in it. I remember trying some and thought it was good, although we weren't too happy about the mac salad. Also brought home a spam musubi too. When I finally had a chance to have a sit down meal there, I ordered the combo (9.75) of Kalbi Short Ribs Tender short ribs marinated in our Korean sauce broiled to perfection and the Furikake Shrimp Jumbo shrimp coated with panko and furikake fried golden brown and served with oriental sauce. It came with two scoops of rice and mac salad. What an order it was! Generous portions of three slabs of short ribs and so yummy! The three shrimps were also a good size and had a nice crust because of the panko. I was pleased. It was definitely a lot, and you will need a box for leftovers. The mac salad tasted a lot better this time around too. The Husband got the combo of Kalbi Short Ribs and Hawaiian Style Roast Pork Served open face topped with our homemade gravy and it was a large size order too. Also served with two scoops of rice and mac salad. They definitely make sure you don't go hungry here. He ate up the whole thing himself, and left with a full belly. As we were leaving, the Husband mentioned it would just be awesome if they offered dessert. I told him they did, I saw it on the menu! I think the next time around he may just save a bit of room for a sweet finish. I wish they offered my favorite - Pork Lau Lau! Overall, food is good and generous. Service comes with a smile and you definitely feel at home here. They get a lot of business, whether it's the weekend or a week night. The owner told us they have two restaurants already on the Big Island, so they know what makes a restaurant successful here. When you're dining in, you feel like everyone knows each other already. It's a nice feeling. They have coupons available on entertainmentbook.com, which we used. The owner also mentioned they have coupons available on restaurant.com too so we should look into that as well. (How sweet is it that they tell you about their coupons?!) This place will be sticking around - check it out for nicer, more authentic Hawaiian fare. (Pics posted!)"
Tsinghua,yelp-489,"There are many Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas, and it's a competitive cuisine to be in. Island Flavor has every right to be confident that they will be sticking around. The way they've been doing business and their success has been so promising that I would bet on it. Chef Daniel Segura is very proud of his food and his restaurants. He knows he's doing a good job and has every right to be. MY STYLE IS TO TAKE AMERICAN CUISINE AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE ROOTS OF WHAT IT IS. - DANIEL SEGURA I WOULD LOVE TO OPEN A SECOND LOCATION. - DANIEL SEGURA CHAPTER 20 THE CRISIS IN THE CHICKEN BUSINESS The most dramatic crisis in the poultry industry is over the chicken. - DANIEL SEGURA THE CRISIS IN THE CHICKEN BUSINESS D O I REALLY NEED TO SAY IT? No, I don't. The chicken business is in a crisis. I don't need to spell it out for you. You know it, and you know it's happening. I just wanted to add that it's not just one chicken business that is going through a crisis. The entire chicken industry is going through a crisis. I know, I know. Chickens are chickens. Chickens aren't going to fall off the planet, and they aren't going to starve to death. But, for the sake of argument, let's say they do. What would happen to all the chicken farmers? And what would happen to all the chicken restaurants? I have no idea. But I can tell you this: It would be a disaster. That's because chicken is an industry that is very heavily reliant on the rest of the economy. If the economy gets a little rocky, the chicken business goes down with it. Chicken is the biggest sector of the economy that's most dependent on a healthy economy. So it's really easy to see why the chicken business is in a crisis. And it's going to get worse. Here's the situation. The poultry industry is growing at a slower rate than the rest of the economy. And the poultry industry is losing money. Chicken is the biggest single industry in the United States, and it's also the most profitable industry. But right now it's losing money. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because chicken is a commodity product that has become too cheap. Maybe it's because it's becoming harder to find people to work in the chicken industry. Maybe it's because we have become more and more acculturated to eating chicken, and now we don't need to go to a chicken restaurant to get it. Maybe it's because the United States has grown fat and happy and doesn't need to eat as much chicken. Maybe it's because chicken is becoming too easy to get and too cheap to buy. Or maybe it's all of the above. I don't know. I'm not a chicken economist. I'm just a chicken guy. But I do know this: If we continue to eat chicken at the same rate we have been eating it, then the chicken industry will go down with the rest of the economy. This is the chicken business's biggest problem. It is an industry that is becoming more and more acculturated to eating chicken. The rest of the world is eating more chicken than we are. The only reason we eat so much chicken is because we eat so much chicken. Chicken is a big part of our diet. But if we continue to eat chicken at the same rate we have been eating it, then the chicken industry will go down with the rest of the economy. We will become a chicken nation. Chicken will become like butter or cheese. Chicken will become like pasta. Chicken will become like cereal. Chicken will become like milk. Chicken will become like... everything. We will become a chicken nation. Chicken will become like butter or cheese. Chicken will become like pasta. Chicken will become like cereal. Chicken will become like milk. Chicken will become like... everything. It's not going to happen overnight. But I think it's happening. And I think it's going to get worse. Chicken is the biggest sector of the economy that's most dependent on a healthy economy. If you were a chicken farmer, what would you do if you knew your business was going to go down with the rest of the economy? If you were a chicken restaurant, what would you do if you knew you were going to go down with the rest of the economy? I think we're all going to have to change our ways."

I sampled some sushi, tried one of the soups and ordered a noodle dish with chicken and shrimp and I was extremely satisfied with my choice. I did not try any dessert but, they had this unique cheesecake which looked awfully tempting. If only I had room left in the tank! An added bonus of Oasian is the affable staff.

LLAMA,yelp-490,"A wonderful Asian restaurant with the stated goal of bringing East Asian cuisine to the East Valley. The menu is a medley of foods from the East Asian bloc - Korea, Thailand, and Japan. The food is all very good, but the Korean food is especially noteworthy. The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, so parking is convenient. It is nicely decorated with a dark wood theme, and the service is very friendly. There is a full bar that also serves sake, and the alcohol selections are very reasonably priced. We started with the ""Japanese Hot Wings."" The name is a bit deceiving, as this was more like Korean Fried Chicken. The chicken was fantastic - the batter had a really nice crunch and was very flavorful, and the chicken was juicy and tender. I think this is my favorite fried chicken dish in the Valley, and it is a steal at only 9.95. For our main course, we ordered a variety of dishes to share. The Korean BBQ ribs were tender and well-seasoned, with a good smoky flavor. The ""Meat Lover's Lunchbox"" was a true Korean lunchbox. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the sides were just right. The Yakisoba was good, but a little bland. It could have benefited from a little more sauce or seasoning. The Miso Ramen was very good, and the broth was rich and flavorful. It was topped with a nice medley of vegetables and served with the traditional Japanese pork dumplings (which were just OK). The one disappointment of the meal was the Korean Fried Rice. It was flavorful, but contained just a few small pieces of meat and was mostly made up of carrots and egg. I highly recommend this restaurant for a nice meal with friends. The food is reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very nice. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu.

Tsinghua,yelp-492,"I just wanted to write you to express my extreme disappointment in the Waterfront location. My granddaughter and I bought two mollies last night around 8-8:30pm last night. One of the fish is still alive. The other one is dead. We left the store right after we bought them. When we got home, the one that was alive was dead. The manager was very nice. He even went to the front desk and called me a cab to take me home. He told me that he would give me a full refund. He even took a picture of the fish to send to me so I could make a complaint with your company. The fish that was dead was a large, almost 20"" long blue molly. He gave me a refund for it. The fish that is alive is a small 16"" blue molly. The manager gave me a full refund for the 16"" molly as well. I did not see any display signs indicating that the fish would die within a couple of hours. The fish should have been held in the fish tank until they could be checked. The dead fish was still alive when I got home. If you were to put the fish in a small glass bowl, they would have died immediately. It was almost 9pm when we bought the fish. They should have been in the tank until we were able to take them home. I'm sure you'll get this complaint. It's a shame that I would have to write this letter. I just wanted to express my extreme disappointment in your Waterfront location. I'm so sorry you were disappointed. I apologize for the experience you had. The location in the Waterfront is our busiest location and we strive to make sure we provide our customers with excellent service. Our fish tanks are cleaned daily, but it is not always possible to keep fish in the tanks until customers can pick them up.

Eleuther-AI,yelp-492,"I just wanted to write you to express my extreme disappointment in the Waterfront location. My granddaughter and I bought two mollies last night around 8-8:30pm last night. One of them was a boy, about 5 inches long (we had already fed him several times at another aquarium's pet store) out by himself when we arrived for only 10 minutes before closing time... it is now 9am today he has not been seen since! The other one got away from us while taking pictures with our phones so that shows how much they were interested; however there are no security tags or collars on these fish yet although all their tanks have lockable lids? There weren't even any signs posted until after this happened unfortunately!! They make excuses saying ""it could be anywhere"" but if anyone knows anything as far fetched than what actually occurred here let me know because obviously something went wrong - either way its upsetting!!!"

One of the mollies died within 24 hours of being brought home. I understand that fish can be fragile creatures and difficult to care for, but I also feel that the employees at the Waterfront location did not provide adequate information or assistance in ensuring the health of the fish we purchased. Additionally, the water in the tank appeared cloudy and dirty, which could be a sign of poor maintenance. As a loyal customer of your store, I expect better service and attention to the health and wellbeing of the pets you sell. I would appreciate if you could look into this matter and possibly improve the training and care of your employees at the Waterfront location. Thank you for your attention to this matter."

One of them died over night. When I took the dead fish back to the store to exchange it they gave me a hard time. Saying I needed a water sample. I told them I've bought many fish from them in the past and never had to bring in a water sample to exchange a fish. (I own two fish tanks. One 55 gallon and one 40 gallon). I wasn't asking for my money back, I just wanted another fish. They refuse and the manager walked away from me saying that's our policy. I got my money back for the fish, but they no longer have a customer. I also own a business in Homestead and would never treat my customers that way. Especially if I wanted to keep a good reputation. They have lost a customer who has spent hundreds of dollars at that location over a 4 fish. Here is the fish return policy they have listed online. No where does it say you need a water sample. Petco's commitment to our customers: All freshwater fish purchased at petco.com are guaranteed to stay alive for 30 days from the day they arrive at your home or we will gladly refund your money. All marine species, live rock and plants are guaranteed for 15 days from delivery. I will now have to drive 10 miles out of my way to another pet store, but they will NEVER see another dime from me.

One of them, a black molly, was acting lethargic and not swimming around like the other molly was. I took the black molly back to the store about 10 minutes later and explained to the cashier what was going on. She told me that she would take the fish back and give me a full refund. I thanked her and left the store. I got home and put the other molly in my aquarium. The black molly was still in the bag. I decided to take a look at it and see if I could figure out what was wrong with it. When I opened the bag, I noticed that the black molly was dead. I was very upset and disappointed. I called the Waterfront location and spoke to the same cashier that I had spoken to earlier. I told her that the fish was dead and that I wanted a refund. She told me that I could not get a refund because I had already left the store. I was very frustrated and told her that I would never shop at the Waterfront location again. I am very disappointed with the way that I was treated by the Waterfront location. I feel like I was taken advantage of and that my money was not well spent.

One of them was a perfectly fine looking fish, but it had no scales on one side of its head (see photo). We called back about 45 minutes later after we were told they'd be out for our delivery another hour or so because there's some equipment problems with the cooler room at 9am next morning. Once again we waited until almost 10PM before finally receiving this fish as an apology from Lavelle who worked on the counter that day. To make matters worse she sent us home while her supervisor came over. She said she didn't know what else to tell me other than it's ""going through."" The only thing going through? Her attitude towards customers!"

One of the mollies died this morning. I have two large tanks at home and have never had a fish die before. I don't believe the molly was handled properly by the staff. I was very disheartened when we left there last night with the molly. The staff person was rude and I had to ask her to fill the bag with water before I would take the fish home. I am requesting a refund for the dead fish. I will never return to this location or shop at any of your other locations. My husband and I went into the Waterfront Petco to purchase a Betta fish for our son. We were in your store for less than 10 minutes. We were told that we were not allowed to use a coupon that was valid for that day. The coupon was for 5 off a fish. We were told by the staff that we would have to buy 15 worth of other items in order to use the coupon. The staff was rude and condescending. We have shopped at Petco for years and have always had great experiences. We were so disappointed in our experience today that we left without purchasing the fish. We will never shop in this store again. My wife and I walked into your store today and were disgusted with the way we were treated by two of your employees. The manager could see how we were treated and didn't even care to do anything about it. The Petco is in New Hyde Park, NY 11040. We went in to look at the fish and we were bothered by these two workers who were talking in a vulgar way, cussing and talking about getting laid and all other sexual things. We asked them to tone it down and one of them said ""it's not our problem, it's the fish tank's problem."" If you can't see how this is wrong, you shouldn't be in business."

Eleuther-AI,yelp-493,"Wow wow wow really great place. I threw my bf a surprise birthday party here...which at first I thought was a nice bar and grill but the morning of the event they said it wasn't quite open yet (when we got there) so now i'm pissed off because frickin' EVERYTHING is closed! The one time thing, if you ever do decide to go in can be very fun....but that's about all:)"
PaLM,yelp-493,Wow wow wow really great place. I threw my bf a surprise birthday party here...which at first I thought was a nice bar and grill but the morning of the party I got a call from the owner saying he had planned a whole afternoon of activities for us. He had a limo pick us up at our hotel and take us to a few other fun places in the area before taking us to the restaurant. We had a great time at the restaurant eating and drinking and then were taken back to our hotel. I was so impressed with the service and the way we were treated. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great place to eat and have a fun time. The restaurant is located in the heart of the city and has a great view of the skyline. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great meal and a fun time.
Human,yelp-493,"Wow wow wow really great place. I threw my bf a surprise birthday party here...which at first I thought was a nice bar and grill but the morning of the party I drove 30 minutes here to drop off the cake....and was kinda shock to find that it was kinda like a dive bar. Usually I wouldn't pick places like that but since it was a party of 30, I wasn't going to change the place just because there's peanut shells all over the place. But really it turned out to be a great place that had a perfect area that sat all 30 of us. The service was really wonderful...when I called in to make the reservation twice...since at first I thought it would only be a party of 10 but more people decided to come so it went up to 30, the guy that took the reservation was really nice about it, even asked me if I was bringing a cake. The waitress that served us was also pretty awesome. The portions of the food was huge and cheap and oOoh the wings are a bomb and what was even better was for Tuesdays it's only 6.50 for a dozen of any flavor wings. Overall I am very satisfied and happy with this place and the party was a hit...although I think we were their biggest party there because if it wasn't for us I think the place would have been pretty dead....There weren't too many people there for dinner. Anyways I would happily come back here."

I threw my bf a surprise birthday party here...which at first I thought was a nice bar and grill but the morning of the party when I arrived to decorate, I was blown away by the space. The staff were incredibly accommodating and helpful throughout the planning and execution of the party. The food was delicious and the drinks were on point. My boyfriend was thrilled with the surprise and everyone had a great time. Highly recommend this place for any type of event or just a night out."
