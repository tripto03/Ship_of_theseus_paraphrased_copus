Tsinghua,tldr-0,"In a project called Mission Shakti, India has successfully tested its Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile, which destroyed a low-orbiting satellite on Wednesday. While it is unknown who the satellite belonged to, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) claims that the test was conducted at the Earth-Sun Lagrange Point (L2) - a region between Earth and the Sun, and where no satellites are currently orbiting. ISRO chief K Sivan claimed that the mission was a ""pre-emptive action"" to protect India's satellite space and that the test has shown that ""India can defend itself against any external threat."" The test was part of India's Agni series of missiles. This missile was launched at a height of 220 kilometers, and reached an altitude of 430 kilometers. The missile then de-orbited itself and successfully destroyed a satellite that was in orbit. The test has been approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The satellite, known as Inmarsat-5 F4, was in a 700-kilometer orbit. It was owned by the British satellite company Inmarsat. A statement from the company said that the satellite was launched in 2008, and that it had been in orbit for more than a decade. ISRO's latest test comes just weeks after a Chinese satellite, which was also in a low orbit, was destroyed by an ASAT missile. That test was part of the country's annual anti-satellite test, and it was conducted on September 25. India is a member of the Outer Space Treaty, and it has previously stated that it does not have the intention of targeting other countries' satellites. However, ISRO's statement has been criticized by several experts, who say that the missile was fired at a point in space that is not currently occupied by a satellite. ""India has not used its ASAT missile in the past and has no right to threaten other countries' space assets with the same missile,"" India's former Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal P.K. Bhadauria, said."

In a statement, the government said, ""The test was fully successful and achieved all parameters as per plans."" The test comes a day after India carried out an air strike on terror camps across the border. According to the statement, the anti-satellite weapon, A-SAT, was developed indigenously and all its sub-systems were developed indigenously. This is the first time India has tested an anti-satellite missile. It is the fourth country to do so, after the United States, Russia, and China. In response to the development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the scientists on the successful test. ""Mission Shakti was a highly complex one, conducted at extremely high speed with remarkable precision. It shows the remarkable dexterity of India's outstanding scientists and the success of our space programme,"" he said. The PM further added that the mission has made India a space power. ""India has always been a space power. It is time the country becomes an important player in the advancement of space technology,"" he said. He said that India's action was not directed against any country and it does not violate the Outer Space Treaty and international laws.

PaLM,tldr-2,"Range types allow developers to store various kinds of intervals with upper and lower bounds. The multirange feature allows developers to store multiple ranges within a single column. This can be useful for storing data such as temperature ranges, date ranges, or geographic ranges."
OpenAI,tldr-2,"PostgreSQL 14 has a new multirange feature that makes range types in PostgreSQL more powerful. Range types allow developers to store various kinds of intervals with upper and lower bounds. That's correct! PostgreSQL 14 introduced a new multirange data type that can be used to store multiple ranges in a single column. This feature can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to store multiple ranges of values, such as when working with time intervals or geographical data. With multiranges, you can create a column that can store multiple range values without resorting to complex table structures or additional columns. You can also perform range-based queries on multiranges, such as finding entries within a particular range or checking if a range intersects with another range. To create a multirange column, you can use the 'multirange' data type along with the range subtype you want to use. For example, if you want to store date ranges, you can use the 'daterange' subtype along with 'multirange', like so: "" ' CREATE TABLE events (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, dateranges daterange; "" ' Then, you can insert data into this column using multirange literals, such as: "" ' INSERT INTO events (name, dateranges) VALUES Event A', 2022-01-01, 2022-01-03) ,"" 2022-01-07, 2022-01-09) ; "" ' Overall, multirange data types in PostgreSQL 14 can simplify data storage and querying for scenarios where you need to work with multiple ranges."
BigScience,tldr-2,"PostgreSQL 14 has a new multirange feature that makes range types in PostgreSQL more powerful. Range types allow developers to store various kinds of intervals with upper and lower bounds. This is much like multi-dimensional arrays, but without the overhead of having many different dimensions. There are two ways you can use these newly added range types: using named ranges or by creating custom types for your project's needs. Say you want to create an interval table with columns representing four time periods separated into years from 2010 through 2019. You could write: This syntax creates a table whose name contains all three of the time periods: yearlyperiods (2010-2019) as well as monthlyperiods1 (January-December) and dayperiods2 (Monday-Sunday). Since this table uses a combination of names, it would be very easy to forget about any specific values associated with one row while typing another query. For example, if we wanted to delete rows where date (transactiondate) fell between January 1 and December 31, 2014, we'd have to:"
Tsinghua,tldr-2,"PostgreSQL 14 has a new multirange feature that makes range types in PostgreSQL more powerful. Range types allow developers to store various kinds of intervals with upper and lower bounds. You can use range types to represent dates, times, time intervals, and more. The new multirange feature makes it possible to use multiple range types at the same time. This is a big deal because it allows you to store ranges with different properties, such as dates and times. For example, you can use a date range type to store dates, and a time range type to store times. You can then use a single multirange type to store a date range and a time range. The result is a multirange that can represent a date range and a time range, for example. Let's see how this works. I'll start by defining a multirange type that stores a date range and a time range. CREATE TYPE multirange AS (mindate date, maxdate date, mintime time, maxtime time); CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION multirangedemo RETURNS TABLE (startdate date, enddate date, starttime time, endtime time) AS func DECLARE vdate date; vtime time; BEGIN SELECT MIN (startdate), MAX (startdate), MIN (starttime), MAX (starttime) INTO vdate, vtime FROM multirange; SELECT MIN (enddate), MAX (enddate), MIN (endtime), MAX (endtime) INTO vdate, vtime FROM multirange; RETURN QUERY SELECT startdate, enddate, starttime, endtime FROM multirange; END func LANGUAGE plpgsql; Now let's define a table that uses the multirange type. CREATE TABLE mytable (id serial PRIMARY KEY, startdate multirange, enddate multirange, starttime multirange, endtime multirange); INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (1, SUBDATE 2019-01-01', '1 day, SUBDATE 2019-01-01', '1 day, SUBTIME 19:00', '19:00, SUBTIME 19:00', '19:00; INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (2, SUBDATE 2019-01-02', '1 day, SUBDATE 2019-01-02', '1 day, SUBTIME 19:00', '19:00, SUBTIME 19:00', '19:00; SELECT FROM mytable; id startdate enddate starttime endtime 1 2019-01-01 2019-01-01 19:00:00 19:00:00 2 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 19:00:00 19:00:00 (2 rows) I can now insert multiple rows using the multirange type."

LLAMA,tldr-3,"The resignations of Larry Page and Sergey Brin from their roles as CEO and president of Alphabet marked the end of an era. The pair cited changes to Google's all-hands meetings, in which they say they are no longer able to speak freely, as one of the reasons for their departure. But now they're reassuring employees that they are not stepping back from the company. Alphabet's CEO and president, respectively, will remain on the board and ""deeply engaged"" Brin and Page founded Google in 1998, and for the first 11 years were both CEO and president. In 2011, they stepped back to become co-CEOs of a new entity, Alphabet, and hired Sundar Pichai to become CEO of Google. Brin and Page stepped back again in 2015, naming Pichai as CEO of Alphabet too. In the original letter announcing their resignations, Brin and Page wrote, ""We are deeply humbled to have seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment for billions - a bet we made as two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets."" Now, in a letter to employees, they write, ""We will continue talking with Sundar regularly, especially on topics we're passionate about!,"" and explain that they will still be involved in the company. Page and Brin are stepping down amid growing public criticism of the company and its leaders. A New York Times report last month alleged that Google shielded executives accused of sexual misconduct. Earlier this year, employees organized in protest of the company's involvement in the US military's drone program, Project Maven, and the company's development of a censored search engine for China. The pair's resignations were announced on the same day that Alphabet was reported to be facing a federal antitrust probe and dozens of state attorneys general were set to announce a separate probe into Google. ""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,"" Page and Brin write in their letter. ""While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it's time to assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!"" But they also note, ""We are deeply humbled to have seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment for billions - a bet we made as two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets."" The resignations are effective immediately. Pichai will remain CEO of Alphabet and Google."
BigScience,tldr-3,"The resignations of Larry Page and Sergey Brin from their roles as CEO and president of Alphabet marked the end of an era. The pair cited changes to Google's all-hands -on-deck culture, driven by fear over losing control. Those in charge now have a difficult task: create a cohesive vision for what has become the world's most valuable company with no one person telling them exactly where they should go next. Google still relies on its core ad business, but is increasingly turning away from it toward new revenue streams such as cloud computing, navigation software and smartphones made by Motorola Mobility Inc. (MOT), which was acquired last November for 12 billion (S18.09 billion). However, despite these efforts, investors remain wary about how effectively Google will be able to scale up its businesses and continually innovate without its two founders at the helm. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporean prime minister who died in September aged 91, once said that ""without passion there can never be success"" - especially when things are going well. Google shares fell 3 per cent yesterday after Mr Page announced his departure via video message over social media platforms. He did not elaborate further on why he stepped down or give any reason behind those decisions. These developments mark another chapter in a tale of personal rivalry between Mr Page and Mr Brin, which began nearly 20 years ago, when both men were card-carrying members of Stanford University's computer science department. They soon became rivals studying artificial intelligence (AI) during their graduate studies under professor Licklider, then head of USARPA, which funded research into AI back in 1965. By 1976, while working together on projects involving image recognition algorithms, they decided to quit Stanford and set off on separate paths towards building today's online search tools we use every day - one starting a start-up called AltaVista, and the other joining Microsoft Corp., founded 13 years earlier by Bill Gates. Both companies eventually merged to form Bing, whose name changed slightly before becoming part of Google in 2008. In 2003, Sergey Brin left Microsoft to join Yahoo!, where he spent 12 years until 2012. In 2011, Mr Mark Zuckerberg bought him out for US2 billion. But just six months later, Mr Page joined Google on a 1 million pay offer, bringing the total price tag for his move to Silicon Valley to 2.1 billion. The decision landed Mr Page squarely in the spotlight, given that the executives had previously been used as symbols of power for employees and customers alike even though many felt the firm could do better if it kept both individuals around. Both went through corporate restructurings following their departures. After leaving Google, Mr Page worked briefly as senior advisor to Tesla Motors Co's chief executive Elon Musk, before returning to directing YouTube. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes also hired Page as director of engineering for his ambitious Project Soli project aimed at developing self-driving cars. But he later resigned due to disagreements with management. During this period, Mr Page continued to put forward ideas related to autonomous vehicles and deep learning technologies amid strong criticism from some within Google itself. His technology breakthroughs include Deep Dream, a machine-learning framework that allowed machines to learn to recognise images; BlueDot, a capable system that detects human activity using radar data; and TensorFlow, a programming language designed to make data processing easier. On Tuesday night, Mr Page posted a short video explaining why he had left Google. ""The world I built here is changing rapidly... I want more freedom, ambition and resources than I've ever seen anywhere else,"" wrote the former Google employee. He added: ""We've grown too big and our leadership structure isn't suited to growing so fast. Late last year, Google tried to get rid of me because I told my friends I'd leave, but I've stayed anyway since I wanted to stay longer.... I'm proud of everything we've accomplished here over the past 15 years,... [but] there's much we don't understand yet. That's OK, that's good. It's exciting!""

BigScience,tldr-6,"Tesla's 100MW Powerpack battery has provided South Australia with the same grid services as peaker plants, but cheaper, quicker, and with zero-emissions through its battery system. The energy system cost (excluding capital expenditure) of a Tesla battery is just 1-2 compared to an equivalent plant from coal or gas, if it operates continuously rather than being used only in peaks. The ability for batteries to provide reliable peak power makes them all the more suitable when wind capacity increases rapidly: they can be quick enough to respond during large swings in demand that would otherwise require costly pumped hydro storage on top of large-scale fossil-fired generation, especially since there are several thousand possible charging points across SA ready at any time for residential consumers who want renewable electricity with no carbon emissions. In addition, battery storage delivers additional benefits such as balancing supply and consumption; reducing variability by partially offsetting high or low seasonal demands; enabling better use of variable renewables like solar PV and energy efficiency; ensuring reliability even when transmission infrastructure fails; potentially supporting local generation sources like small-scale hydropower plants; and providing resilience against extreme events which could damage conventional generators like fires and floods."

Additionally, the battery has provided greater reliability and stability to the state's electricity grid."
LLAMA,tldr-6,"Tesla's 100MW Powerpack battery has provided South Australia with the same grid services as peaker plants, but cheaper, quicker, and with zero-emissions through its battery system. The energy system cost the state only 36 cents per citizen, yet it has made over 800,000 in profits in the first 6 months. The Powerpack system in South Australia has saved consumers over 30 million in one year, with the ability to charge and discharge rapidly, a capability that many other grid services companies are unable to provide. Tesla's battery has been able to help the grid during a time when gas generators have failed. The Powerpack system was able to help the state meet peak demand in less than 100 milliseconds after the failure of the coal-fired Loy Yang Power Plant. Tesla has released a statement regarding the success of their Powerpack system in South Australia. ""With 100 megawatts of storage capacity, Hornsdale Power Reserve is the largest lithium-ion battery in the world and will play a major role in South Australia's continued transition to renewable energy. The battery will provide essential grid stability and reliability services for the region while also lowering costs for consumers and reducing carbon emissions."" The Hornsdale Power Reserve is a 100MW129MWh Tesla Powerpack system that stores renewable energy and delivers it to the grid when it is needed, especially during peak hours when power is needed most. The Powerpack system has also been able to make 1 million in grid services in the first 6 months of operations, exceeding the expectations of the operators. ""We're pleased to see the Hornsdale Power Reserve performing as expected. We are seeing early signs of the potential for battery storage to provide similar benefits in other areas of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM),"" says Matt Zema, CEO of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). In the first 6 months, the Powerpack system has helped to stabilize and support South Australia's grid, as well as help lower energy prices for consumers. ""We are delighted that Hornsdale Power Reserve is performing well and playing an important role in maintaining the reliability and security of South Australia's electricity supply,"" says Tesla. South Australia has been hit hard by power outages, most notably in the summer of 2016 when the entire state was left in darkness due to a storm that brought down the grid. The Powerpack system was able to help South Australia through the summer of 2017 and 2018. The Hornsdale Power Reserve is able to provide grid services to the state during the day and night, which is a great benefit as the state relies heavily on renewable energy sources. Tesla's Powerpack system is able to help South Australia reach their goal of 100 renewable energy by 2025."

Karate provides a framework for Web APIs and Mobile Apps (including hybrid apps). Tests can be executed using the JUnit runner, which provides parallel-execution, or by using a Maven plugin. Sauce Labs supports the testing of mobile apps using Karate. This doc assumes you're familiar with writing Karate tests. See Karate for the details. This will prompt you for the Sauce Labs username and access key. You'll be able to specify a platform to run your tests on. When your tests execute, you will be able to view the results in the Sauce Labs Dashboard. You can also use a Maven plugin to run tests. You will need to configure your Karate Maven plugin to use Sauce Labs, following the steps outlined above. How long should a mobile test be? This is a very subjective question, and depends on the nature of the app you are testing. However, 3 to 5 minutes is a good target. If you have an app that is very intensive, with lots of interactivity, then you may be running your test for 15 minutes or more. If you have an app that is mostly static, with a small number of interactions, then you can probably test the whole thing in 3 minutes. You can also target different test durations for different Sauce Labs platforms. For example, you can target a test duration of 5 minutes for iOS 9.3 and a test duration of 10 minutes for Android 4.4."

LLAMA,tldr-10,"Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans learn to walk by interacting with the world, by falling, and by making mistakes. To better understand how this adaptive learning works, the researchers used an agent to interact with a virtual world, and by observing how the agent adapted to the terrain in that virtual world, the researchers were able to extract the principles that could be applied to real-world walking robots. The new model, Rapid Motor Adaptation, offers a way to enable a robot to learn to navigate a physical environment through trial and error. The system consists of a learning agent and a planner. The planner identifies obstacles and plans a path the robot can follow that will allow it to reach the goal. The learning agent controls the robot, which gathers new data on the environment as it interacts with it. The learning agent then uses the new data to make small changes to the behavior of the robot. This process continues until the robot reaches the goal. The learning agent uses what is known as a hierarchical representation to make adjustments to the robot's behavior. That means that the agent makes changes to the robot's gait and balance first. Only if those changes don't allow the robot to reach the goal will the agent make changes to the robot's walking behavior. The researchers tested the model in simulations and then on a real-world robot, the Cassie bipedal robot. The system was able to successfully navigate unfamiliar terrain and climb stairs. The model is a form of reinforcement learning. The agent learns through trial and error, and it is able to adapt quickly. The system is also efficient because it is only the learning agent that is updating as the robot walks, and the planner is not updating during this time. ""The key to this system is that it learns to adapt the gait and step size to the terrain,"" said Sergey Levine, assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab. ""This system is a first step towards robots that can learn to master their environment through interaction.""

BigScience,tldr-10,"Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans and animals adapt their movements according to how they are moving. The researchers used Deep Learning - a type of machine learning technique where computers learn by analyzing large databases with big data sets, or huge groups of data points - to train the robot on these physical difficulties. Essentially this means having two cameras; one taking photos as the robot moves forward through its environment, while another takes pictures when it stops covering an area so the computer can see what's around the corner. The images were then fed into SuperMaker, which is part of Facebook's Neural Architecture Search Engine (NASE), which uses deep neural networks built using TensorFlow to find solutions automatically. This meant solving problems like obstacles and bumps more quickly than previous models, allowing robots such as AlphaGo to become much better at playing Go. In fact, there has been some debate about whether we should call them machines rather than artificial intelligence systems since they seem to be influenced by human experience and knowledge - meaning even if AlphaGo never played against a living player, it would still outperform other games programs because it acquired valuable skills over time. ""The way we think about our brains going back thousands of years says you don't need to know anything outside your body before getting started running - and that's exactly what SuperMaker does"" said Mark Goodman, CEO of NASE. ""It builds machines that only need to understand concepts within their own field of expertise. Even though it's not actively trying to play chess, there's enough information stored inside it that it will figure out the best move based off recent experiences."

The report is broken down into three sections: Trending Content, Top Search Terms, and Top Domains. It doesn't give the percentage of the content that each of these items made up of the content viewed, but the chart below does show that there were far more viral posts than either images or links. And if you're wondering how the top 20 viral posts compared to the top 20 viral images and links, the answer is that they didn't. For viral posts, the top 20 were all videos, and the top 20 images were all still images. Of course, if you look at the chart showing the top 20 domains, there's some overlap between the top 20 images and links. Most of the top 20 images are either YouTube videos or posts from Facebook, while most of the top 20 links are either links to Facebook posts or YouTube videos. Overall, the data seems to show that the content that was most popular with Facebook users was videos and posts from other people. It's interesting to see what was popular, but it's also interesting to see how Facebook is prioritizing content.

BigScience,tldr-12,"Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling long and unstructured text. The motivation behind this work came from the observation that, while we have many datasets with information about each word's position within the sequence (such as parts-of-speech), there are very few such datasets where the words themselves can be labeled. This motivates our focus on learning both labels as well as positions over time, building into an end-to-end system which allows us not only to learn the best possible feature extractor but also obtain useful insights into how data about different entities interact together throughout the conversation. Our contributions include: We introduce Conversation-RNN: An architecture specifically designed to model interactions between multiple discourse participants using Recurrent Neural Networks; On diverse domains: Our approach is able to generalize across three domains - (1) restaurant reviews, (2) news articles, and (3) social media posts. In all cases, it outperforms strong baselines; Insightful results: We show in detail what features contribute most strongly towards the task of determining the next sentence label; Prediction accuracy versus training time: We demonstrate experimentally that predictions made by Conversation-RNN converge faster than those obtained via other models when trained under identical conditions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related works, including some recent advances. Sections 3 gives details regarding our proposed model, along with experimental results showing advantages compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, conclusions are given in section 4. Related Work Researchers have addressed similar problems like ours before, albeit without recurrent connections. For example, (Nguyen et al., 2005) discuss several methods for predicting mutual attention scores between two sentences based upon their syntactic similarity. (Wang Jiang, 2010) propose elements for developing a transition-based dependency parser based on synchronous context-free grammars. However, these previous methods do not address aspects such as entity identification or explicit modeling of temporal relationships between events. Also unlike these earlier efforts, the current research does not require any hand-crafted linguistic rules or edit distance measures. As discussed below however, existing techniques may provide guidance toward better performing systems. Modeling Temporal Information While early attempts used linear chains (i.e., Markov Models) (Church Hanks, 1990), more complex non-linear models were later developed for various applications. For example, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was successfully applied in speech recognition (Rabiner, 1989). Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Elman, 1990; Hochreiter Schmidhuber, 1997) have been widely adopted for sequence modeling because they capture long-term dependencies among inputs through hidden states. Inspired by these developments, researchers began applying them to natural language generation tasks like machine translation (Bojar et al., 2006). In contrast to such traditional uses of RNNs, which seek to generate one single output per input, the main goal of Sequence-to-Sequence Learning (SSTL) tasks is usually to extract sequential patterns rather than produce outputs directly. One popular example is presented by (Bahdanau et al., 2014a). Here authors use SSTL networks to predict human-level sentiment for English tweets. They then extend this technique to Chinese tweets using an adaptation layer (Gong, 2015). Following closely after the success of CNNs on ImageNet classification task (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), another major breakthrough in deep architectures has come recently thanks to LeCun et al.. These authors showed that convolutional layers help deal with low level visual perception tasks beyond finding edges such as object detection, segmentation, etc. By transferring knowledge learned in images to transcripts gathered from chatbots, they also revealed potential improvements to automatic evaluation metrics for spoken dialogue systems. Convolution filters operating on image signals often correspond to convolutions performed on continuous-time signals called LSTMs. Therefore, inspired by the use of dilated convolution operations (Heinrich et al., 2016), Grave et al. incorporated dilations inside the structure of their Long Short-Term Memory network (GSD-LSTM). In doing so, they achieved significantly improved performance over standard LSTMs on several benchmark tasks, (Graves et al., 2017a). More precisely, GSD-LSTM achieves a significant improvement in relation extraction since they leverage key frames extracted from the video instead of simply extracting neighboring pixels during decoding times. Further, they tackle the problem of missing tokens in real-life scenarios, e.g., in case of dialogues recorded by the microphone arrays surrounding speakers. Such situations result in discontinuous datasets meaning that labels cannot be assigned too far away from the initial ones (Etzioni et al., 2004). Inspired by the idea of incorporating time-series convolutions in order to represent time series, we apply the same concept hereafter. However, unlike other novelty-wise approaches proposed previously, we exploit additional spatial dimensions to perform joint representation of textual and graphical contents appearing in conversations. Moreover, contrary to prior experiments involving longterm memory networks dedicated solely to detecting inter-participant interaction behaviors, our analysis focuses primarily on modeling the"
Tsinghua,tldr-12,"Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling language. They also have been used in other fields such as bioinformatics and finance. Recurrent Neural Networks consist of two main parts: the input and the recurrent layer. The input layer takes in data and provides it to the recurrent layer, which then produces the output. The output of the recurrent layer is passed back to the input layer and the process repeats itself. These networks are different from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) because they do not process images. In order to process data, you must define what the input and output are. In this example, the input is a word and the output is a set of probabilities for each of the words in the vocabulary. You also define the probability distribution over the vocabulary. For example, in this example, the probability distribution would be defined as: If the probability distribution is defined, you can feed data into the network and see how it performs. The output of the network will be the probability distribution. For this example, the network will output a probability distribution of 0.0125 for the word 'banana' and 0.00001 for the word 'pebble'. If the network is trained properly, the output should always be close to the desired output. You can train an RNN by feeding it data, or you can train it using a optimizer. In this example, the network will be trained using backpropagation. This is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that will automatically optimize the network. You can define the loss function as the sum of the negative log-likelihood of the data. In this example, the loss function is defined as the sum of the negative log-likelihood of the word 'banana' and the sum of the negative log-likelihood of the word 'pebble'. This will be the loss function that is used to train the network. When the network is trained, the gradient is calculated using the backpropagation algorithm. The gradient of the loss function is then used to update the weights in the network. The loss function and gradient are also defined for this example. Once the weights in the network are updated, the network is then trained. The weights in the network are then frozen and the network is tested on new data. This is done to prevent the network from adapting to the training data and become stuck in a local minimum. You can test the network by passing in a word. The output of the network should be close to the desired output. If the network is trained properly, the output should always be close to the desired output.

OpenAI,tldr-12,"Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling sequential data such as text. RNNs work by passing information along a chain of neurons, where each neuron receives input from the previous neuron and outputs to the next neuron. This allows the network to maintain a ""memory"" of the previous inputs and the order in which they were presented. One significant advantage of RNNs is their ability to handle varying length input sequences, making them suitable for tasks such as text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and many others. However, a common issue with RNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur when the gradients become too small, making it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies. To overcome this issue, various modifications to the basic RNN architecture have been developed, such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which have proven to be effective in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem while maintaining the benefits of RNNs."

In this article, we will explore a Recurrent Neural Network in Python using Keras. By the end of this article, you should have a basic understanding of how to build a Recurrent Neural Network in Python. The topic of Recurrent Neural Networks is very broad, so this article is just a starting point. After reading this article, you might also be interested in checking out my article on LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) since LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network. The data that we will use for this tutorial will be the Shakespeare dataset. The Shakespeare dataset contains the complete works of William Shakespeare. We will only use the text portion of the dataset, and we will use the first 25,000 characters to train our model. The first 25,000 characters of Shakespeare's plays is 10,471 words. There are 1,126 unique words in this portion of the dataset. The first 3 unique words are 'a', 'an', and 'and'. If we train our Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next word in a sequence of text, then we would expect 'the' to be the most likely next word since 'the' is the 4th most common word in the dataset. To start, we will need to import the packages we will need for this tutorial. We will need to import the Keras package for the backend of our Recurrent Neural Network. In addition, we will need to import the Tensorflow backend for Keras to use for its calculations. In addition to the Keras and Tensorflow backend packages, we will also need to import a few other packages. We will need to import the numpy package to work with arrays. We will also need the sklearn package to load the Shakespeare dataset. We will use numpy arrays to store our dataset and to store the weights and biases of our network. The sklearn package will help us load the Shakespeare dataset. Next, we will load the Shakespeare dataset. We will use the loadfiles method to load the dataset into the array we defined. The loadfiles method will load the file into a pandas dataframe, so we will need to convert the dataframe to a numpy array before we can use it. After we have loaded the dataset into a numpy array, we will split the dataset into training and testing subsets. We will use the randomstate parameter to avoid having the same training and testing subsets every time we train the network. We will use the trainingsize parameter to specify the number of samples we want to use for the training subset. We will use the remaining samples in the testing subset. Once we have split the dataset, we will create a helper function to build a dictionary mapping between a word and the index of that word. The first time we call this function, the dictionary will be empty. The first time we add a word to the dictionary, we will add it as a key. The subsequent times we add a word to the dictionary, we will use that word as the key and the index as the value. Next, we will loop through our dataset to create the dictionary we will use for the next step of our tutorial. For each word in the dataset, we will add that word to our dictionary with the index as the value. Now, we will loop through the dataset again to create a new array that will have the index of each word as the value. Next, we will convert the index values of our new array into one-hot encodings. This will create a matrix that has a dimension of words x samples. In addition to converting our dataset into a matrix, we will also create a one-hot encoding of the training labels. We will use this one-hot encoding of the labels to make sure that our Recurrent Neural Network is predicting the correct label. Now that we have split our dataset into a training and testing subset, we will loop through the training subset to train our Recurrent Neural Network. We will start the loop by building the Recurrent Neural Network we will use for this tutorial. The recurrent layer in our network will have 128 units. The output layer will have a single unit since we are trying to predict the next word in the sequence. In addition to our RNN layer, we will also have a dense layer. The dense layer will have a single unit to match the output layer. We will use a rectifier activation function on the output of the dense layer. To train our network, we will use the fit method on our model. We will pass our training subset as the x"

Long-time president Alexander Lukashenko won 80 percent of the vote, extending his 26-year long rule in the former Soviet republic. About 5,000 people gathered in the capital, Minsk, to protest the election results. Lukashenko won 80 percent of the vote, the electoral commission said. That result is unlikely to be challenged in court. Protesters chanted ""Down with Lukashenko!"" and ""Russia, Russia!"" as they marched through the capital's Independence Square. Some carried signs reading ""Russia, our brotherland"" and ""Down with Belarusian capitalism."" Opposition leader Pavel Grudinin says 80 percent of the people in the country have no faith in the vote. Grudinin is the only person running against Lukashenko, who is running for a third term. He says the electoral commission's result is a ""conspiracy."" Russia's state-run news agency RIA-Novosti reported that the Russian embassy in Minsk has condemned the results. RIA-Novosti quoted a statement by the embassy as saying that ""Russian citizens in Belarus are being subjected to undemocratic methods of election rigging."" The protests came a day after a court in Minsk ruled that a candidate in the presidential race could not register to run. He said he was barred from running because he does not have a criminal record."
LLAMA,tldr-14,"Thousands of people protested in Belarus on the weekend over the results of the presidential election. Long-time president Alexander Lukashenko won 80 percent of the vote, extending his 26-year long rule. Lukashenko is often called Europe's last dictator. He's known for his brutal crackdowns on protesters and the free press, as well as for what human rights advocates have called ""disappearances"" of political opponents. Today, you'll hear from one of the people who protested in the country's capital, Minsk, this weekend. She's a 25-year-old journalist named Maryna. She spoke with The World's Carol Hills on the line from Minsk. We're not using her last name to protect her identity. ""I was in the very center of Minsk in one of the central squares. And the square was surrounded by the police, so we couldn't go anywhere. But there were some people, they were really brave, who tried to get out of the square and they were attacked by the police and were detained. ""I think the election was not free and fair. The results - people are not really happy with the results of the election. The turnout was quite high, but I think it was because they were forced to vote. The public sector workers were forced to vote. ""Most of them were detained for 15 days. Some of them are still kept in jail. I've heard that some of them are beaten, but I can't say anything for sure because I'm not in prison. I'm just following the news and trying to find information about my friends. ""I'm not afraid because I've been on the streets for five days already, and I'm not afraid. And I know that if I'm detained, I will be released. And if not, I'm ready to stay in jail for 15 days and I'm ready to pay the fine. And I'm ready to do it for my country and for our freedom. ""I don't think that it's a matter of time that Lukashenko will go away because I don't think he wants to go away. He really wants to stay in power. And he doesn't care about the people and what they want. He just wants to stay in power. And he's ready to do anything to stay in power. And he's ready to kill people. He's ready to suppress any protests, any actions. ""Of course, it's not safe to live here, especially if you're a journalist. It's not safe to live here if you're a political activist. And it's not safe to live here if you're just a normal person and you want to live free. You don't want to be afraid of police and you want to be able to say what you think.

LLAMA,tldr-15,"This article describes a vulnerability within iCloud Sharing and Safari 15 that allowed hackers to gain unauthorized camera access on Macs. It details how the vulnerability was discovered and how it was reported to Apple, and how Apple responded. Security researcher Sabri Haddouche recently discovered a vulnerability in Safari 15 that allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to a user's Mac webcam. The exploit would have allowed malicious actors to activate and view the webcam of a user's Mac, all without their knowledge or permission. Sabri Haddouche found the bug in the iCloud Sharing feature in Safari 15. This feature is designed to allow users to share links and webpages from Safari. The vulnerability he found allowed him to replace the shared iCloud web page with a video stream from the user's webcam. This would allow hackers to view the user's webcam feed without their knowledge or permission. Haddouche responsibly reported the vulnerability to Apple, as per Apple's security policy. The policy states that Apple will not pursue legal action against anyone who reports a bug within Apple software, provided that the individual is not maliciously using the bug. Apple responded quickly to Haddouche's report, and released a patch within 10 days to fix the bug. As of now, Apple has fixed this issue, and released the patch to all users. While the vulnerability was discovered and fixed quickly, it is important to remember that Apple products are not immune to vulnerabilities. As Macs become more popular in the enterprise, so too do the risks associated with them. In order to mitigate risk in the enterprise, it is important to not only use a solution that manages macOS, but also one that supports other operating systems.

RediSQL can be used as a cache for the data in your MySQL database. The data that is accessed most frequently is placed in RediSQL, and this data is retrieved when the user accesses the database. The other data remains in MySQL, which is much better at storing large quantities of data. You can also use RediSQL as a database by itself. You can use it as a data store for a temporary file that will be deleted within a short time, for example. In this guide, we will show you how to set up RediSQL on your Ubuntu 16.04 server. You can find these packages in the Ubuntu repositories. First, we will make sure that there are no other Redis instances running on your system. Then, we will start the Redis server. After the server is up and running, we will install the RediSQL extension. Next, we will set up the RediSQL database. Now that RediSQL is up and running, we will create a table called products to store the products in our online store. You can insert data into the products table using the SQL INSERT command. You can also read the data from the table using the SELECT statement. You can also delete a row in the table using the DELETE statement. In this guide, we have shown you how to set up RediSQL on an Ubuntu 16.04 server. RediSQL is an in-memory database that is easy to use and install.

Sign up for a free Mux account and get started with a 20 credit towards your first month! Start by importing the Mux Python SDK into your project. Mux provides a number of methods for getting data from your project. In this example, we'll be using the Mux API to get a list of all the videos that the user has watched over the past 12 months. The getevents method will return a list of all events for the past 12 months. In this example, we're only interested in the videoplay events, which we can specify by passing a query parameter of typevideoplay to the method. We can also specify a timeframe of the past 12 months using the since and until parameters. Now that we have a list of videoplay events, we can extract some useful information. Now that we have a list of video IDs, we can use the getvideo method to get data about the video itself. The getvideo method will return a dictionary that contains information like the title, description, and thumbnail. To be more concise, we can also write the code above as a one-liner. Now that we have the video title, we can loop through the list of video IDs and print out the title for each video. Now that we have the list of videos, let's count the total number of plays across all videos. We can count the total number of plays using the groupby method. This method will return a dictionary that contains the number of plays grouped by the videoid. Now we'll create a graph that shows the total number of video plays over the course of the past 12 months. To create the graph, we'll use the sum of the number of plays as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. The getevents method will return a list of events, where each event is a dictionary. The event dictionary contains the timestamp of the event, the videoid, and the amount of time the video was watched. We can loop through the event list to find the number of plays for each day in the past 12 months. Now we'll plot the data on a graph. To generate the graph, we'll use the plotly library, which provides a number of useful plotting methods. We can use the graphobjs method to create an array of trace objects, which contain the information for each data series. The graphobjs method takes the x-axis and y-axis data as parameters. Since we're plotting the number of plays over the past 12 months, the x-axis will contain the day of each month. We can use the datetime module to get the first day of each month. Since we're plotting the number of plays on the y-axis, we'll use the sum of the plays for each day. Now we can use the plotly library to generate the graph. The graph object will contain the data for the graph. We can use the createdict method to turn the graph object into a dictionary. We can then convert the dictionary into JSON and embed it in our HTML template. Now let's build a graph that shows the average amount of time the user spent watching videos. To create the graph, we'll use the sum of the time watched as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. To get the total time watched across all videos, we'll use the sum of the playtime property from each event dictionary. Now we can build the graph using the same method as before. Once again, we can embed the JSON data into our HTML template. Now let's build a graph that shows the total number of unique videos watched. To create the graph, we'll use the count of unique video IDs as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. The first step is to get a list of all the unique video IDs.

OpenAI,tldr-18,"Follow this step by step guide with working code examples to build a ""Spotify Wrapped"" clone using Mux's Data API. Sure! Here's a step by step guide on how to build a Spotify Wrapped clone using Mux's Data API: 1. First, you'll need to create an account with Mux and get an API token. You can do this by navigating to the Mux website and following the instructions provided. 2. Next, you'll need to authenticate your requests to the Mux API using your API token. You can do this by including your token in the headers of your HTTP requests. 3. Once you've authenticated your requests, you can start making requests to the Mux Data API to retrieve data about a user's Spotify listening history. You can retrieve this data using the 'analyticsv1' endpoint. 4. After retrieving the user's listening history, you'll need to parse the data and aggregate it to create meaningful insights about their listening habits. For example, you could calculate the user's most listened to artists, songs, albums, and genres. 5. Once you've aggregated the user's listening data, you can use a front-end framework like React or Vue to display the insights in a visually appealing way. You could create charts, tables, or graphs to help the user visualize their listening habits. 6. Finally, you'll need to deploy your application to a web server like Heroku or Netlify so that other users can access it. Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to authenticate your requests to the Mux API using your API token: "" ' import requests apitoken 'your-api-token' headers Authorization': f'Bearer {apitoken response requests.get headersheaders) print (response.json "" ' This code example sends a GET request to the 'analyticsv1' endpoint of the Mux Data API with an 'Authorization' header that includes your API token. The 'response.json ' line of code extracts the JSON data from the response object and prints it to the console. Good luck with your project! Let me know if you need any further assistance."

Rolls Royce worked with the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the National Health Service to develop the technology. It uses AI and machine learning to analyze a patient's speech patterns and habits, then translate those patterns into written and spoken words. The tool will be made available to patients through the NHS and MND Association. It will be available to anyone with a diagnosis of MND. People with the disease will be able to create their own speech profile and then use it to help them communicate. Dr. Susie Henley, Head of Healthcare Innovation at the MND Association, said, ""This breakthrough has the potential to transform the lives of people living with the disease who cannot move their arms or hands. It could mean they are able to communicate with their loved ones for the first time in many years."""

Is HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) Right For Me? HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a widely adopted streaming protocol used by many popular online video platforms like YouTube and Facebook. It's the most popular streaming format today. HLS has many advantages and is an ideal choice for streaming live video. However, it's not without some shortcomings, and not all use cases are ideal for it. In this article, we'll go over what HLS is, the pros and cons of HLS, and some use cases that are ideal for using HLS. When To Use HLS What Is HLS? HLS is a streaming protocol created by Apple that delivers video content over HTTP. It's a protocol for breaking a single video into a sequence of small HTTP-based video files. This makes it easier to deliver video content over the Internet, and allows the video to adapt to changing network conditions without stopping and restarting. When To Use HLS Live Streaming HLS has many advantages and is an ideal choice for streaming live video to most audiences. There are a few scenarios where you should consider using a different streaming protocol. Do Not Use HLS For Live Streams That Require Low Latency For some use cases, latency matters more than compatibility. Low-latency live streams are essential for use cases where you need to avoid significant delays between the live event and the live stream. The best use case for low-latency live streaming is broadcasting live sports online. The lower the latency, the more enjoyable the viewing experience. With high latency, you'll see viewers complaining in the chat and on social media about the stream being behind. HLS is not ideal for low-latency live streaming because HLS live streams have 30-40 seconds of latency. HLS streams use a technique called segmented streaming. This requires the encoder to wait to receive a segment of video before starting to stream it. HLS Live Streaming Latency In comparison, RTMP has about 3-7 seconds of latency, and RTSP has about 2 seconds of latency. If low latency is essential for your live stream, consider using a different streaming protocol such as RTMP, RTSP, or WebRTC. Do Not Use HLS For Live Streams That Require On-Demand Playback If you need to record your live stream for on-demand viewing, consider using a streaming protocol other than HLS. HLS was not designed with on-demand playback in mind. There are a few reasons for this: HLS supports adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR), but it's up to the client to choose which bitrate to use when playing back the stream. This makes it harder to use adaptive bitrate for on-demand playback. HLS segments are downloaded in a random order, so there is no way to know what bitrate to use to download the segments that come next. HLS segments are downloaded in parallel. This works great for live streams, but it's not ideal for on-demand playback. When you use HLS for on-demand playback, there will be gaps in the playback, and the stream will stop and start while waiting for segments to download. If on-demand playback is important to you, consider using a different streaming protocol. RTMP is best suited for this. Do Not Use HLS For Mobile Live Streams When you use HLS to stream to mobile devices, you must use a different method to play the stream. On iOS and Android devices, you can use HTML5 video tag with the src attribute set to the HLS stream URL. However, the HLS playback experience on mobile is not ideal. HLS playback on mobile devices has high latency and is not reliable. This is caused by mobile network instability. When the mobile network is unstable, HLS segments may not be downloaded properly. This results in playback stalls and interruptions. If you plan to stream to mobile devices, consider using a different streaming protocol like RTMP, RTSP, or WebRTC. When To Use HLS Live Streaming HLS has many advantages and is ideal for streaming live video to most audiences. HLS Is The Most Popular Streaming Format HLS is the most popular streaming format.

LLAMA,tldr-24,"Large and mysterious land carvings have been discovered in India's Thar Desert. The geoglyphs may be the largest-ever graphical depictions designed by humans. They were discovered using Google Earth during an investigation into the possibility of finding ancient remains in the area. The carvings were first discovered in 2012 by a group of Indian researchers led by Rohan Rawat, who was an Indian student at the time. Rohan discovered the carvings after a project to map and survey the region using Google Earth. After finding the images, he contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for further research. The researchers and ISRO then went to the region, and found that the carvings were depicted using small rocks and boulders that had been laid out in patterns over the ground. The rocks are not aligned with the ground, but are rather laid out to give the appearance of the design from an aerial perspective. The researchers found that the carvings were created by piling up small rocks, which would have required a massive amount of work. Researchers at the time estimated that it would have taken 1800 hours of labor to create one of the carvings. The carvings depict ancient gods, goddesses, and animals. The carvings were created by a group of people called the Indus Valley Civilization, which was the largest ancient civilization in India. The civilization existed from 3300 BC to 1300 BC. The images are difficult to see from the ground, which may be why they have not been discovered earlier. The carvings are created by placing rocks on the ground in various patterns. The carvings are so large that the entire depiction can only be seen from an aerial perspective. The carvings are a mystery to researchers, and it is not clear why the Indus Valley civilization created them. The carvings are located in the Thar Desert, which is one of the least hospitable places on earth, making it unlikely that the carvings were created for practical purposes. Many of the carvings depict animals and gods, which suggests that they may have been used for ceremonial purposes. Researchers also note that some of the carvings are located near roads and land routes that may have been used for trade. More carvings are expected to be found in the area as further research is carried out. The carvings are one of the oldest forms of graphical representation made by humans, and they demonstrate the complexity of the Indus Valley civilization."

The data was then overlaid on a map of the area, which showed that the arrow points to a pair of figures that are about 150ft (45 metres) long. Closer inspection of the two figures reveals that they are not ordinary road signs, but rather geometric designs, measuring about 30ft (10 metres) in height and width. The researchers believe that the figures were probably made by a team of masons, who worked in teams of four. The geometry of the figures suggests that the artists had access to the location of the sun and the moon, and also the position of the stars. This means that the art could have been used to calculate the position of the planets. The scientists believe that the figures were probably made by a team of masons, who worked in teams of four. The geometry of the figures suggests that the artists had access to the location of the sun and the moon, and also the position of the stars. This means that the art could have been used to calculate the position of the planets (stock image) But the idea that the ancient civilisation had advanced astronomical knowledge has also been dismissed. Astronomer Greg Seidel, from the University of New Mexico, told The Telegraph: 'The idea that these figures represent the positions of planets is a bit of a stretch.' Instead, the figures could have been a tool for the civilisation's priests and astronomers to predict the seasons. The theory is supported by the fact that the masons created the designs in the year 2000 BC, when the Indian summer was known to be the hottest time of the year. But the exact purpose of the 300-year-old artworks remains a mystery. Astronomer Greg Seidel, from the University of New Mexico, told The Telegraph: 'The idea that these figures represent the positions of planets is a bit of a stretch.'"

Human,tldr-24,Large and mysterious land carvings have been discovered in India's Thar Desert. The geoglyphs may be the largest-ever graphical depictions designed by humans. They were discovered using Google Earth during a virtual survey of the region. The lines that make up the design are up to 10 centimeters deep and spread 20 to 50 centimeters wide. The largest geoglyph is made from a single looping line that runs for 12 kilometers. Another shape is composed of an 11-kilometer-long line. It is unclear what the meaning or function of the design is. The design is estimated to be at least 150 years old.

Tsinghua,tldr-25,"Luna allows developers to design, prototype, develop, and refactor any application by linking visual elements together. Developers are able to collaborate with a team, interactively fine-tune parameters, inspect the results, and iterate in real-time. As we continue to evolve our software, Luna continues to grow as well. We have launched a new version of Luna today that includes many improvements including new data visualizations, new animation types, and an improved version of our Luna Labs testing suite. Luna 3.0 introduces a new test suite, called Luna Labs. It provides developers a suite of tests to validate a user's experience, while eliminating the need to build, deploy, and manage external infrastructure. Luna Labs is fully integrated with Luna, allowing developers to test Luna and other applications without changing code. Luna Labs includes integration with major tools such as SiteMeter, Google Analytics, and Twitter. Additionally, Luna Labs supports integration with other Xamarin applications, such as MonoTouch and MonoDroid. Xamarin.Forms Luna introduces Xamarin.Forms for the first time. Xamarin.Forms is an open source library of controls, layout, and behaviors for building native-looking cross-platform mobile and desktop apps with JavaScript. We have included Xamarin.Forms to help simplify and speed up development by allowing developers to leverage the same familiar controls and techniques used to build web apps. For example, Xamarin.Forms includes controls for displaying data in a grid or table, and drag and drop UI components for layout, color, font, and other options. These controls provide a standard set of behaviors and behaviors that work across all platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows, and web. Xamarin.Forms provides a solid foundation for building cross-platform mobile apps. For more information on Xamarin.Forms, please visit: Additional Improvements New data visualizations allow developers to see the impact of changes made to data without reloading the application. The new data visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, and table views. Additionally, new animations allow developers to easily make transitions between states in their applications. Developers can also make use of animation types that allow them to animate their applications based on user interactions. With the new animations, developers can use effects such as fading in and out or moving between states with smooth animations. We have also made it easier to see the state of a control. We have added a new inspector that allows developers to see the state of their controls at a glance. For example, developers can see the state of the selected item in a ListBox or the current selection in a ComboBox. Xamarin.Forms users can take advantage of a new property that provides a strong, typed reference to the view that was just added to the UI. This allows developers to quickly access a view after adding it to the UI. We have also improved the process of adding controls to the view. Previously, adding controls to the view required a developer to set the DataContext and set the Visibility of the control to be visible. Now, a developer can simply add a control to the view and the view will automatically set the visibility of the control. Xamarin.Forms developers can also make use of new APIs to get the content of the control and to set the content of the control. The new APIs allow developers to set the content of the control and retrieve the content of the control. Additionally, we have updated the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package to include a newer version of the ReactiveUI library. ReactiveUI provides an elegant and intuitive approach to managing the state of your UI. ReactiveUI provides you with the flexibility to define your own behavior and provide it to the view, so that the view knows how to react to your state changes."

LLAMA,tldr-26,"SVGs have become popular due to their scalability, flexibility, and how lightweight they are. This article takes a look at SVG techniques such as SVG grids, fractional SVG stars, masks, and animation. SVG is no longer just a way to put pretty vector graphics on your website, with most modern browsers supporting all of SVG's advanced features, it has become a tool that can be used to create web pages that are beautiful, usable, performant, and accessible. In this article, we are going to look at some of the latest SVG techniques that we can use to push SVGs to their limits. Let's start by looking at SVG grids. It is important that we design for different screen sizes, so if we are using SVGs as background images, it is important that we design the SVG to scale with different viewports. I am going to start by creating a simple grid SVG in Sketch using the rectangle tool. Once I have my rectangles, I am going to export them as an SVG. The SVG will be exported with a viewBox that defines the aspect ratio of the SVG. The SVG will scale if the viewBox is changed, so if we want to change the aspect ratio, we need to change the viewBox. To make sure the SVG scales with the viewport, we need to make sure that we remove the viewBox. SVGs have a lot of advanced features such as masks, clipping paths, filters, and more. A lot of these features can be combined to create advanced effects. Let's take a look at some examples. SVGs can be clipped to different shapes, making them only visible in the clipped areas. Let's say we want to add a circle in the middle of our image. We can use a clipPath to clip our image to a circle. It is also possible to clip multiple elements to different shapes. SVGs can also have text applied to them. SVG text has a lot of different features, such as fonts, alignment, and justification. If we want our text to be only visible in a certain area, we can use a mask to only show the text in that area. You can also have an SVG with multiple masks. With some CSS, we can change the text to make it more readable. There are many filters that we can apply to an SVG. Let's take a look at some examples. SVGs are also very useful for creating interesting overlays. We can use SVGs to create a circle. SVGs can also be used to create interesting shapes. We can use a path to create a star. These stars can then be animated using CSS. SVGs are also useful for creating animations that are lightweight and performant. We can create animations by adding more paths to the SVG. The animation can then be triggered by adding a class to the SVG. SVGs are a great tool for creating performant and scalable websites. They can be used for creating background images and overlays, and can be used to create beautiful animations."

If you haven't already, head over to SvelteKit.com to sign up for the beta. SvelteKit brings the Svelte compile-time execution model to the server. In Svelte, you write your application's logic in JS. That code is then compiled to a set of plain HTML and CSS, ready to be shipped to the browser. Because the code is compiled, Svelte is able to perform a lot of optimizations. For example, if a component isn't being used on the page, Svelte is able to omit it completely. SvelteKit takes the same approach on the server. It parses your JS files, extracts the logic, and renders the result into HTML. Because SvelteKit knows exactly what the browser will need, it can optimize the server-rendered output to keep it as lightweight as possible. With server-side rendering, your web app can start rendering immediately, before the JS is downloaded and executed. This reduces the initial load time, and makes your app feel faster and more responsive. SvelteKit automatically generates bundles for your JS and CSS, including all the code your page needs to work offline. This means you don't have to manually split your code into different files. You can simply write your app as if it were a single page app. The bundles are also automatically code-split. SvelteKit will only load the code that the browser needs to render the current page. Code-splitting is important because it helps to reduce the amount of data that has to be transferred to the browser. It also makes the initial load faster, and means the browser can start executing your code sooner. Routing lets you build multiple pages using the same codebase. This lets you share code across different parts of your app, while keeping each page focused on a specific task. SvelteKit also works great for single page apps. The only difference is that all of your code is always loaded. This means there's no need for code-splitting. SvelteKit works with existing web frameworks, like Express.js. You can simply wrap your existing app with SvelteKit to take advantage of its features. If you're building a new app, or you're using a simpler framework like Koa.js, you can use the SvelteKit app generator to scaffold a new project. SvelteKit is designed to work with serverless platforms like Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify, Zeit Now, or Webtask. SvelteKit adaptors make it easy to deploy your app to these platforms. They will build your app, minify and bundle your code, and upload it to your serverless provider. SvelteKit can also work with traditional web servers. This is useful if you're deploying to a platform that doesn't support serverless (e.g. AWS S3) or you prefer to control your own web server. To deploy to a traditional server, simply configure your web server to serve the correct files. You can find the file structure and instructions in the SvelteKit docs. If you're interested in trying SvelteKit, sign up for the beta on SvelteKit.com. The beta includes a code editor, compiler, and tutorial. It also includes documentation for getting started with the SvelteKit CLI and running SvelteKit on different serverless platforms. To get started, sign up for the beta, then run the sveltekit tutorial command to install the CLI and start the tutorial. Because SvelteKit is still in beta, you'll need to install it locally. It will be released publicly as soon as it's ready. You can also find the SvelteKit beta on GitHub.

BigScience,tldr-30,"A team of scientists launched a box containing four types of bacteria and fungus into the stratosphere to expose them to several hours of Mars-like conditions. The experiment found that each species survived, but some suffered damage from being exposed to high temperatures. The goal was to find out how long organisms would survive when subjected to similar conditions as those on another planet for around an hour or so. ""As we think about colonizing other worlds in space or deep inside our bodies and even more closely related environments like groundwater reservoirs, this kind of information is critical,"" said Peter Crutzen, professor at UCLA's Department of Earth and Space Science who led the study which appears today in a scientific journal Nature Geoscience. ""The question now is: What can you do if there are no life-supporting molecules? Can it work without a lot of added carbon dioxide? We know that microbes have evolved over billions of years with very different lifestyles - most living under water where oxygen does not exist much after its creation by volcanic activity. But sometimes they also live in surface rocks. To see what could happen here, we decided to put all these creatures together and observe their behavior,"" he explained. These microorganisms were selected because they already inhabit many natural niches packed full of nutrients such as soil or rocky floors in underground water wells: Bacteria forms a network of filaments known as biofilms composed of thousands of tiny cells (called cocci) trapped within extracellular polymeric substances;"

Researchers at the Salk Institute and the University of California San Diego have genetically modified the animals so that they light up when neurons are activated. This allows researchers to see the neural activity of the jellyfish as they swim around, mate, and search for food. The findings were published in the journal Nature Methods. This is an incredible advance, as the light activation of neurons is far more sensitive and specific than other techniques, such as calcium imaging. The new technique is extremely sensitive, and the scientists are able to see neural activity in single neurons. This could help us to better understand how different neural circuits work, as well as help us to better understand diseases that cause changes in neural circuits, such as autism, depression, and schizophrenia. In this case, the researchers have been able to use the jellyfish to study a neural circuit that controls the rhythmic motion of the animal's body. This circuit is used to move the jellyfish, and researchers have found that it is involved in some mental disorders. ""These circuits are very important for animal locomotion,"" said researcher Dr. William Schwab, the principle investigator of the study. ""The work has been highly anticipated by neuroscientists and we are very excited to see the results."" The research could also help us to understand how certain drugs and chemicals can affect the neural activity of the animal. ""These new tools will allow us to ask questions that have been vexing neuroscientists for decades,"" said Dr. Schwab. ""They have the potential to fundamentally change the way we study neural circuits and behaviors in vertebrates, and we are very excited about their applications."""

Jellyfish are found in just about every ocean, but they don't form large schools like other types do instead individuals swim together for short periods before moving on again.""This is really important work,"" says Michael Dickinson, a neuroscientist at Boston University who was not involved with these studies.The authors show how well this works and highlight its potential uses by testing responses during escape behaviors such those elicited from predators or competitors"" he tells Science. ""Although I am always skeptical because we could never prove what neuron X responded too without somehow destroying function (which would eliminate any chance you had even knowing which cell gave off signals), [this paper] adds some very nice evidence here showing where groups respond differently than isolated animals...and then links particular cells back through behavioral experiments making me believe there's something worth looking into further down an experimental roadmap."

Floods are an annual occurrence around the world, but some areas in particular suffer from severe flooding and loss of life on a regular basis due to unstable soils or inadequate drainage systems. The first step is to check your home's foundation to see if there has been any damage caused by heavy rain or strong winds following hurricanes. If you live near waterways such as rivers, streams, lakes, creeks or ponds make sure they aren't encroaching into your property causing structural problems at home. Flooding can also occur from direct rainfall because of building defects like low-quality construction materials used during renovations or leaky pipes left unrepaired over time."

""If you know you can save at least one person, at least save that one. Save the one in the car,"" Johann Jungwirth, chief digital officer of Daimler AG, told Car and Driver. ""If all you know for sure is that one death can be prevented, then that's your first priority."" While this may not sound that bad, it does create a bit of an issue. For example, if there were a bus full of children in the middle of the road and a driverless Mercedes Benz was heading towards the bus, the car would be programmed to swerve out of the way and hit a tree in order to protect the driver. It seems as if Mercedes Benz has already made the decision, and it seems as if it has decided to save the driver over pedestrians. While that is a bit more selfish than other options, it is hard to argue with the logic. There have been a number of accidents where cars have flipped over and caused injuries to other passengers as well as pedestrians. By making the choice to save the driver, Mercedes Benz is making the decision to save the one who is most likely to survive. Autonomous cars are still a few years away from being released, but it will be interesting to see how other manufacturers decide to program their driverless cars.

LLAMA,tldr-35,"Droidlet is a platform for building intelligent agents that simplifies integrating a wide range of machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid prototyping. It can be used to quickly test out new ideas or build a fully fledged agent. An agent is a program that acts in an environment. It can perceive the environment and act upon it. The actions can be as simple as moving to a different location or as complex as playing a board game. We think of an agent as a brain in a robot. This brain can be used in many different robots, from a little robot in a computer game to a real robot in the real world. The brain can be connected to the robot's sensors and actuators and thus observe its environment and act upon it. Droidlet aims to provide a platform for creating intelligent agents that is easy to use and allows for rapid prototyping. Droidlet is inspired by and based on the OpenAI Gym framework. Droidlet consists of the following components: The environment is a module that simulates a robot's sensors and actuators. An agent is a module that implements a controller for the environment. It observes the environment through the sensors and acts upon it through the actuators. A task is a module that controls the environment and the agent. It provides a goal for the agent and evaluates its performance. To help you get started we provide several sample environments, agents and tasks. The samples are available from the droidlet-samples repository. Please note that the documentation in this repository is incomplete and outdated. For more information, see the full documentation. To help you get started we provide the following tutorials: Tutorial 1: Introduction to Droidlet Tutorial 2: Reinforcement Learning with Droidlet Tutorial 3: Neural Networks with Droidlet We provide a number of sample agents. Each sample is in its own repository and includes a README with an explanation of how the sample works. To get started, clone the sample repository and read the README. Many of the samples include a unit test that will be run automatically by Travis CI when you push a new commit. If you are interested in contributing to the samples, we recommend that you start with one of these samples. Droidlet is written in Python 3.6 and makes use of the following packages: numpy (v1.14.5) six (v1.10.0) requests (v2.18.4) gym (v0.8.0) joblib (v0.11.0) pygame (v1.9.5) colorama (v0.4.1) All modules are available as PyPI packages and can be installed with pip. If you want to run the unit tests you will also need to install pytest. To run Droidlet from a virtualenv, activate the environment and then run one of the following commands: python -m droidlet.examples.tutorials.tutorial1 This will run the first tutorial, a simple example of reinforcement learning. You can run the individual agents using: python -m droidlet.agents.agent1 This will run the first agent, a simple agent that moves around in the environment and avoids walls. You can run the individual tasks using: python -m droidlet.tasks.task1 This will run the first task, a simple task in which the agent is rewarded for moving to the center of the environment.

BigScience,tldr-35,"Droidlet is a platform for building intelligent agents that simplifies integrating a wide range of machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid prototyping. It can be used to quickly test out agent applications in the real world and produce useful results. The main components of Droidlets are the development environment, code generators (we use TensorFlow), optimizers (we use Caffe) and a set of APIs to control their execution. Each component has an open-source project on GitHub: Tensorflow: The framework we have chosen uses deep neural networks called convolutional autoencoders with custom extensions. They add semantic information by training them directly from image data without using any previous knowledge about what they represent or how they look like -this makes them very powerful at capturing complex patterns such as faces. Caffe: This library provides a Python API to build CNN models mainly designed to accelerate training processes. We also rely on it when implementing our own model structures; the advantage here being its ability to scale well across different GPU architectures. What sets Caffe apart is its features-based implementation which allows you to define specific functions within your network structure instead of limiting yourself only to predefined types (i.e., inputs, filters). ImageNet pre-trained models: For this work, we leverage several ImageNet datasets including Resnet-50 [1], VGG-16 [2] and Inception v3 [3]. These large-scale classification tasks require millions of images representing thousands of classes over one billion labeled pixels. To generate all these required annotations, researchers resorted to crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk [4]. II. PROPOSED APPROACH A. Overview Proposed Model Structure Our approach aims at modeling facial expressions as one continuous stream representation allowing us to capture several subtle variations through time frames while handling noise robustly during inference. Using multiple smaller streams improves generalization capabilities but would constrain our overall frame rate limit since each resolution captures fewer details than its higher-resolution counterpart. Therefore, having a single compact representation seems more appropriate especially given that raw RGB video streaming rates today exceed 1GBps [5]. Moreover, most problems involving facial expression recognition typically focus on classifying discrete categories rather than finding subtle changes between consecutive frames [6]; notably the latter becomes crucial when dealing with short sequences where many non-facial movements occur. To achieve both requirements simultaneously, we propose a hybrid extension based on a multi-stage recurrent architecture inspired from LSTM [7], [8] and GRU [9] units along with two other techniques proposed recently [10], [11]. (see Figure 2) B. Hybrid Recurrent Networks Common advances include stacked asynchronous actor-critic [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] methods which allow faster convergence thanks to better approximations. However, for convenience sake, those approaches do not lend themselves easily to generalization via end-to-end trainable parameterizations. In recent years, some works tried to combine asynchronous dynamics in RNNs such as Wang et al. who introduced so called Deep Gated Graph Neural Networks: DG-GANs [11]. Their architecture consists of three basic modules: A Generator module composed of multiple ""mini-GANs"" acting independently on each input sample; Batch Normalisation layers to improve prediction accuracy; Finally, another generator combining predictions coming from minigans outputs. However, although promising, this method requires a lot of hand-crafted hyperparameters which might lead to unsatisfactory performance depending on the problem domain considered. More importantly, it involves matrix multiplications whose computational complexity increases with increasing number of samples. To address those issues, we first introduce a new type of gating mechanism inside recurrent architectures known as shared memory gates defined as: where denotes a non-linear function such as tanh, sigmoid etc.. During forward propagation, we replace delays computationally expensive matrix multiplication operations with simple scalar products between corresponding elements according to: with t the current state value... Gates will determine whether residual connection should be computed after every non-shared element or left blank (this corresponds to uninterrupted communication channels). Our second contribution comes from introducing sparse connections similar to a variational Auto Encoder (VAE) concept pioneered by Kingma et al. in order to reduce dimensionality whilst preserving reconstruction quality: where m nn stands for the parameters describing the rectifier linear unit activation: Often modelled by ReLU (rectified linear activation function) f rlu (x) max{0, x}, it guarantees zero derivative discontinuity: x 0 f rlu (x) max{0}. Finally, we suggest replacing traditional temporal attention mechanisms often employed with (dynamic) dropout technique [1011]. Instead, we design a novel form of dynamic weight sharing akin to so-called Kronecker product operation commonly seen in tensor algebra.

Facebook has officially released its desktop redesign which features a dark mode, a tabbed home screen, and a cleaner profile. Users can now start to opt-in to the new design. It's been a few years since Facebook made a major desktop redesign. Back in 2013, Facebook made its site dark mode and tabbed home screen options available to users who wanted them. Today, Facebook has officially released its desktop redesign which features a dark mode, a tabbed home screen, and a cleaner profile. Facebook is rolling out the new desktop redesign to a small number of users in the US, UK, Australia, and India. Facebook says that the redesign will be available to all users in ""the coming weeks."" To opt-in to the redesign, head to the Settings menu in the upper right of the Facebook homepage. Scroll down to the ""Appearance"" section, and click the ""Dark Mode"" toggle. Facebook will prompt you to update your desktop version of Facebook to the latest version, which will enable the new desktop redesign. The new desktop redesign is now available for Android and iOS. For Android, head to Settings Facebook Appearance and click the ""Dark Mode"" toggle. For iOS, head to Settings Facebook Appearance and click the ""Dark Mode"" toggle. Facebook's mobile apps have had a dark mode for years, but this is the first time the company has offered a dark mode for desktop. The redesigned profile is cleaner, with a smaller background image, and Facebook is also introducing tabbed home screens. The tabbed home screen will allow users to switch between their Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook Lite accounts in a single click. The redesign also introduces the ability to change your Facebook profile picture, and Facebook is now introducing a ""Home Feed"" button in the lower right of the Facebook homepage. Home Feed will now show your Facebook posts and Instagram photos in a carousel. Facebook has been under pressure from advertisers, investors, and regulators to make its site easier to use, and less intrusive."

The update is available for all Facebook users in 20 languages currently via app store or directly on their mobile device settings page - although it's not clear when it will be rolled out across Europe yet (perhaps we'll have more clarity around that soon). ""We want our friends' feeds to reflect who they are right now, but also what inspires them at any moment - both of these become easier with this updated experience,"" said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and cofounder of Facebook. While there's no word as to whether Facebook was influenced by Instagram's recent move towards using an alternate color scheme instead of white, it does make sense since the social media giant utilizes similar innovations like the use of different background colors based on time of day. This change could prove beneficial for brands looking to get more engagement from their audience; people naturally gravitate toward clutter-free sites due to how much more attention-grabbing content tends to stand out compared to less sparse layouts. The changes should help keep your brand consistent across platforms while capitalizing on digital trends without compromising quality standards.

Tsinghua,tldr-39,"Scientists have developed a new gene-editing tool that is more accurate than CRISPR-Cas9. Prime editing can mend about 89 percent of the 75,000 or so harmful mutations in the human genome, researchers say. The new gene-editing tool has higher precision and efficiency than CRISPR-Cas9. It could lead to more precise gene-editing treatments and treatments for people with cancer, Huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis and other genetic diseases. Prime editing is a variant of the Cas9 protein that can edit the genome without causing unwanted changes. The technique can also be used to correct the effects of inherited diseases. The tool, which is under development by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, has already been tested on the gene that causes sickle cell anemia in mice. The team, led by Joseph Sanberg, a professor of molecular medicine and pathology, and Alex Tabrizi, a professor of molecular and cellular biology, are the first to develop a gene-editing tool that has been shown to correct the effects of an inherited disease in animals. They hope to eventually use the tool to correct genetic mutations in people with inherited diseases. Sanberg said their new gene-editing tool is more precise and efficient than CRISPR-Cas9. It could lead to more precise gene-editing treatments and treatments for people with cancer, Huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis and other genetic diseases. ""The ability to correct diseases like sickle cell anemia, which are caused by inherited mutations, is going to be extremely important in the future,"" Sanberg said. ""We think that the use of this new tool will allow us to use the same approach for a variety of inherited diseases."" The researchers first removed a DNA fragment from the sickle cell gene in mice, replacing it with a DNA fragment from healthy mice. The DNA fragment contained a mutation that corrected the effects of the sickle cell mutation in the mouse genome. The team then used Prime editing to edit the DNA fragment back into the mouse genome, making sure the DNA fragment was fully functional. When the mice were injected with the virus that carried the DNA fragment, the correction of the sickle cell gene was nearly 100 percent effective, the researchers reported. ""This tool is not only more precise than CRISPR-Cas9, but it's also more efficient,"" Tabrizi said. ""We think that this tool will be very useful for treating diseases caused by mutations, especially diseases like sickle cell anemia."" Sanberg said his team is working to refine the technique, but he thinks it will soon be ready for clinical trials. ""The first phase of the clinical trial will be testing it in a mouse model,"" he said. ""That's a really important step, because it shows that we can work with human cells to correct a disease in mice. ""In the next phase, we will test it in people with sickle cell anemia."

Trello has been used as an online board game since its inception more than 20 years ago but it's also come to be associated with project management - particularly lean production initiatives like Lean Six Sigma, which are aimed at optimising processes. It may sound strange considering SketchUp Builder is not even a full-fledged 3D drawing tool... Yet there seems no doubt that this feature could prove very useful for those using the design platform on-the-go and who don't want to carry around heavy CAD tools. SketchUp builds many models directly into Trello including 2D drawings, floor plans, perspective views, elevation profiles etc. Not only these resources are visible within each task, but they're linked via tagging functions making them accessible throughout different boards where necessary. As a proof-of-concept we looked forward to seeing whether adding stickers would aid our decision about whether to purchase a paid subscription service after all...

LLAMA,tldr-41,"NASA will test drive a robot underneath Antarctica's sea ice in preparation for a mission in the subsurface oceans of Jupiter's moon, Europa. Buoyant Rover for Under-Ice Exploration, or BRUIE, is equipped with two wheels to roll along underneath sea ice. It will carry a suite of instruments to characterize the environment and search for life. BRUIE is being developed by engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The rover is 12 inches long (30 centimeters) and 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms), not including its tether. It will be deployed in Antarctica during the austral spring and summer of 2018-2019, and will be attached by a 30-foot-long (9-meter-long) tether to a larger, surface-based platform. This platform will serve as a communications link with scientists and will also collect sunlight via solar panels to provide power to the rover. The rover was designed to climb up under the ice shelf and look back down at the ice-water interface. Its cameras will search for signs of sea anemones and other animals that make their homes in ice. NASA's recent discovery of a probable subsurface lake in the area has made this mission even more compelling, as the ice ceiling above this lake will be an important zone to study. The technology could allow scientists to explore an environment on another world that would otherwise be inaccessible. This could be especially useful on a moon like Europa, which is covered in ice but likely has a subsurface ocean. On Earth, life forms have been found dotted across the tree of life, and part of the reason some organisms survive in extreme environments is because they have unique behaviors and traits that have yet to be discovered. While the Antarctic trek will be a test run for the rover, the ultimate goal is to send a similar device to explore Europa. The purpose of this initial expedition is to test the BRUIE technology in a real-world, icy environment, which will allow the team to develop the robotic platform in preparation for a possible Europa mission. The instrument will survey the ice shelf by looking at the ratio between two types of oxygen atoms - oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 - that make up its water molecules. Liquid water tends to contain more oxygen 16. Because this ratio can change depending on the temperature at which the water froze, scientists can use the ratio to determine the temperature of the water before it froze. They can also tell if it was a liquid, a slushy mixture or a gas when it froze."

It's designed to measure and analyze the chemical composition of sea ice samples for organic molecules. The organic molecules will be analyzed using a miniature instrument called a Portable Automated Sampler. This sampler will look for the presence of organic compounds. Organic molecules are the building blocks of life. The organic molecules found in BRUIE will help researchers understand the chemistry of the ocean in the Dry Valleys.

Buoyant Rover for Under-Ice Exploration, or BRUIE, will be deployed on a mission to Antarctica's Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in late 2023. BRUIE is about the size of a large suitcase, weighs 150 pounds, and is designed to swim through icy water and take samples. The underwater robot will be equipped with sensors to measure temperature, salinity, and pressure, and will also carry a camera and a laser altimeter to map the sea floor. BRUIE's mission will last for several months, and scientists hope that it will provide valuable data about the conditions on Europa, which is thought to have a subsurface ocean that could potentially harbor life."

There will be 50 games available at launch. The first model of the Oculus Quest will ship with 64GB of onboard storage, but it is unclear if there will be a 128GB option. Oculus also announced that Oculus Go would be getting a price drop to 199. The headset is supposedly using the same technology as the Santa Cruz prototype we saw last year. It will feature 6 degrees of freedom and inside out tracking. This means that all the sensors needed for motion tracking will be in the headset. There is a possibility that Oculus Quest will be a rebranded Oculus Go with inside out tracking, but that is just speculation at this point. We will have to wait until next spring to see what Oculus Quest really is. Oculus Quest is designed to bring a wireless VR experience to anyone, anywhere, with the same quality you've come to expect from Oculus. The headset features Oculus Insight technology built-in, so you don't need to set up any external sensors for 6 degrees of freedom tracking. Oculus Insight delivers a hybrid inside-out tracking system, meaning you can use Oculus Quest anywhere in your home - in a bedroom, living room, kitchen, or anywhere in between. Oculus Quest uses the same displays as Oculus Go, with a resolution of per eye and a refresh rate of 72Hz. Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift are completely separate products, both in hardware and software. Quest is not compatible with Rift software. Oculus Quest is designed with a different use case in mind than Oculus Rift, and we believe they'll offer different but equally compelling experiences. Both headsets have the same tracking technology and are built to deliver a great experience. However, the Rift will ship with a higher quality display and audio system, plus support for 5 sensors for expanded room scale tracking. The Rift's higher resolution display and additional room scale sensors will enable many new experiences that won't be possible on the Quest. We'll be launching more than 50 titles with Oculus Quest at launch, including Robo Recall, The Climb, and Moss. We're also excited to be working with some incredible developers on new titles coming exclusively to Quest, including Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series - Episode I, a first-person narrative experience set in the Star Wars universe, Asgard's Wrath, a Norse-inspired action RPG that lets you wield the power of the Gods, and Stormland, a VR action adventure game that lets you explore an alien world. If you're a developer, you can learn more about the Oculus Quest here. We're excited to share more details about Oculus Quest and our full lineup of new VR experiences at Oculus Connect 5 this fall. Oculus Quest will launch in Spring 2019 starting at 399 USD."

BigScience,tldr-43,"Rome is an experimental JavaScript toolchain designed to replace many existing JavaScript tools. All components are custom and there are no third-party dependencies. It includes a compiler, linter, formatter, bundler, HTML generator, documentation generator as well as various other modules. The project was started by a few developers at the University of Cologne who wanted to create their own JavaScript toolchain but without using any already existing framework or library in order not to suffer from licensing restrictions for those libraries. The concept behind Rome is the same like with most language-based development: write your code first; then you can use it later on if you want. In its current form, Rome has been developed over the last two years and implemented into a simple single-page web application that serves also as homepage (living document). The main goal of this tutorial is to introduce users to some basic functionalities available within Rome and demonstrate how they may be used during development. We will start out with building a small example applet which needs only minimal user interaction such as: the ability to register new users and display user data. This usage pattern provides us with several advantages: since we do our work exclusively on client-side with JavaScript, all communication between server and clientside logic happens through SOAP messages so that neither HTTP requests nor redirects need to happen at each request cycle. This means we can remove all unnecessary overheads associated with browser management and state saving - just think about what would have happened had jQuery required additional DOM manipulation routines when requesting URLs! So far these pages were built solely using the template system provided by PrimeFaces 4.0's ResourceBundle implementation. While migrating to PrimeFaces 5.1 led me away from Bootstrap 2.3.2 I found myself back again needing to build similar setups mostly due to obsolete CSS assets included in older versions of Bootstrap. In this section I'll summarize my experiences creating resource bundles via JSF 2.x and present another alternative - extending the default UIResource bundle by adding zero-touch content generation directly via Velocity templates. I don't know why I'm doing stuff like this anymore. However it's clear that even with modern browsers providing support for SVG graphics inline today I'm still forced to execute embedded files in base64 encoded raw representation whenever needed. Some might say ""Why use binary images instead of image files?"" Well I've got one reason for this: having a page render fast enough is crucial for delivering good performance. Even though resources loaded via AJAX call are cached locally, every time a user refreshed a page he gets served with lower quality version because his computer doesn't have more recent copy yet. Here, as usual, comes the devil - caching. Load balancing isn't a big concern here either since both frontend methods rely on standard servers handling load-balanced port 8080. If you're wondering how ImageLoader works inside ajax calls please refer to previous ebook chapter dealing with Ajax Caching while loading images."

It's worth noting that Microsoft's GitHub data was probably the hacker's intended target, but he got sidetracked by some of the files on Github's own public repository, which also includes some confidential data from the likes of Google, Facebook, Adobe, and Twitter. The files were found on the Amazon S3 servers that Microsoft uses to host its own private repositories, but the hacker claims to have removed all of the data. According to the hacker, he has been unable to recover all of the data due to the format of the files, which was likely to prevent anyone else from accessing them. This means that we might not be able to access some of the files that the hacker is now giving away for free. In the meantime, the hacker claims that he is keeping the stolen data private for now, but he will be giving it away to Microsoft at a later date.

It is made of materials taken from nature, such as wood and compost. As an example of this ecological approach to architecture, one can look at the durable construction called Earthbag: Every bag contains 6 kg of earth, sand or soil mixed with water. These bags are then filled into 9 m2 boxes (see picture). The designers had used these boxes for years before starting their research because they were easy to use - even though some elements inside them broke down quickly. With the earthen envelopes the environmental impact has been reduced by 90 compared to conventional building practices. In addition, there have also not been any negative effects on the groundwater table since no drilling took place. For many architects it seems like we need only two decades more until everything around us will be viable again if nothing changes drastically. More than that would take possible solutions too far away from reality. One way to make things happen faster might be through collaborations between different teams working on similar projects.

However, the technology can be used to generate music of a very different kind. For example, in 2016, a group of Dutch academics proposed a song called 'Can AI Kick It'. This song is a combination of dozens of other songs, most of which were famous ones, but the lyrics are especially novel. This was achieved using a process called 'stylistic transfer', where the original songs are combined with the text of the lyrics to create a new song. This is a process which is also used to generate novel text and images, and is one of the techniques which is at the core of 'generative adversarial networks'. The basic idea of the technique is as follows: we start with a group of 'generative models', which each have their own style. The goal of the generative models is to generate images, words or music which match the style of the other models. In this case, the generative models are simply stylised versions of the original songs, and the music is generated by a process called 'transfer learning'. For example, the first song is called 'Footsteps in the Dark'. This song was originally written in 1974 by a woman called Sue Walker, but the computer generated lyrics are quite different. Instead of being about the fear of the dark, they are about a man and a woman in a bar, having a conversation, and about how they both love each other. The second song is called 'Not Fade Away'. This song was originally written by the Beatles in 1967, but the computer generated lyrics are about a man and a woman who are in love, and how the woman is more beautiful than the sun. The process of generating lyrics is a little like a paintbrush, with each generative model being a colour, and the lyrics being a brush stroke. The music is generated by combining these different brush strokes, and the resulting song is quite similar to the original songs, although the lyrics are quite different.

LLAMA,tldr-47,"A group of startups is using end-to-end learning to teach self-driving cars how to drive. Despite investors sinking more than 100 billion into self-driving car technology, driverless tech is still in a phase of experimentation. Investors are beginning to doubt the value of self-driving car technology. The failure of Uber and Lyft's initial public offerings (IPOs) has created a sense of doubt about the future of the self-driving car market. I don't believe that self-driving cars are dead, but I do believe that the way in which they're being developed is flawed. That's why I've decided to highlight a handful of startups that are using a different approach. The main difference between the startups I've mentioned and the big players in the self-driving car market is that the startups I've mentioned are using a technique known as end-to-end learning. End-to-end learning is a process that helps a self-driving car learn how to drive by teaching it how to interpret data captured by a camera. The first step to end-to-end learning is to teach a self-driving car how to process the data captured by a camera. The next step is to teach a self-driving car how to interpret the data captured by a camera. This process allows a self-driving car to learn how to drive by recognizing the difference between objects such as a bicycle and a car, and learning how to respond to these objects. The main problem with the approach taken by most self-driving car companies is that they use techniques such as machine learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive. Most self-driving car companies use machine learning to make driving decisions, such as whether a self-driving car should change lanes or whether a self-driving car should stop. The problem with using machine learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive is that it's too impractical. There are too many different factors involved in driving that need to be taken into account for machine learning to be a viable option. The companies that I've mentioned are using end-to-end learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive. End-to-end learning is a much more practical approach that gives a self-driving car the ability to learn how to drive by recognizing the difference between objects such as a bicycle and a car."

Despite investors sinking more than 100 billion into self-driving car technology, driverless tech is still in its infancy. And while companies like Tesla and Google have made significant strides toward developing autonomous vehicles (AVs), the industry faces a major setback. Last week's crash at Uber's headquarters in San Francisco may trigger an investigation that could lead authorities to consider classifying AVs as human-motor vehicle hybrids under California law. The incident also raised questions about whether traditional auto manufacturers are ready for what this new age of mobility will bring. Based on publicly available information from both sides of the debate - including internal documents obtained by Bloomberg News via open records requests - we can get an idea of where these two groups stand on issues ranging from liability protection to safety standards. The argument goes something like this: Since humans can't be trusted to operate a machine with deadly consequences without fail, it makes sense not only to keep them in control but also to require them possess some level of expertise or training, just so they don't accidentally kill themselves or others. ""It has been my experience that crashes happen because people who work with machines assume too much authority over machines and lack sufficient understanding of their functionality and limitations."" This line of reasoning was echoed across several key statements released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after Thursday night's accident: ""The NHTSA believes that there should always be one person operating manually in vehicles where automated driving capability exists, regardless of the type of automation used. If another individual assists drivers during automatic operation, then relying solely upon assistance provided by another is insufficient, and thus unsafe...autonomous systems must include procedures and safeguards designed to ensure appropriate operator involvement when needed."""

Amazon's work on this project came as part of its long-term goal of developing new technologies for healthcare services. To achieve its goals in such areas, however, the company already has partnerships with several companies. These include Philips Healthcare, which developed algorithms capable of detecting anxiety based on heart rate monitoring, and GE Healthcare, which teamed up with researchers at Stanford University to develop an algorithm that detects stress, depression, anger, happiness and fatigue levels by analyzing skin temperature changes. The wearable technology mentioned above may have been designed specifically as a tool that might help find ways to treat mental health problems. However, it's unclear how much research was actually performed before the product became available to consumers. In addition, there aren't many details provided regarding what types of data were used when making decisions surrounding product design and functionality - only some vague descriptions like ""human emotion."" It seems likely that Amazon made all these promises because they're trying to convince patients that their devices could improve quality of life while helping them avoid medical care altogether. Afterall, not everyone needs medicine prescribed by doctors: At times, just changing your lifestyle habits can make things better. But given that most people who are depressed do go see a doctor anyway, perhaps those promising features won't really change their lives very much. For example, according to Consumer Reports, one study found that following recommendations from apps and online guides didn't seem to prevent more than half of participants suffering depressive episodes within six months after starting treatment.

If the theory is correct, it might offer clues on how to unite quantum mechanics and general relativity, two of the most successful physical theories of the 20th century. The idea of quantum entanglement is that two particles can be linked in a way that means they share the same properties, even if they are separated by a vast distance. This has been shown experimentally, but it has never been observed in a black hole. In a new study, physicists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have developed a theory that suggests that information can be transmitted between two black holes that are entangled. The theory is based on the idea that black holes have a ""firewall"" that prevents information from escaping. However, the firewall is not complete, and it is possible for information to leak through in the form of Hawking radiation. The physicists argue that this Hawking radiation could carry information about the black hole's interior, and that this information could be transmitted to another black hole that is entangled with the first. This would allow information to be transmitted across vast distances, even if the two black holes are separated by the entire universe. If the theory is correct, it could have important implications for our understanding of black holes and the universe.

The idea behind transmitting information through entangled black holes is that, by manipulating one of the black holes, we could affect the other one instantaneously, regardless of the distance that separates them. This violates the laws of classical physics, but is allowed by quantum mechanics, which allows for particles to be linked in a way that goes beyond our everyday experience of the world. If scientists can demonstrate that information can indeed be transmitted in this way, it would provide strong evidence for the existence of quantum gravity, which remains a theoretical concept that has yet to be proven experimentally.

Quantum Entanglement and Black Holes When two quantum particles are entangled, their quantum states are inextricably linked together. A study in 2016 suggested that entanglement might be a way to communicate information across black holes. This 2016 study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers developed a model that showed how a pair of entangled black holes could be used to send a message across the black hole. The message would be encoded in the phase of the entangled black holes, and the phase of the two black holes would change in sync with one another. The information would be sent across the black hole by the tugging of the black hole's gravitational field, which would alter the phase of the black holes, researchers said. The new study ""represents a first step towards the construction of a quantum channel across a black hole,"" the study's authors wrote. ""The question of whether this channel is robust to black hole evaporation is left open for future investigation."" The study's authors suggested that a quantum channel across a black hole might be possible if the entangled black holes were black holes of comparable mass. If the black holes are much different in mass, they would likely evaporate very quickly. If they are both the same size, they would still need to get close enough to each other for the information to be sent across. But, researchers said, it's still possible that quantum entanglement could work. [7 Ways Black Holes Can Help Us] 4. Quantum Communication Across Black Holes Scientists have proposed that quantum entanglement might be used to send information across a black hole. (Image credit: John Martinis, New York University) Quantum entanglement was first proposed in 1935 by Einstein, who was worried that quantum mechanics could be wrong. The physicist thought that quantum mechanics was fine, but that quantum particles were actually in a state of both being in a place and not being in a place at the same time. If this were true, then the particles would be unable to be seen, because there would be no way to distinguish which state the particles were in. Einstein thought that if this were true, it would be possible to communicate with quantum particles without them being detected, and he proposed that this would mean that quantum particles could be used to send information across a black hole. Einstein's ideas were quickly dismissed as ""spooky action at a distance,"" but in the 1990s, scientists began to realize that entanglement might be used to communicate information across a black hole. In 2016, a team of physicists from the University of California, Santa Barbara, proposed that quantum entanglement could be used to send a message across a black hole. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers proposed a system that would use a pair of entangled black holes to send a message across a black hole.

It's powered by a battery that can provide enough energy for a 6-minute flight, and Salzmann can control the wingsuit with a throttle located on his chest. Wearing a helmet with an integrated heads-up display, Salzmann can also view his altitude, speed, and a speed graphic. BMW believes the wingsuit could be used for search and rescue missions, where its capabilities could be used to reach areas that are not easily accessible. It's also possible that the wingsuit could be used in motorsport events. Watch Salzmann take the wingsuit out for a spin in the video below.

BigScience,tldr-53,"Marin County in the San Francisco Bay will pay Uber a subscription fee to use Uber's management software for its high-occupancy vehicle fleet. Marin Transit provides six-seater and wheelchair-accessible vans that are used by passengers on rides booked through The total cost of using this system was 500,000 paid into an escrow account set up with UBI at its first meeting after it adopted new policies. Uber is working out how much money users can expect from their fares when they book using vehicles registered as ""utility"" vehicles (see sidebar) -and what taxpayers should cover under existing ordinance law. The company has requested the city approve this arrangement before July 1, 2019. Newsom's administration appears ready to put aside some concerns about privacy issues raised by critics in Silicon Valley who have criticized his approach over transportation technology companies like Uber. While Newsom told reporters last month he would not sign an executive order banning ride-hailing services such as Uber because California lacks legislative authority to do so, he said Uber's status as a service provider means there needs only be ""a common-sense regulatory framework established."" He also noted that cash-strapped cities often use other methods to manage these companies. Like Comcast Corp., which received 10 billion from New York State to invest in broadband projects throughout the state, or Verizon Communications Inc., which recently picked up hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable lineage from Seattle Public Utilities Co. (SeattlePUC), the deal could come back to bite investors if Washington Gov. Jay Inslee doesn't enact laws giving local governments more say in election oversight. Inslee, who chairs the Council of Governors, announced Wednesday that he wants to create legislation that would require incumbent races within three years of a vote to include voter verification details similar to those currently required for primaries and referenda. If approved by voters, the bill would apply to all municipal elections starting next year. After two months of public comment periods, the legislature must pass any changes prior to November 2020. It may take time to get to the point where states don't need to give telecom firms special deals, but it's clear now that incumbents want to get Congress to change its rules sooner rather than later. The biggest challenges comes with making sure people aren't fined far too quickly. In February 2013, for example, Oregon passed unique voting rights protections that included reporting requirements for suspected fraudulent registrations - something no other state had done previously - and the ability to suspend ballot papers late at night during primary voting days. But it's unclear whether regulators were able to adequately implement them until 2016, when a court found they violated the constitution. Oregon makes a good case study here since it already requires transparency around registration procedures. Another potential threat is misuse of early voting ballots: Last March, voters in four Florida counties reported having been asked to enter incorrect information onto a confirmation form online due to improperly configured computers."

Uber will sell a majority of its food delivery business in South-East Asia to Grab. The deal will see Uber take a 27.5 stake in Grab. Uber Eats in South-East Asia will be folded into Grab's existing food delivery business. Uber has launched a new in-app tipping feature for its drivers.

There was no minimum data requirement for this study so our results include all survey responses regardless of their length. We received 1,661 surveys from 90 countries around the world - including more than 30 percent from North America - mostly by electronic mail but also through online forms hosted at SurveyMonkey andor Qualtrics. The most common response rate across various modes were 20 percent, though some respondents provided multiple submissions: The majority of respondents came from companies ranging in size from 10 employees up to 500,000 workers (Figure 4). Most of them are medium-scale enterprises that employ between 100 and 5,000 people. And team members made up about three-quarters overall - the highest percentage among any demographic category. They're followed closely by executivesowners who make up over one-third. We asked what type of company they worked for: service provider, consultancy firm, government agency, university, etc., which enables us to determine how many might use APMs already. Based on those answers we estimate there could be somewhere within tens-of-thousands to hundreds-of-thousands organizations currently deploying APM technology. Indeed, participating organizations mostly indicated an interest in enterprise-grade products capable of analyzing millions of lines of code per day.

They will continue to remain Alphabet employees and retain their shares. It has been a tumultuous few years for the tech giant after it was accused by former intelligence official Edward Snowden of sharing user data with governments, thereby violating privacy laws. While many people are still not sure what exactly happened in those three months between April 2012 and June 2013 when an NSA contractor hacked into Gmail accounts on behalf of the National Security Agency, two company insiders said that leak had revealed sensitive information about thousands of users such as phone numbers, addresses and emails etc., which resulted in significant financial losses for some companies like Yahoo or credit card issuers like Visa. According to them, both executives were given ""all the leeway"" they needed because they believed in the mission. ""Both Larry and Sergey gave us all we needed to do our jobs without hesitation,"" one informant told Reuters. ""This is something that you see at most top level organizations where there isn't any personal agenda but only a shared belief in common purpose,"" he added. This comes just days before Google officially unveils its second quarter earnings results tomorrow morning (1:30 PM GMT) amidst growing concerns over how much data the company collects from consumers around the world Apple may be able to make money working behind the scenes for other companies like Facebook and Alphabet - according to reports Apple might get paid 5 billion yearly if it's allowed to work exclusively within Microsoft, The Wall Street Journal reported today citing documents obtained through government records requests. The report supports rumors suggesting that Apple would need to sign non-disclosure agreements with its competitors so that Apple can use its technology while designing devices from rival manufacturers, adding up to millions upon billions for each brand involved every single year. In fact, the same sources reveal Apple could earn 2 million per day from Windows Phone 8 sales alone during this first year using its ecosystem services. Microsoft allegedly lets the iPhone maker develop apps for Android phones sold under the ""Microsoft Mobile Device Business Unit"" label instead of making these exclusive downloads available directly. This reportedly means iOS developers aren't getting access to Android-specific features built into third-party applications like Cortana voice assistant, Maps, Picture-in-Picture or Bluetooth pairing. This makes sense considering that Apple historically enjoys better business relationships with Microsoft than having Amazon build software for iPhones. ""We know, especially seeing what's going on in China and India, there's huge potential here,"" says a leading industry executive speaking privately.

Verkada serves companies like Tesla, Cloudflare, and Equinox, so the breach could have affected many more businesses. In a blog post, Verkada said that an unauthorized party gained access to ""some"" of the company's administrative accounts and it was forced to reset all of them. As a result, the company's customers received emails from Verkada that asked them to create new passwords for their administrative accounts. The blog post did not detail how the breach occurred, but the company said it had implemented new security features to protect against such attacks in the future. Verkada has been under fire recently for their security, so the breach comes at an unfortunate time. In November, researchers discovered that Verkada cameras used a default root password that was hard-coded into the devices and could not be changed. The company's CEO and founder Hans Robertson said that the attackers did not gain access to customer footage, but the company's security has been called into question."

Verkada has not said exactly what happened or where it was attacked but on Friday they posted an image that they say is from their systems showing some new patches were installed that fixed vulnerabilities in their products after the initial attack occurred. ""We believe this data leaked as part of an automated campaign by an internal hacker who accessed our database through social engineering techniques (most likely phishing emails),"" wrote CEO David Howard on Twitter. The vulnerability would allow cybercriminals to gain remote administrative control of camera systems via RDP connections which allowed them to download files including images stored within those networks. Unfortunately for Verkada at least half their cameras are still out there being used around the world, so hopefully all these machines have been patched up soonish! In other news, police in Virginia recently arrested three people accused of hacking into HIPAA-protected health records from multiple hospitals across the state, The Guardian reports. Police also recovered thousands of cancer diagnoses linked to patients' names - although only one patient actually had cancer when he received the diagnosis. This comes just days after investigators uncovered evidence connecting another hack to healthcare information belonging to more than 1 million Americans, leading law enforcement officials to warn about potential breaches targeting medical facilities nationwide if anything similar happens again. It's great to see Verkada getting things sorted out quickly before anyone could get non-trivial backups of important private photos and videos from the network."

Tsinghua,tldr-57,"Silicon Valley security startup Verkada suffered a major security breach, with the hackers gaining access to over 150,000 of the company's cameras. Verkada serves companies like Tesla, Cloudflare, and Equinox, and says that the breach happened after hackers gained access to a third-party vendor's database. The company told TechCrunch that it had already disabled the cameras after learning about the hack, and was working with law enforcement and the vendor to resolve the issue. In the meantime, it's asking customers to be on the lookout for a potential malware infection. The company's chief technology officer, Chris Rossignol, said that hackers had gained access to a vendor's database and the company's database, which held customer credentials, but didn't have access to the cameras themselves. He said that the vendor has confirmed that there were no customer data breaches. In addition to alerting customers to the breach, Verkada said it's also working with the vendor to block any access to the cameras in the database, which are in the tens of thousands. Rossignol said that the company had already disabled the compromised cameras, but said that customers should still be on the lookout for a potential malware infection. He also said that Verkada is working with law enforcement to investigate the incident. ""We are continuing to work with the vendor to resolve this issue and will not share additional details until this is complete,"" he said.

Tsinghua,tldr-60,"For those of you who don't know him Rob Walling is an OG internet small business entrepreneur, cohost of the Startups for the Rest of Us, and cofounder of Microconf. A few years ago he was sitting on a bus in downtown Chicago when he had a revelation. ""I realized I'd wasted 10 years of my life trying to become a 'professional internet entrepreneur',"" he said. ""I thought 'What am I doing? I'm not going to live like this for the next 10 years. He realized that the only way he could make the leap into true entrepreneurdom was to start his own business. So he started one. The problem was that it was hard to find funding for a new business. In his search for money, he realized that a lot of the advice he was getting on the internet was wrong. He was told to use business plans, for example. He discovered that a business plan was just a bunch of boring words that investors didn't care about. He said that ""you can make a business plan, it's just that it's not the only thing that matters. The truth is that business plans are the most expensive, least productive way of raising money."" He's not alone in his skepticism of business plans. The Center for Financial Services Innovation, a group of people who believe that financial institutions should be more responsive to small businesses, recently released a report called ""The Value of Business Plans."" The report found that business plans are expensive and don't actually improve the chances of getting funding. What business plans do do, according to the report, is ""slow down the decision making process,"" which makes it harder for small businesses to get funding. The report concluded that business plans are ""an antiquated, unnecessary, and costly process that should be eliminated."" So what's the alternative? How can small businesses get funding without a business plan? A number of small business experts, including Rob Walling, believe that the answer is to ""pitch."" That's a term for pitching a business idea to potential investors. ""Pitching is a much more effective way of raising money than a business plan,"" said Walling. ""You can go and find someone who's willing to invest in you. If you have a business plan, they're going to say 'Why would I invest in you?' If you pitch, they're going to say 'You have a great idea. Let's go get coffee and talk about it. ""Pitching is the opposite of business plan,"" said Phil Kozeny, cofounder of the center for Financial Services Innovation. ""Pitching is going out and talking to people, telling them your story. It's a conversation."" Kozeny said that ""pitching is more informal, it's more natural. You're talking to someone in their living room, in their office, in their backyard, at a bar, anywhere. It's an exchange of ideas. They listen, you listen, you say what you need to say and they say what they need to say."" And it doesn't require a fancy business plan, or even a PowerPoint presentation. ""It's about doing something different. If you're in an office and you're trying to pitch someone you're going to use a business plan,"" said Walling. ""If you're pitching someone out of the blue, you're not going to use a business plan."
LLAMA,tldr-60,"For those of you who don't know him Rob Walling is an OG internet small business entrepreneur, cohost of the Startups for the Rest of Us, and cofounder of Microconf. In 2006 Rob dropped out of a PhD program at the University of Minnesota to start a company with his then-girlfriend Nicole. That company was HitTail. He's been doing startups ever since. Rob's most recent project is Drip, an email marketing automation company that is arguably the best email marketing automation platform available for small businesses. I had a lot of questions for Rob and he was kind enough to oblige. Enjoy! Eli: What does the word ""entrepreneur"" mean to you? Rob: It's a word I shy away from, honestly. I think it's a grossly overused word, especially in the tech startup world, and I don't like how it's used. I don't like how it's used as a blanket term for anyone who starts a business. It's an overused word and I'd prefer to say you're a ""business owner"" or a ""startup founder."" I'm not a huge fan of the word ""entrepreneur"" because it's been overused. Eli: For you, does entrepreneurship ever stop being exciting? Rob: I think it stops being exciting when you're not doing anything new, when you're doing the same thing over and over again and your business gets to a certain size. That's where I am now. It's no longer exciting to get that first paying customer. It's no longer exciting to go to market with a new product. The last few years have been more of an operational, boring management phase, and that's not something I enjoy doing. Eli: So you're not enjoying running Drip as much as you used to enjoy running HitTail and other startups? Rob: I enjoy it much less, yes. The first couple years were exciting as we built a new product, got our first paying customers, and built a team. It was exciting to get those first few employees and get the team growing and working together. It's like raising a child. When they're first born it's super exciting and fun and you get to teach them to walk and talk. Then when they're a teenager it's a pain in the ass. Now I'm in the middle of that teenager phase, where it's a little painful. I'm not having fun doing the day-to-day work, so I'm not enjoying it that much. That's why I'm spending a lot of my time thinking about what my next project will be. Eli: What makes you feel successful as an entrepreneur? Rob: For me, it's having a decent amount of freedom to work on whatever I want to work on. I don't need to make a ton of money. I don't need to be rich. I don't need to be a billionaire. I like having a lot of freedom in my schedule, and the ability to work on whatever I want to work on. Eli: Is that what you're doing now? Rob: Not really. I'm still at the point where I'm working on the business and I'm still very hands on. Eli: When you say you're thinking about your next project are you thinking about starting a new business? Rob: Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a new business, or maybe just an experimental project. I'm not sure I want to do a full-fledged business at this point. I'm at a point in my life where I don't want to be fully engaged in a startup. I'm not going to be raising venture capital. I'm not going to be making it my life's work. I'm just looking for a new project. Eli: You said you want freedom in your schedule. Does that mean you want to be able to work on a new business without taking too much time away from Drip? Rob: Yes, that's exactly it. I want to spend a lot of time with my kids, I want to be able to go to the gym whenever I want, and I want to have the ability to work on whatever I want to work on. That's why I'm not in a hurry to start a new business. I'm"

I was amazed how well the site worked as a teaching tool. This interactive site allows users to play around with a neural network to see how it works. Users can drag around different nodes and see how the neural network changes. Users can change the number of layers and the number of nodes within each layer. Users can then choose from a set of images and use the neural network to classify the images. The most interesting part of the site was the ability to play around with the individual weights. By changing the weights, users can see how the neural network is being influenced by the training data. The code is available on GitHub.

LLAMA,tldr-63,"Open source code has been essential for China's rapidly growing tech sector. GitHub has been a large part of this growth, but its future in China is uncertain. Many fear that Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub may have repercussions for GitHub's open-source projects in China. Software developers in China fear that the acquisition of GitHub, the world's biggest open-source platform, by Microsoft could affect their access to the software development platform. GitHub is an online platform where software developers can collaborate on a project. It is home to about 28 million users and more than 85 million repositories of code. While GitHub is not the only online repository for open-source code, it is the largest and has been particularly popular in China. The uncertainty surrounding GitHub's future in China stems from Microsoft's past. In 2013, Microsoft was one of a number of companies that signed an agreement with China's Cyberspace Administration of China, which prohibited Microsoft from including any software or code in its Windows operating system that threatened national security. The Chinese government is also concerned about the use of GitHub to share open-source code that violates China's cybersecurity laws. In January, for example, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ordered all Windows users to delete any potentially illegal code on GitHub. GitHub's position in China is also complicated by the fact that the country is increasingly turning to open-source software to fuel its growing tech sector, which is reliant on the free software. China has been using open-source code and contributing to the open-source community, and that will only grow. Open-source software has been a key part of China's tech sector. For example, Huawei uses open-source software for its smartphones. China has also been working to develop its own open-source software through its own home-grown operating system, which is still in development."

However, the Chinese government has not yet made any official statements about GitHub's future in the country. Some experts believe that the government may be more tolerant of GitHub because it is primarily used by developers, rather than the general public. Additionally, many Chinese tech companies and developers have already established a strong presence on the platform and may push back against any efforts to ban or restrict it. Overall, the situation remains uncertain, and it is essential for developers in China to stay informed and consider alternative platforms or methods to collaborate and share code if necessary.

This would have a negative impact on the development of new software and technologies in China, and it could also lead to a brain drain of talented developers who leave China to work in countries where they have access to open source code. The Chinese government has been cracking down on free speech and other forms of dissent in recent years, and it is possible that it will also block GitHub in an effort to control the flow of information. If this happens, it will be a major setback for China's tech sector and for the global open source community."
OpenAI,tldr-64,"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be more privacy-focused, with end-to-end encryption being a key feature. Zuckerberg made the announcement in a blog post, stating that he believes privacy is essential for innovation and that the future of communication will be more secure and encrypted. Facebook plans to integrate its messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, to allow users to communicate across different platforms while maintaining encryption. However, some critics are concerned about the impact of encryption on safety and security, as it can make it difficult for law enforcement to monitor criminal activity. Zuckerberg said that Facebook is committed to working with law enforcement and governments to balance privacy and safety concerns. Overall, it seems that Facebook's move towards encryption signals a shift towards a greater emphasis on privacy and security, which could benefit users but also raises important questions about the balance between privacy and safety in the digital age."
BigScience,tldr-64,"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be in public key cryptography, or PGP. ""We know it's not perfect and we can always do better but at this point I think we're on track with what people really want for their communications,"" he said. The move is significant because it represents an evolution from the long-standing position of the social network that encrypted communication would compromise privacy and security, which has been used as justification both for its current approach - which allows messages to pass through third parties such as WhatsApp before reaching someone who isn't connected directly - and also recently called into question when Cambridge Analytica gained access to data stored by users without permission (via The Guardian). In announcing his decision, Mark added: ""We've made tremendous strides in advancing our core commitment to user autonomy over the years. We've built robust features like 'friends' lists so that you can still make friends even if you're outed online. We support multiple methods of sharing information among your groups of interest ... while giving people the choice between open and private conversations within these communities. But we've never believed there's anything more powerful than securely communicating privately using end-to-end encryption. It gives us all control over what happens next after you've sent something personal... And that's why we'll continue sending every message under PGP until everyone believes privacy needs are met."" While there have already been instances where consumers turned against companies as they failed to keep up with emerging technology, the focus now shifts toward those whose policies may put them at risk following revelations about massive data breaches. Facebook has reportedly lost millions of accounts due to hackers gaining access to the business account of former Vice President Joe Biden. (Supplied) It was only weeks ago that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promised to use PGP in place of weakened encryption protocols that were being developed alongside Google-owned Signal messenger. But this week reports emerged claiming that the tech giant had told employees to stop talking about the new initiative andor reporting any bugs exponentially since late last year - even though no action was taken immediately; Twitter insiders insist it wasn't staff constraints, but rather management issues. As well as raising concerns around governance, however, criticism has grown as technological changes go unnoticed and prompt misconceptions surrounding them. It's crucial we educate ourselves regarding digital safety measures. That's the goal behind my SecretsOfInternet campaign pic.twitter.comyQWgohN7MA - Rachel Louise (RLouise) September 28, 2018 But limiting some people's ability to communicate via a platform might seem counterproductive given that news organisations increasingly rely on the web-based mediums they operate off to sustain themselves financially; indeed, major publishers including BBC News agreed to fundamentally change how they run their operations once policymakers asked for input on improving internet regulation during last year's Internet Governance Forum meeting held in Tallinn, Estonia. On Wednesday, UK Parliament voted 332-149 in favour of introducing legislation banning sites like YouTube and TikTok from accessing government documents needed to comply with requests for transparency requests unless they've obtained consent from the producers of content. A similar proposal aimed at increasing EU citizens' privacy rights appeared unlikely to gain approval, with critics accusing Brussels of trying to censor free speech. Nevertheless, activists across Europe spoke publicly about the dangers posed by large corporations having too much power amid increased surveillance and tighter regulation prompted by changes in society and government policy, making clear that they're fighting back. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, whose country came under scrutiny due to controversial cyber-security laws passed earlier this month, vowed her administration wouldn't let big tech dictate ""how we live our lives."""
Tsinghua,tldr-64,"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be end-to-end encrypted, and hinted that there could be more to come. ""I want to explain how we're working to make sure that people can safely and securely communicate with each other on Facebook, and how we're working to create more ways for people to share their thoughts and ideas,"" he said in the statement. Facebook has long faced accusations that it has exploited its platform for political ends, and Zuckerberg has previously acknowledged that encryption could be one way to make the platform safer. In the statement, Zuckerberg says that the company has been working on the issue for several years, and he gives some detail on how the company is approaching the issue. Zuckerberg says that encryption will help protect users, and that it is ""an essential tool for protecting people's safety."" He said that the company is exploring end-to-end encryption for Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which all have over 1 billion users. ""These are important issues, and we're not going to solve them all in one step,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""I'm committed to ensuring that our teams work together to address these issues, and that we have a broad community of users, experts, and policymakers to help guide us as we do."" The move will come as a surprise to many in the tech industry, as Facebook has previously resisted embracing end-to-end encryption. In 2016, the company told the Financial Times that it was not interested in creating end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp, and that the technology would be difficult to implement and not worth the effort. Facebook has previously argued that the technology would be difficult to implement and not worth the effort. It's not clear if the company is now changing its mind. The company's messaging platforms are used by people around the world, and it's a clear sign of how seriously Zuckerberg is taking encryption and the importance of privacy.

LLAMA,tldr-64,"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be end-to-end encrypted, meaning that Facebook and even the government won't be able to read your messages, unless of course you want them to. In an open letter to Facebook users, Zuckerberg detailed the plan to build a unified ""privacy-focused"" messaging platform that will be powered by Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. The platforms will continue to be separate apps, but their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified. The ultimate goal, Zuckerberg says, is to develop a ""simple, fast, reliable and private"" platform that people can use for secure communication. The shift to encryption, Zuckerberg said, will be a ""positive force in the world"" by preventing abuse and by building a space where people can share information securely. Zuckerberg says that his company has been working on this plan for the last six years, and the company is investing tens of billions of dollars to make it a reality. He says that the shift will allow the company to compete with the ""E2E"" messaging platforms that have become popular in countries where WhatsApp isn't dominant. ""People want to know their data is secure, and they want to be able to communicate privately,"" Zuckerberg writes. ""We're working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks."" Zuckerberg says that this means Facebook will need to rebuild its business around encryption. He says this means that it will be harder to prevent harmful content from spreading, and harder for governments to keep track of illegal activity. He says that Facebook will work with law enforcement to address these concerns, and that it will build its own systems for detecting harmful content, but that the trade-offs are worth it. Zuckerberg acknowledges that Facebook has been a bit of a pariah in recent years, and says that the company is taking steps to change its image. He says that Facebook is now working to rebuild its reputation. ""I understand that many people don't think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform - because frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services,"" he writes, ""and we've historically focused on tools for more open sharing."" He says that Facebook has been thinking about these privacy issues for ""a long time,"" and that it's been working on these plans since before the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit last year. Zuckerberg says that Facebook will still provide some useful services to advertisers, but that these services will be limited to targeting and measurement. Facebook won't be able to provide them with access to user data, he says. ""I understand that many people don't think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform - because frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services"" He added: ""We're building a foundation for social communication aligned with the direction people increasingly care about: messaging each other privately in encrypted services."" Zuckerberg says that Facebook will be holding discussions and debates about the future of the internet over the coming months, and that he hopes to ""work through"" the various issues that the company's new vision will raise. ""I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever,"" Zuckerberg writes.

It was developed by the Amnesty International Technologies team in collaboration with the Coalition Against Surveillance Exports (CAUSE). Forensic traces collected by MVT can be used as a starting point for further investigation. Investigators can use them as part of their investigative work, or forensic analysis or legal proceedings. MVT collects the following forensic traces from the devices: Call logs, including call history, missed calls, and unanswered calls. SMSs, including the message content and the sender details. Contacts, including the details about a contact as well as the call and SMS history of the contact. Calendars, including event details and meeting participants. Browser history, including the details of the browsed web pages. Media files, including audio and video files, as well as photos. Installed applications, including application details and application-specific data. WhatsApp, including conversations and multimedia files. Facebook, including conversations and multimedia files. Telegram, including conversations and multimedia files. Emails, including email contents and the sender details. MVT tools are written in Python. The toolkit is built as a series of modular scripts to ensure that it can be easily expanded. Currently, MVT supports the collection of forensic traces from Android devices. The scripts use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to interact with the device. The adb tool is part of the Android SDK, which can be downloaded from the Android Developer website. You can find the installation instructions in our GitHub repository. By default, the Android Debug Bridge (adb) tool is configured to use a USB connection to interact with Android devices. This means you will need physical access to the device. If the device supports it, you can also interact with it over the Wi-Fi network. To do so, you must configure adb to connect over Wi-Fi. You will also need to enable USB debugging on the device. The user manual provides detailed instructions about how to use the tools. It is essential that the user consents to the collection of their data. Consent should be obtained before the collection of forensic traces commences. Please note that MVT does not perform any data analysis or interpretation. It is up to the investigator to determine the relevance of the data collected by the toolkit. Please note that MVT is still in development and is not intended to be used in production at this time. The toolkit is currently available in English. We have provided a list of considerations for the use of MVT. Please contact us if you have any questions or feedback."

Tsinghua,tldr-66,"China blocked Wikipedia in April, using DNS injections to prevent its citizens from accessing the encyclopedia. There has been no official statement as to why the website was blocked. In August 2011, 440,000 users in China were affected by a DDoS attack that originated from China. The attack lasted for over 24 hours. In January 2012, The Register reported that in order to circumvent censorship in China, users were using VPNs. It was also reported that several VPN providers were operating in China, in violation of local law. The government's censorship of Wikipedia has been criticized by other websites, such as Google. In April 2011, Google's then-President Eric Schmidt expressed concern about the block on Wikipedia. Schmidt said, ""If you're a user in China and you want to look up some information on the Web, the Wikipedia entry for, say, a human rights lawyer in China is blocked. That's something we think is wrong."" In August 2011, Google launched a project called ""We the Internet"" to encourage Chinese people to ""provide, share, and organize information about their lives."" Organizers hoped that the initiative would ""create a more open, more transparent, and more accountable China."" However, the project was reportedly canceled in September 2011. In October 2011, a statement was released by the Wikipedia Foundation, calling for a ""Chinese Wikipedia"" to be established. The statement said, ""We understand the concerns about the censorship of the Chinese Wikipedia and understand that China does not allow open, uncensored discussion on its Internet."" In November 2011, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, ""The Chinese government never interferes in other countries' Internet governance, and does not control their domestic Internet."" In February 2012, Google announced it was suspending operations in China, in part due to pressure from the Chinese government. The Chinese government has been accused of censoring news, including censoring Wikipedia. In September 2012, Google shut down its Chinese search engine, Google.cn. On November 1, 2012, Google removed Google.cn from its list of search engines, citing ""technical problems."" Google was not permitted to make a statement about the removal, and the official explanation for the removal was that ""the Chinese government is concerned about the company's ties to the Communist Party."" Google.cn was replaced by a link to Google's global search engine. On February 1, 2013, Google resumed censored searches in China, this time by setting up a censorship circumvention tool, known as the ""tor"" system, which allows users to bypass the site's ban on certain keywords. In May 2013, the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) reported that Chinese users had accessed more than 100 million Wikipedia articles. On May 23, 2013, a Wikipedia article about a popular Chinese singer was removed from the Chinese version of Wikipedia. The article, which was about the singer and her performance at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, was removed for a reason that has not been made public. On July 21, 2013, the Wikipedia website was banned in China. The site's operator, the Wikimedia Foundation, announced that the site had been blocked in China, with no explanation. The Chinese government denied the claim. On July 22, 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Chinese government was in the process of developing a ""Chinese Wikipedia."" The announcement stated that the project was in its early stages and that ""the Chinese government does not control the domestic Internet in China, and does not censor Internet information."" However, the announcement did not clarify whether the project would be an independent encyclopedia or a ""Chinese version"" of Wikipedia. The government also stated that the government did not ban Wikipedia, and that ""China does not interfere in other countries' Internet governance."" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs later clarified that the Chinese government was not blocking Wikipedia. The project has been criticized by human rights groups and the European Union. In November 2013, the European Union requested that the Chinese government provide more information about the project. In April 2014, the project was suspended, and it was unclear whether it would resume. In October 2014, the project was revived. In July 2015, the Chinese government reportedly removed some pages about Chinese celebrities from Wikipedia. In February 2016, the Chinese government reported that it had blocked Wikipedia for 336,906 times in 2015, with 96 percent of the blockings occurring in China."

LLAMA,tldr-66,"China blocked Wikipedia in April, using DNS injections to prevent its citizens from accessing the encyclopedia. There has been no official statement as to why the website was blocked. In the past, China has blocked websites to prevent the spread of information it deems damaging to the Communist Party, or to the country's international image. Wikipedia was not the only site affected. China also blocked online encyclopedias such as Baidu Baike and Hudong. VPNs are the best way for Chinese citizens to access Wikipedia. The Great Firewall of China (GFW) relies on IP blocking and DNS injections to censor its citizens. A VPN will circumvent both of these measures, allowing citizens to access Wikipedia, and any other blocked website, anonymously. Social media and messaging platforms are also common targets for Chinese censors. The GFW has blocked many of the world's most popular apps, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. VPNs are the only way to safely access these services, as they encrypt your internet traffic, preventing the Chinese government from seeing what you're doing online. When you connect to a VPN, you're effectively 'hiding' your computer behind the VPN server's IP address. As a result, the GFW cannot see your computer's IP address, or the content you're accessing. The best VPNs for China use advanced obfuscation techniques, which make it almost impossible to detect you're using a VPN. They also have a large network of servers around the world, giving you plenty of options for overcoming the Great Firewall. Using a VPN is not illegal in China, but it is a gray area. As a result, VPN providers usually don't offer customer support in China, which can be a problem if the app stops working. The best VPNs have excellent customer support outside China. Aside from customer support, the best VPNs for China offer the following key features. Large number of servers around the world - The more servers a VPN has, the more options you have for circumventing the Great Firewall. DNS leak protection - Some VPNs leak your DNS requests, which can give away your true location. DNS leak protection prevents this, and is especially important in China. Obfuscation - The Great Firewall actively tries to block VPN traffic, which is why advanced obfuscation is key. A VPN that uses OpenVPN over TCP is the best option, as it's virtually impossible to detect. Excellent customer support - Although VPNs are not illegal in China, they are a gray area. As a result, many VPN providers don't offer customer support in China. The best VPNs for China offer 247 customer support outside China. ExpressVPN is the best all-around VPN for China. It's incredibly fast, with servers in 94 countries around the world, including multiple servers in Hong Kong. It also has great obfuscation techniques, including OpenVPN over TCP, which is almost impossible for the Great Firewall to block. ExpressVPN is based in the British Virgin Islands, and keeps no logs of your online activity. This is important, as it prevents the Chinese government from accessing your data, even if it demands it from ExpressVPN.

Human coronaviruses are common in the United States, and can cause mild to moderate illness. Symptoms include: In more severe cases, coronaviruses can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death. The CDC says that the best way to prevent the virus is to avoid being exposed to it. The organization recommends following good hand hygiene, which includes washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. The CDC also recommends staying home when you are sick, and covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. Symptoms of the new coronavirus may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 after exposure. The CDC recommends that anyone who has traveled to Wuhan, China and feels sick with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing to seek medical care right away.

The World Health Organization recently warned that the window of opportunity to contain the disease was narrowing, but many experts fear that it has now started to become a pandemic. While the coronavirus is less deadly than SARS, it is significantly more contagious, with most of the symptoms of the virus only showing up two weeks post-infection. This leaves plenty of time for the virus to spread before the patient is quarantined. Children also seem to be immune to the effects of the virus, so it is unknown if they are carriers. Most cases of the virus probably remain undetected, so every country needs to be prepared to deal with an outbreak. Slowing the virus' spread might prolong an epidemic, but it will cause less damage overall. For now, it is best to start slowly preparing for the case of quarantines, as strong measures may be implemented to combat the virus."

LLAMA,tldr-68,"France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, since the carrier would use nuclear energy to power its propulsion system and electrical generators. The ship, to be named the PA 2 (Porte-avions 2 or ""aircraft carrier 2 will be used to launch jets and drones, according to The National Interest. France also plans to equip it with F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically on the carrier. The French government is reportedly eyeing the design of the US Navy's Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. The new ship will reportedly feature a nuclear reactor capable of producing 200 megawatts of electricity. The Charles de Gaulle, by comparison, is powered by two 150-megawatt reactors. The decision to use nuclear propulsion is a controversial one, as it runs counter to Macron's goal of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. Nuclear power plants produce fewer greenhouse gases than traditional fossil fuel power plants, but France still has a history of nuclear disasters. The country has been the site of three nuclear accidents, including one in 1999, when an explosion at the Marcoule nuclear site killed one person and injured four. The Charles de Gaulle carrier is only capable of carrying 18 Rafale fighter jets, which is a small amount compared to the US Navy's aircraft carriers, which can carry around 60 planes. The French carrier also has a short flight deck, making it more difficult to launch and land planes. The PA 2's design will address this problem, as it will be able to launch more planes and will be equipped with a catapult, which will allow it to launch heavier aircraft like the F-35. France's Defense Minister, Florence Parly, told reporters last month that she wants to ""make the most of our investment"" in the F-35. ""It is not a question of following the United States, but of making sure that we are able to operate the carrier that we have as soon as possible,"" she said. France has already ordered 30 F-35 fighter jets. It is reportedly considering buying another 30 in the future."
OpenAI,tldr-68,"France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, It may seem counterintuitive to some, but nuclear-powered carriers are actually considered to be more environmentally friendly than conventionally powered ones. They produce less pollution and emit fewer greenhouse gases. This is because they do not rely on fossil fuels such as oil and gas to create energy, but rather on nuclear fission reactions. In addition to the environmental benefits, nuclear-powered carriers are known for their endurance and range, as they can remain at sea for long periods of time without refueling. This makes them ideal for long-range missions and operations. However, nuclear-powered carriers can also be controversial due to concerns over safety and the potential for nuclear accidents. There have been several high-profile incidents involving nuclear-powered vessels in the past, such as accidents at the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plants. Overall, the decision to build a nuclear-powered carrier is a complex one that involves weighing the benefits and drawbacks of this technology against other options.

Users can supply M2cgen with a range of models (linear, SVM, tree, random forest, or boosting) and the tool will produce source code that compiles to run on their target platform. In addition to generating compiled programs from machine learning-based prediction algorithms, M2C allows users to use common programming languages such as python and C to build custom applications for processing data generated by other software systems. For example, if an application running in MATLAB requires some dataset generation capabilities, you could write them using routines available in one of three language binding interfaces provided: MATLAB CX, CX, or VisIt. By writing your own Python script instead of relying on existing packages like pandas, PandasPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scipy, NLTK, GDAL, matplotlib, etc., you gain control over the model training process and are able to produce highly configurable applications specific to your needs. The ability to reuse libraries written in non-standard program languages also makes it easier to re-use code across projects while reducing technical debt. Such developers tend to have more experience with their chosen solution environment than they do when developing proprietary components. This consistency means less risk - less duplicated effort, and hopefully fewer bugs. When building new machines, it's important to consider how much time should be spent into the design phase versus implementing the algorithm inside either hardware-specific modules or external computational units (like GPUs). As discussed earlier, there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach here; rather, each architecture has its pros and cons which must be carefully weighed against one another before making any decisions about what it is best suited for. One area where this becomes particularly apparent is within the field of deep-learning research. Deep convolutional networks require significant amounts of computing resources - sometimes hundreds of Teraflops - in order to perform well enough to achieve good results on standard benchmarks. While several different architectures exist today, none offer all-encompassing performance solutions across all operating environments. Therefore, depending upon whether you're working on distributed frameworks, multi-core processors, graphical processing units (GPU), graphics cards, supercomputers, clusters, local servers, cloud services, mobile devices, etc., not only does designing one's system take careful consideration but so too does deciding which component (s) are most suitable given the current demands placed on one's project at hand. Coupled with these considerations regarding finding optimal setup parameters, comes the need for the development team to spend considerable time optimizing every part of the stack. The combination of both scientific knowledge and expertise required to develop these kinds of tools often times leaves engineers struggling to incorporate advances without compromising efficiency. In many cases, this drives customers towards third-party vendors who specialize in computer vision problems because these companies understand precisely which technologies are necessary to solve real world issues and therefore avoid duplicating efforts along the way. With Machine-to-Code technology gaining traction throughout industry, we expect to see even greater integration between AI researchers and development teams moving forward. From our perspective, cybersecurity organizations looking to capitalize on advancements made in this space should ensure that any new products developed by IT departments are consistent with best practices recommended by experts within this domain. These rules-of-thumb help reduce the likelihood of introducing weaknesses into machine learning-enhanced security processes and extend the overall lifecycle of end user deployments, thus ensuring maximum productivity gains.

Tsinghua,tldr-70,"Scientists have found a way to control the blood-brain barrier at a molecular level and open it up for a couple of hours at a time. The absence of a barrier could make the brain more vulnerable to infection, and it could also affect the development of the brain and how the brain functions. The scientists are developing a drug to open the blood-brain barrier in patients with cancer and stroke, as well as people who have suffered head injuries. The drug is already being used in the clinic, and clinical trials will begin soon. ""If the blood-brain barrier is opened up for a couple of hours, we may be able to improve how the brain responds to cancer drugs,"" said Dr. Phil Rubin, who is a member of the Interdisciplinary Brain Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the lead investigator on the project. The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, is based on a naturally occurring process in the body called the transcytosis of nanoparticles. This process allows nanoparticles to pass from the bloodstream to the brain without passing through the blood-brain barrier. The researchers found that they could change the chemical makeup of the nanoparticles, and thereby change their transcytosis ability, which led to the opening of the blood-brain barrier. ""If you change the surface of the nanoparticles, you can get them to pass through the blood-brain barrier. We wanted to see if we could change the nanoparticles in such a way that they could be used to open up the blood-brain barrier for short periods of time,"" said Dr. Rubin. The research team, led by Dr. Rubin and the Interdisciplinary Brain Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, studied the molecular structure of the nanoparticles. The researchers used light-activated molecules called stilbenes to change the surface of the nanoparticles. ""Stilbenes are naturally occurring molecules that can be used to change the chemical makeup of nanoparticles, and we use them to open up the blood-brain barrier,"" said Dr. Rubin. ""We think that these molecules may be more easily absorbed by the brain and may be less toxic than the drugs that are currently used to open up the blood-brain barrier."" To test their hypothesis, the researchers placed the nanoparticles in the bloodstream of mice and monitored them with a light microscope. ""We were able to open up the blood-brain barrier for a few hours, and the mice showed no signs of toxicity,"" said Dr. Rubin.

The most well known language within this group is Arabic-inspired Turkish. It was introduced by Ottoman Turks into Russia during their rule from 1453 until 1917. Today approximately 40 million people speak it in Turkey alone, although its influence extends far beyond that country's borders. (There are also large populations speaking different forms of Turkish on Cyprus' Greek side; in Croatia; and among some Muslim minorities in Germany.) A great deal has been written about the history of the Kurds since they were first recognized as an ethnic minority nation under Ottoman Empire rules more than two centuries ago. In 1915, one year before World War I began with France's entry into the war, Kurds rebelled against Turkey but collapsed after heavy fighting. Subsequent attempts at settling these conflicts have led the international community to recognize three separate states based upon Kurdistan Nationalism: In the 1920s, the Young Turk Revolution saw the introduction of secularism into Western-style government and national identity formation processes. At the same time, the allure of Communists inspired many young Kurds across Iraq to flock to the Soviet Union and join the ranks of the PKK. While communist support waned once Assad came back into power in Syria in 2000, anti-American sentiment which had begun earlier in the decade continued to fan fire amongst Kurdish militants throughout the Middle East. Today the Democratic Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq both represent democratic examples of how coexistence within non-communal societies can lead to minimal conflict between neighboring nations. For example, while the administration of Erdogan has provoked unrest within his own nation over several issues including accusations of religious intolerance and persecution of unbelievers, neither he nor any other leader in nearby Nicosia or Baghdad has ever engaged in violence directly towards each other despite challenges regarding border disputes and territorial claims. Meanwhile, while there is strong disagreement concerning whether the Iraqi state should go forward as a multi-ethnic unity based upon confessional identities rather than ethnicity, no single faction has gained control through armed strife thus far either."

PaLM,tldr-71,"Insulin is essential for a diabetic, and it can be expensive, especially for those without good insurance. A growing movement of biohackers is trying to build a distributed system of “insulin fridges” where people can store and share insulin with each other. This could help to reduce the cost of insulin and make it more accessible to those who need it. The insulin fridges are typically located in public places like libraries or community centers. They are equipped with refrigerators and freezers to store insulin, as well as educational materials about diabetes and insulin. People who need insulin can access the fridges by using a key code or by showing their prescription. The insulin fridges are a valuable resource for people who need insulin but cannot afford to buy it. They also help to reduce the stigma associated with diabetes by providing a safe and supportive space for people to talk about their condition. The insulin fridges are a grassroots effort to make insulin more accessible to people who need it. They are a testament to the power of community and the importance of sharing resources."
OpenAI,tldr-71,"Insulin is essential for a diabetic, and it can be expensive, especially for those without good insurance. A growing movement of biohackers is trying to build a distributed system of insulin production and distribution to make the life-saving medication more accessible and affordable. Some biohackers are experimenting with genetically modifying yeast to produce insulin, while others are working on creating small-scale insulin manufacturing facilities using open-source hardware and software. These efforts have the potential to disrupt the traditional pharmaceutical industry and make insulin more accessible to people in need. However, it is important to note that these efforts are still in their experimental stage, and it is crucial to prioritize safety and efficacy in any attempt to produce or distribute medical treatments."

Musk put his Californian houses on the market and expanded operations in Texas through his companies SpaceX and Tesla. He cited California's high taxes and strict lockdown measures as reasons for his desire to leave the state. Additionally, Texas offers a business-friendly environment with lower taxes and less regulation. Musk has also expressed his appreciation for Texas' diverse and dynamic economy, which provides ample opportunities for growth and innovation. While it is not yet clear when Musk plans to make the move, it seems likely that he will relocate to the Lone Star State in the near future."
BigScience,tldr-72,"Elon Musk has told several of his close friends and associates that he is planning to move to Texas. Musk put his Californian houses on the market and expanded operations into Canada, Australia and France. Musk said earlier this month when the Tesla Cybertruck debuted in late January at New York's Javits Center that it was time for a new chapter after getting frustrated with the number of lawsuits filed against him by disgruntled buyers who didn't like their vehicles' colors or driving characteristics as promised. Bloomberg News reported last year that Trump administration officials had explicitly asked Musk not to sell any more cars until they could prove how safe were the electric vehicle designs used in its production process and whether there are issues such as overheating that can result in fire. The U.S. Department of Justice sued Hyundai Motor Group Inc., Kia Motors Corp. and other carmakers in 2017 saying some of them failed to adequately test batteries made from dangerous substances known as tetraethyl lead (TEL). The suit also accused the manufacturers of intentionally hiding information about dangers posed by using these materials."

LLAMA,tldr-73,"Neuromorphic computing hardware is special hardware developed to model the behavior of biological neurons. A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that mimics synaptic connections. The researchers used phase-change materials (PCMs) for developing the hardware, which allows the creation of non-volatile, reversible and scalable memories. The materials can be electrically switched between a crystalline state that is conducting and an amorphous state that is insulating. A neuromorphic chip has synaptic devices with two inputs and one output. The output of the device is an analog output that is equivalent to the synaptic weight. The researchers used PCMs to develop synaptic devices that have a non-linear behavior. The devices were then combined to create the hardware that mimics the neurons. The neuromorphic chip was tested by creating a perceptron that classifies different input patterns into different output categories. The chip is a proof-of-concept that can be used for creating neuromorphic chips with high-density connectivity. The PCMs can be made compatible with the CMOS technology and hence can be integrated with the current memory chips and transistors. The researchers hope that the PCM synaptic devices can be scaled up to create the non-volatile analog memories for machine learning."

A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that is made from organic materials and could lead to more energy-efficient computing. The researchers, from the University of California, Berkeley, created the hardware using a material called graphene, which is a single layer of carbon atoms. Graphene is a very good conductor of electricity, and it is also very strong and flexible. The researchers were able to create a circuit made from graphene that could mimic the behavior of a biological neuron. The new hardware could lead to more energy-efficient computing because it does not require the same amount of power as traditional silicon-based computing hardware. This could be a major advantage for applications such as artificial intelligence, where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly."

BigScience,tldr-73,"Neuromorphic computing hardware is special hardware developed to model the behavior of biological neurons. A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that can be used in place of silicon for neural networks. In their paper, published online December 31st by ACS Nano, they describe this new type of neuromorphic computing chip called self-powered neuron chip (SPoC). The SPoC chips were designed using the so-called energy-efficient programmable resistor array technology, which used programmable resistance and capacitance values to achieve ultra-low power consumption with speed comparable to conventional CMOS logic circuits but at much lower cost. As shown in figure 1, when CSA sends an input signal towards the neurons on the network, these transistors are turned ON or OFF depending upon the magnitude of the incoming signal and its polarity. This results in a change in the current flowing through the transistor's metal oxide semiconducting layer such that it increases or decreases accordingly. Therefore, the output voltage of each cell will also vary according to the net currents coming out of all other cells connected together as part of the network. Having this information available allows the resulting data stream generated by a particular circuit pattern within any given learning algorithm to easily be identified and processed immediately due to the reduced number of switching operations required between different levelsthresholds while processing the signals. Using this system, it was possible for the team to create artificial neuronal systems capable of performing simple tasks like detecting edges without affecting them nor compromising performance over time. Figure 1: The design process involved creating 3-dimensionally arranged arrays containing individual nano-tubes where one nanotube represents an electronic device able to control hundreds of nanometer-sized neurons We need more research into effective ways to integrate potential improvements However, there still remains much room for improvement. Among the various challenges faced during development of the SPoC chips, Shih et al report: 1) Because most works on neuromorphic technologies use serial connections between processing elements that result in slow communication speeds. 2) Large numbers of parallel connections exist between units, however it is not clear how many parallel paths would provide better speedenergy efficiency than serial ones. 3) With respect to training algorithms, large amounts of historical data must first be stored before being accessed during training. This problem has yet to find an effective solution and requires further investigation. 4) The ability to obtain high-frequency spike patterns representing features found in natural objects may allow deep reinforcement learning methods to improve both accuracy and running times drastically.

Tsinghua,tldr-73,"Neuromorphic computing hardware is special hardware developed to model the behavior of biological neurons. A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that mimics the neuron's synaptic interactions. The non-silicon neurons are a result of combining the principles of physics, fluid dynamics, and computation. The hardware can be a set of piezoelectric crystals that are connected to one another and act as the electrical synapses. The non-silicon neurons are the flow of water in the crystal. In the simulation, the flow of water is monitored by the piezoelectric crystals, and this data is fed into the non-silicon neuron. The non-silicon neuron, which has 1,024 synaptic inputs, generates an output based on the flow of water in the piezoelectric crystals. The researchers were able to develop the non-silicon neuron by using the flow of water in the piezoelectric crystals. They have developed a technique that can generate the flow of water in the crystals based on the pulse of electricity. The technique is similar to the neurotransmitters of the neurons in the brain. The piezoelectric crystals can be connected to each other to form the circuit. The researchers used this circuit to generate the flow of water. This data is fed into the non-silicon neuron, which generates an output based on the flow of water in the piezoelectric crystals. ""We developed a non-silicon neuron by using the flow of water in the piezoelectric crystals,"" said the study's lead author, Shahrzad Bayat, a professor at the University of Florida. ""We used this technique to generate the flow of water in the crystals based on the pulse of electricity. The technique is similar to the neurotransmitters of the neurons in the brain."" The researchers are working on further improving the technique. They are using the developed technique to develop a better non-silicon neuron that can be used for different applications. ""This technique will help to build a non-silicon neuron that is more advanced and can be used for different applications,"" Bayat said. ""We are using this technique to build a non-silicon neuron that can control robots and be used in a smart city."""

LLAMA,tldr-74,"Traitor packages methods to exploit local misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in order to gain root access. Users can just run the binary on the target machine and it will exploit most of the possible vulnerabilities to gain root access. Traitor is able to run in headless mode and can be controlled via SSH. The tool ships with a default configuration file that can be modified to only exploit vulnerabilities that should be avoided. Traitor can also be used to clean up after it is done to remove traces of its activity on the target machine. Being a penetration tester, I have noticed that the most common method for gaining root access on a machine is via SSH. Most of the time this can be achieved by a simple brute force attack. This type of attack is usually not noticed by the administrator of the machine because no one will notice a machine that has been cracked. If you don't have a remote shell access, the next step is to gain access to the console of the target machine and use a Live-CD that contains all the tools that you need. If you are lucky, you can gain access to the console of the machine by simply walking into a data center and opening the case of the target machine. This is usually possible, since most companies don't have security guards in their data centers. If you have no physical access to the machine, the next step is to connect to it via network. In the worst case you have to plug a network cable into the target machine. In the best case you have already gained access to a machine that is in the same network as the target machine. You can either try to exploit local vulnerabilities in the operating system that the target machine is running or exploit local misconfigurations that provide you with an easy way to get root access. This is where traitor comes into play. traitor runs on the target machine and exploits misconfigurations and vulnerabilities to gain root access. If traitor runs in a headless mode, it will connect via SSH to the attacker's machine and send the output of the commands to the attacker's machine. If the attacker has no access to the target machine, traitor provides a way to install an SSH server on the target machine and run a Netcat listener. After the Netcat listener is running, the attacker can connect to the target machine via Netcat and control traitor. Traitor can also be used to remove all traces of the attack. When it is finished, it will automatically clean the file system, registry and the memory. After traitor is finished, there will be no traces of the attack. Traitor is built in C with the Qt framework and it has a modular design. It is released under the GPLv3 license. This project is not endorsed by any company, organization or institution. Traitor comes with a configuration file that allows you to customize what it should do and how it should do it. The configuration file can be found in the traitor folder. The file is called ""traitor.conf"" and is a regular text file. The configuration file is separated into sections. Each section has a header with the name of the section. There are four different sections. The first section defines what traitor should do when it is finished. The second section defines which vulnerabilities should be used. The third section defines which misconfigurations should be used. The fourth section is a debugging section and will be explained in a later part. The following configuration files will show you how to run traitor to exploit all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It will clean the file system, registry and memory. You can also use it to gain remote shell access via SSH. The following configuration file will give you a good overview of how to modify traitor to use specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It will also clean the file system, registry and memory.

PaLM,tldr-75,"Amazon is developing a technology that will allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands, allowing them to purchase items with their palms. The company has been working on the technology for several years and is expected to launch it in the near future. The technology will use near-field communication (NFC) technology, which is the same technology used in contactless payment cards. When a customer wants to make a purchase, they will simply hold their hand over a payment terminal. The terminal will then read the customer's credit card information and complete the transaction. The technology is expected to be very secure, as it will use biometric authentication to verify the customer's identity. The technology is expected to be a major convenience for customers, as it will allow them to make purchases without having to carry their wallets or purses. It is also expected to be a boon for retailers, as it will make it easier for customers to make purchases."
Tsinghua,tldr-75,"Amazon is developing a technology that will allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands, allowing them to purchase items with their palms. The company has been working with French startup Spatiale to develop the technology, and a prototype has already been shown off to the press. Spatiale is developing the technology to create a portable credit card that can be carried on your person at all times, which can then be scanned by your phone to make purchases. The credit card will then transfer the information to your phone and Amazon will receive the information, and then charge the bill. Spatiale says that the credit card can be used for up to 100,000 purchases, which would allow for a long time of use. Spatiale is already working on a prototype for the technology, which is called Handycard. The prototype can be seen in the video below, and the company says that the credit card will have a chip and NFC technology. It will also be connected to your phone's NFC technology, so that it can be scanned. The company says that this technology is the next step in the evolution of payment. The idea is that it would allow people to carry the information they need for purchases with them, so that it is always available. This could also be a big step towards mobile payments, as it would allow people to make purchases without having to use a credit card, or even carry it. Amazon is expected to show off the technology at the Consumer Electronics Show next month, so it could be out sooner than later."
LLAMA,tldr-75,"Amazon is developing a technology that will allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands, allowing them to purchase items with their palms. The company has been working on the technology for the last few years and believes it could make the ""checkout experience easier for customers."" Amazon has applied for a patent for a non-contact biometric identification system that uses human skin as a ""communication path."" The system can identify individuals by detecting the unique electrical signals that are emitted by human skin. Customers would be required to input their credit card details into the system once, and then they would be able to make purchases with their hands. The information would be stored securely in a database and could be accessed by scanning the hands of the customer. Amazon is also developing systems that would allow people to use their hands to pay for purchases when they are not in the physical vicinity of a cash register. This is particularly useful for situations where customers are not able to access a computer, such as when they are shopping at a store that does not have a checkout counter. Amazon's ""contactless"" payment system could be used in other scenarios such as on public transport, where customers can touch a rail or bus to pay for their tickets. The system could also be used to help verify people's identity in places where identification is required, such as bars or airports. This isn't the first time that Amazon has been involved in developing unusual payment systems. In January, the company filed a patent for a payment system that uses selfies. The company's latest development is part of a growing trend of businesses that are developing innovative payment systems. Retailers in the US and China are now developing payment systems that allow people to pay for goods using only their faces. Last month, Walmart filed a patent for a system that would allow customers to pay for their purchases using their body movements. Amazon's latest patent shows that the company is still at the forefront of innovation in the online payment sector. The technology is likely to be highly sought-after by a number of businesses and could even be integrated into other retail systems such as paying with Bitcoin or Ethereum. This new system could also give Amazon a big advantage over other retailers in the future and could help to further solidify the company's dominance in the online retail sector.

When you think about mainstream payment systems such as PayPal or Venmo, what comes to mind? A virtual wallet holding your debit cards (or bank accounts) online just waiting to be used when needed? PayPal offers one form of electronic money called ""digital currency"" that's stored within each user account. Digital currencies are usually traded between users through peer-to-peer trading platforms where they can buy goods or services using either coins or fiat currency. When it comes to e-commerce merchants who accept PayPal transactions as part of their sales process, there can also be fees associated with accepting currency conversions based on exchange rates determined by market conditions rather than calculated internally. Fintech disruptors like Revolut - and other new players - have built up customer bases during the COVID-19 crisis Revolut was founded by Russian-born entrepreneur Alexander Menon back in 2010 while he studied economics at Oxford University. While studying, Alex began experimenting with alternative banking methods and found resistance towards traditional institutions among his fellow students - which led him to launch Revolut after deciding all banks were scammers. Like many fintech companies established right now due to remote work and lockdown restrictions, Revolut started out primarily serving high net worth individuals before expanding to include businesses earlier this year thanks to its innovative approach to fund transfers and international banking. According to the American Banker, Revolut currently processes over 23 billion annually in transactions worldwide; roughly half of those transactions come directly from consumer spending related to e-commerce purchases made via mobile devices."

OpenAI,tldr-75,"Amazon is developing a technology that will allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands, allowing them to purchase items with their palms. The company has been testing this technology, called Amazon One, in select Amazon Go stores in Seattle since 2020. With Amazon One, a customer would simply wave their hand over a scanner to pay for goods instead of having to use a credit card or cash. This technology uses a combination of computer vision algorithms and sensors to create a unique palm signature for each customer. This signature is securely stored and can be used to verify the customer's identity when making purchases. One of the benefits of Amazon One is that it could potentially reduce the need for physical contact when paying for goods, which could be particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some people have raised concerns about the use of biometric data, particularly if it is hacked or stolen. Amazon has stated that it takes privacy and security seriously and that the palm signature data is encrypted and kept secure. Customers can also delete their palm signature if they no longer want to use Amazon One.

Redis Functions Redis Functions add a new type of callable function to Redis. Redis Functions are functions that take and return strings. Redis Functions allow you to add an API layer to your Redis database. For example, you can define a Redis Function that adds a new row to a table in your database, and another Redis Function that displays a message when a row is added to a table. You can also use Redis Functions to perform logic on data. For example, you can use Redis Functions to implement a search engine.

Tsinghua,tldr-77,"The results of a Phase 1 trial to study the effects of microdosing LSD have been published. Researchers were testing whether microdosing psychedelics could be useful as a therapeutic approach for mental health issues. The research involved 21 participants, and the results were published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. The findings suggest that microdosing LSD does not appear to have any negative side effects. LSD is a psychedelic, and is one of the most popular and widely used hallucinogens in the world. It has been used for therapeutic purposes since the 1950s. Psychedelics are substances that alter the user's perception of time and space. They are usually prescribed to help patients overcome the negative effects of treatment for mental health issues. LSD was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958 as a treatment for depression. However, the drug has been on the list of banned substances in the United States since 1971, due to concerns that it could be abused. It was also classified as a Schedule I drug in the UK in 2001, due to the same concerns. However, the DEA dropped its classification of LSD in 2016, and it is now considered a Schedule II drug. Research has been conducted to determine whether LSD microdosing could be a potential alternative to conventional therapy. In the study, participants were given a 25-microgram dose of LSD in a single dose, or 25 micrograms over three consecutive days. They were asked to complete questionnaires and participate in a formal interview to evaluate the experience. The study found that LSD microdosing did not have any significant side effects. However, the researchers said they would have liked to see more data about participants' emotional state, as they did not collect this information. ""In terms of the potential to be used in a therapeutic setting, we would not want to advocate for microdosing in clinical practice until we have more evidence of safety, efficacy, and effectiveness,"" said the study's lead author Mikhail Shafir."

Researchers were testing whether microdosing psychedelics could be useful as a therapeutic approach for depression and anxiety. The study, conducted by UC Berkeley and UCSF researchers, was co-authored by James Fadiman, PhD, a psychedelics expert who had been leading a citizen science study on the effects of microdosing psychedelics. The study, published in the journal Neural Regeneration Research, involved 12 participants between the ages of 28 and 65. The study did not include a placebo control group, and it was not double-blinded, which is a limitation to the study. However, because the study was not a double-blind study, the researchers were able to follow up with participants after the study and learn more about their experiences. During the study, participants were asked to microdose LSD for a few weeks. A microdose of LSD is considered to be 10 to 20 micrograms, about 10 to 20 times less than a full dose of LSD. Microdosing psychedelics is thought to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. The goal of the study was to determine whether microdosing LSD could improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other conditions. The study also looked at whether there were any adverse effects associated with microdosing. Researchers determined that there were no adverse effects associated with microdosing. They also found that LSD microdosing was associated with improvements in depression, anxiety, and an increased sense of well-being and mood. The study showed that microdosing LSD was associated with long-lasting improvements in mood and well-being. Researchers found that participants experienced ""increased well-being, enhanced openness, and improved relationships."" They also reported a decrease in anxiety, depression, and stress. The findings were ""consistent with previous reports of the beneficial effects of psychedelic psychotherapy,"" the researchers wrote. However, they emphasized that the study is limited by its small sample size and lack of controls. ""More research is needed to validate these preliminary findings and to investigate the psychological and neurological mechanisms of action of LSD-assisted psychotherapy,"" they wrote.

HAMR-JR was built with several components that allow it to be both fast and safe. Its design allows it to turn on its side while running, allowing it to avoid obstacles, such as a blood vessel or a tissue wall. The robot also has a high-torque motor that allows it to move fast, while still having enough torque to turn when needed. The robot is also equipped with a mechanism to automatically deflate and inflate its pneumatic tires to regulate its speed. ""HAMR-JR is a really cool example of how we can design and build robots that can be safe inside the human body,"" said Barford.

This is because it's difficult and time-consuming to ask a lot of such specific questions. But according to one recent study by LinkedIn - which is touted as having some of the world's most influential professionals on its roster - it makes sense that you're not going to get paid what you want if your employer does not give you exactly what you need or expect. The survey found there was an average gap between what employees were being offered in terms of salary packages and how much they actually believe companies should be paying them. This means weeks, months and even sometimes years later when someone arrives at his or her new workplace with a top-notch resume and cover letter filled with idealized qualifications - like their degree from Harvard Business School or experience working in Goldman Sachs - he or she feels let down.

And don't waste your precious two minutes reading the rest of these 9 creative ways to earn extra money while still underemployed: According to The Huffington Post, you'll likely receive better pay than many other workers who choose part-time jobs simply because those positions offer less hours per week. For example, data compiled by PayScale reveals that engineers get the highest hourly wage rates, averaging 110 per hour. Meanwhile, dietitians make only 8 per hour (and jobs requiring college degrees often come with higher starting salaries). When looking for work elsewhere, think hard about whether you'd prefer a longer commute or fewer hours versus lower wages. If your current position doesn't allow you to do both things, try applying online for others where you might fit into such a scenario.

This is a mistake, as asking good questions can show that you are interested in the job and that you have done your research. It can also help you to get a better understanding of the company and the role you are applying for. Here are some tips for asking good questions in a job interview:  Do your research. Before the interview, take some time to research the company and the role you are applying for. This will help you to come up with more informed questions.  Be specific. Don't just ask general questions like ""What is the company culture like?"" or ""What are the benefits?"" Instead, ask questions that are specific to the role you are applying for. For example, you could ask about the company's growth plans, the specific responsibilities of the role, or the training and development opportunities that are available.  Be prepared to answer questions. The interviewer will also likely ask you some questions, so be prepared to answer them. This is your chance to sell yourself and to show the interviewer why you are the best person for the job.

LLAMA,tldr-79,"At every job interview, applicants are asked whether they have any questions for the company, but few people take the opportunity to find out more about their potential employers. This is a huge mistake. The best candidates are those who have taken the time to research the company, and also to have a number of questions prepared about the role and the company. Having questions shows you are genuinely interested in the company and the role, and have made an effort to find out more. It also shows you are a curious person with a proactive attitude, which is always a good thing. Here are some examples of what you could ask at your next job interview: What will my main responsibilities be? This is a great opening question that will help you understand what you will be doing in the job and what will be expected of you. What is the biggest challenge the team is facing right now? A question like this shows you are interested in the team and will give you an idea of what the business is struggling with and what you can do to help. What is the most important thing I can do to help the team in the first month? This will help you understand the company's expectations of you in your first month and gives you a chance to demonstrate you have the skills and knowledge to hit the ground running. What is the culture of the company? If you are leaving a toxic work environment, it is important to understand what the culture is like at your new employer. If you want to work in a relaxed office where you can wear jeans, then it is important to find out whether a formal dress code is expected. This is another important question to ask, particularly if you are looking to progress in your career. If the company offers training and development opportunities, you will be able to develop your skills and reach your full potential. What do you like about working for this company? Asking your interviewer about their personal experience of the company will give you a deeper insight into what it's like to work there. What is your vision for the company? Asking your interviewer about their vision for the future of the company shows you have a genuine interest in the organisation and want to know where it is going. What are the biggest challenges you have faced in this role? A question like this will give you an idea of what to expect from the role and any challenges you will face. Do you have any reservations about me or my qualifications? Asking this question will give you a chance to address any doubts the interviewer may have about you. Will you be offering any additional benefits? Questions like this will give you an insight into whether you will get extra perks and benefits, such as pension contributions, gym memberships or flexible working. Asking questions shows you are genuinely interested in the company and the role, and have made an effort to find out more. What are the next steps in the recruitment process? Asking about the next steps in the process will give you an indication of when you will hear back and the next stage. Do you have any feedback on my performance in the interview? A question like this will give you a chance to hear what you did well and what you could have done better in the interview, which will help you in future interviews. Is there anything else you need from me? It is always good to finish the interview on a positive note, and asking the interviewer if there is anything else you can help them with will give them the opportunity to ask you any questions they may have missed.

Tsinghua,tldr-80,"Many dog breeds are about appearance, but plenty of others are devoted to specific tasks. A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog breeds and their contributions to society. Some of the breeds were bred to be shepherds, falconers, and even pet guinea pigs. The research team was looking at how the breed of dog had an effect on the health and happiness of the dogs and their owners. They were also interested in whether or not certain breeds were more likely to bite people, and whether or not the dogs were happier than other breeds. The study was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, and they found that the health of the dogs is dependent on the breed. Dogs that were used for hunting and working were more likely to be healthy, while purebred dogs that were bred for beauty were less likely to be healthy. The study found that 41 percent of the 38 dog breeds studied had a higher rate of health issues, and 43 percent of the dogs had at least one problem. There was no relationship between the number of teeth in the dog and its health. The researchers also found that many breeds had a higher rate of bite injuries than others. The findings also showed that the overall health of dogs did not necessarily correlate with their happiness. Many of the breeds were not necessarily happier than others. There were certain breeds that were more likely to bite people, such as bulldogs and Great Danes. There were also a few breeds that were more likely to be sick, such as Jack Russell Terriers and Pekingese. The study was published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine. Breeds that were more likely to bite people include Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Bichon Frise, Boston Terrier, Great Dane, German Shorthaired Pointer, Jack Russell Terrier, Pug, Shar Pei, St. Bernard, West Highland White Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, Yorkshire Terrier, and Labrador Retriever. Breeds that were more likely to be healthy include Airedale Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Australian Shepherd, Basenji, Border Collie, Chow Chow, Dalmatian, Doberman Pinscher, English Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd Dog, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Maltese, Pit Bull Terrier, Rottweiler, Shih Tzu, Saint Bernard, Standard Poodle, and Toy Poodle. This is not to say that all dogs are happy, healthy dogs, but it is important to know what breeds are healthy and what breeds are less healthy. There are plenty of purebred dogs that are healthy, but that doesn't mean they are necessarily happy."
LLAMA,tldr-80,"Many dog breeds are about appearance, but plenty of others are devoted to specific tasks. A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog behaviors and personalities and found that these traits are genetically linked to the size and shape of their bodies. Dogs are known to have distinct personalities. Some are reserved and fearful, while others are outgoing and curious. These personality traits can be measured by trained observers, with the help of various tests. The study found a link between physical and behavioral traits in dogs. The team found that personality and appearance traits in dogs are linked to each other. For example, breeds like Siberian Huskies and Shetland Sheepdogs, which are known to be highly energetic and aggressive, are also usually highly motivated, independent, and persistent in their actions. The dogs were also divided into three personality groups. The researchers also divided the 18,000 dogs into three personality groups: fearful, aggressive, and socially bold. These groups were further linked to certain body shapes and sizes. For example, breeds like the Whippet and the Greyhound, which are known for their speed, are also less likely to be fearful than other dog breeds. They are also more likely to be aggressive or socially bold. The study found that brachycephalic breeds like Pugs are more aggressive and less fearful than most. Brachycephalic dogs are those with shortened skulls and muzzles, like Pugs, Bulldogs, and Pekingese. The results of the study give us a better understanding of the physical and behavioral traits of dogs. The researchers hope that the findings can also help dog breeders in creating new breeds that are well-suited to certain jobs and tasks. This study can also help us understand more about how physical and behavioral traits have evolved in dogs. Dogs that are aggressive or fearful are also more likely to be responsive to training. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Bristol, and the University of Oxford. Do you agree with the results of this study?

A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog behavior and find out which breeds were best at performing various duties.

It's worth noting that all these jobs have something in common: they require both intelligence (to recognize where an object is) and good physical stamina (for running after it). To evaluate how well each breed is suited for doing some particular job, there was used a standard scoring system with scores above 80 being considered excellent performers, 70-79 very good, 60-69 good, 50-59 fair, 40-49 poor, and 20-39 bad. The results revealed that German shepherds registered highest marks when compared against other popular dog breeds in 16 categories out of 17 tested.

It also said it would only approve Uber's self-flying taxi service in California. In the pilot program, Uber would use an aircraft with 12 seats, and would not charge passengers a fee. Uber's first partner in California is called Avitas, which is a company that is building a self-flying taxi service. The Uber-Joby partnership would be much more ambitious. It would use a 6-passenger aircraft, and charge passengers a fee. According to the job listing, Joby's flying taxi service would be based in Pittsburgh, and would offer 6-passenger, ""fully autonomous"" aircraft that could fly 200 miles at 120 mph. It would be similar to the Uber-Avistas plan, but much more ambitious. Uber would have to secure a long-term deal with a local airport. Joby would have to create a 6-passenger aircraft that could fly 200 miles at 120 mph. Uber has been working on its flying taxi service since 2016, when it launched its ""Apex"" project. It has been working on a small, two-seater aircraft. It also has been testing a larger, six-passenger aircraft. Uber has also tested the aircraft on a test track in Nevada, and has secured a permit to test it on public roads. But it has not been able to convince regulators to allow it to test it on public roads. Uber said in 2017 that it would ""explore"" partnerships with aircraft companies to create flying taxi services. The company has not had a lot of success in this regard."

Joby is the latest in a string of investments by Uber to achieve its goal of providing aerial ridesharing by 2023. The company has also invested in Kitty Hawk, a flying car startup. It has also partnered with NASA to develop a system to manage flying taxis. Uber has previously said that it would develop a network of on-demand aircraft to reduce traffic congestion in major cities. At a real estate conference in Los Angeles last November, Uber's head of product Jeff Holden said the company was working on ""vertical takeoff and landing"" vehicles, which would be ""both of those things, and unlocks another dimension in terms of mobility in cities.""

BigScience,tldr-84,"Bemisia tabaci is a whitefly that acquired a gene from its plant host millions of years ago, allowing it to neutralize a toxin that some plants produce to defend against insect herbivores. The toxin causes sickness and death in the pests. Now researchers have shown for the first time how one species of this tiny insect can take over whole groups of plants (actually doesn't really do much but they are all alike) by means of mimicking an essential part of their defense system: In a study published today in Nature Communications, scientists report on results obtained using Arabidopsis thaliana as test organisms - taken advantage of because A.thaliana has relatively few defenses associated with chewing insects compared with other plants such as cotton or tobacco. (Cotton was already known to make glucosinolates.) Scientists used transgenic Bemisia flavipennis, which has been engineered to synthesize higher levels of oxazolidinone-containing defenses than native B.tabaci. These artificially-enhanced defensive compounds protect A.thaliana lines from attacks made by another type of leaf feeding argiope bug called Argyrotaenia annuae. This work demonstrates what appears to be convergent evolution between two distantly related groups of arthropods - plants and beetles - after they've diverged more than 150 million years ago. A: According to Wikipedia, The primary defence mechanism responsible for deterring microbial attack is inducible, meaning that there must be chemical signals present (and possibly amounting to high concentrations) at the infection site before bacteria will initiate growth within leaves; however, even then not many pathogens appear capable of initiating growth. Inducible defences involve several key components, including members of the jasmonate and salicylic acid pathways. They may also include chitinases like myrosins. Most leaves contain antioxidants and phenolic compounds that inhibit bacterial enzymes directly Conclusions derived from these studies are: that different classes of secondary metabolites represent different defense strategies in order to control the same fungus that systemic signal molecules, i.e., jasmonic acid, might stimulate both local and long-distance production of antimicrobial metabolites, ... findings consistent with hypotheses advanced by Perreten et al. [20] showing that the overall level of resistance in plants depends upon the balance among induction mechanisms operating locally, inducing particular types of antifungals only near sites where they act effectively, and systemic ones, regulating biosynthesis at distant locations. For example salicylic acid increases the expression of a gen encoding beta-1-3-glucosidase [1921] However there's no evidence about the compatibility of systemic signalingdefense responses across kingdoms so I can't say whether it's relevant here"
LLAMA,tldr-84,"Bemisia tabaci is a whitefly that acquired a gene from its plant host millions of years ago, allowing it to neutralize a toxin that some plants produce to defend against insects. This whitefly is a major agricultural pest in the Middle East and Europe. Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Bemisia tabaci is a major agricultural pest worldwide and in particular in the Middle East and Europe. In the Middle East, the whitefly transmits viruses that have devastated populations of tomatoes, cucumbers and other crops. In Europe, the whitefly causes significant crop damage by sucking sap from the underside of leaves. In 2011, this whitefly was found in the United States for the first time. Currently, it has been detected in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Virginia, as well as in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. Because this whitefly is so destructive, researchers are keen to learn more about it. In particular, they want to know how it can feed on so many different plant species. How the whitefly feeds Like other herbivorous insects, B. tabaci feeds by sucking the fluids out of plant leaves, and as a result, plants have evolved to defend themselves against these pests. For example, some plants have developed toxins, such as salicylic acid, that are harmful to insects. Some insects have evolved a way to neutralize these plant toxins. One way they do this is by acquiring the genes responsible for producing these toxins from their plant host. By acquiring this gene, the insects are able to neutralize the toxins by producing the same salicylic acid compounds that the plant does. Scientists have found evidence that this has occurred in aphids, but until now, they had not found it in whiteflies. Now, researchers at the University of Illinois, including UChicago alumnus Hugh Robertson, PhD'91, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, have found that B. tabaci has acquired a gene from its plant host that allows it to neutralize salicylic acid toxins. Robertson and his team sequenced the DNA of B. tabaci and compared it to that of its plant hosts, Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato. They found that the whitefly had acquired a gene that allowed it to produce salicylic acid and neutralize the toxin. Their findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shed light on how this destructive insect is able to feed on so many different plant species.

Tsinghua,tldr-84,"Bemisia tabaci is a whitefly that acquired a gene from its plant host millions of years ago, allowing it to neutralize a toxin that some plants produce to defend against insects. The whitefly gene also protects the plant from the whitefly. This means the plant and the whitefly can co-exist. Studying these types of genes and the evolution of the whitefly could help researchers develop methods to fight insect pests that cause serious damage to plants and crops. ""Our goal is to use this whitefly gene as a tool to help us understand the evolution of whiteflies and their plant hosts,"" said the study's senior author, Thomas Doyle, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. ""This whitefly gene is a 'helper' gene, one that helps the whitefly and the plant to live together. We hope to use it to understand how helper genes have evolved in both plants and insects, and how they influence the evolution of the whole organism."" A model organism for studying evolution in plants and insects To study the evolution of the whitefly and its plant host, researchers used the tiny whitefly and the tomato, which is a common model organism for studying evolution in plants and insects. The researchers looked at the gene and the plant in an evolutionary context, comparing the gene to the genes in related species. The researchers found that the whitefly gene had acquired the ability to neutralize the plant's toxin from its host in only 15,000 years. They also found that this gene is present in only one other plant-associated insect, the Colorado potato beetle, and that the gene has only been acquired once in the history of the plant-associated insect lineage. ""This is the first time that an insect has acquired a gene that neutralizes a toxin from its host,"" said co-author Roberta Ransbottom, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona. ""We're very excited about the results, because it's the first time that an insect has acquired a gene that neutralizes a toxin from its host. That's a rare event, and it's also a very interesting one. It's interesting because this gene evolved from a gene that was already in the whitefly. It didn't evolve from a gene that was in the tomato."" To see how the whitefly gene has evolved in the past, the researchers studied its structure. They found that the whitefly gene contains several blocks of DNA that code for different parts of the protein that neutralizes the toxin. The researchers found that these blocks have changed in the whitefly's gene in a very specific way. The gene contains a particular type of block that is present in the gene in the Colorado potato beetle, but not in the gene in the tomato. The researchers think this block is what allowed the whitefly to acquire the gene that neutralizes the toxin from its host. The study was published today in the journal Cell. ""The way this gene has changed in the whitefly and the Colorado potato beetle is different from the way it's changed in all other plants-associated insects,"" said co-author Paul Tucker, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. ""This makes it a unique gene, and we think it's a really interesting gene. It's really exciting that this whitefly gene has a special property, that it neutralizes a toxin from its host. It's something that no other plant-associated insect has, so it's very interesting."" This research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health."

It's part of a wider crackdown on internet freedoms by the Communist Party, as they've blocked Instagram and WhatsApp as well. It seems the only Western social media company that's doing well in China is LinkedIn, as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram, WhatsApp, Bing, and many others have been blocked. China has blocked access to Bing, the Microsoft-owned search engine, across the country. In a statement to TechCrunch, the company confirmed the blockage, noting that it has been in touch with the Chinese government to understand the blockage. It's unclear why Bing has been blocked. China regularly blocks websites and services that are not in compliance with its strict censorship laws, or that it perceives to be a threat. Bing has been censored in China for years, so the blockage is unlikely to have been triggered by recent events. It's possible that China has opted to block Bing due to its close ties with Microsoft, which the Chinese government has been increasingly suspicious of in recent years. The blockage is a further blow to Microsoft, which recently saw its LinkedIn service become inaccessible to users in Russia. The service was blocked by the Russian government, which decided to ban LinkedIn because it failed to comply with a 2014 law that requires internet companies to store Russian user data in the country. Bing was never going to unseat Google as the top search engine, and a lot of that is due to China, the world's largest internet market. Google long ago pulled out of China, where Baidu has a massive lead over Google and Bing.

BigScience,tldr-90,"Google Cloud has made its first major acquisition under its new CEO, Thomas Kurian. Kurian, a former executive at Oracle, joined Google in November and had announced plans to expand the company's cloud services beyond data centers. The deal is with AppDynamics Inc., which provides software monitoring tools for apps running on mobile devices or servers. The two companies said their combined products will help enterprises more effectively monitor how well they're meeting goals and achieving desired results. ""We've built a legacy of building applications that are robust enough for enterprise use but also designed to be simple so that users can quickly adopt them,"" said David Carney, one of Armaganov's co-founders who led On-Site Security as it grew from an engineering group into a full-fledged business unit last year. AppDynamics may have been looking toward acquisitions before joining Google Cloud - In January, CNET reported that Apple's iPhone maker was considering buying the startup after failing to strike any deals with security vendors like Symantec Corp. (SYMC). But it's now focused solely on growing existing customers rather than entering markets completely new to it. Carey said he believes much of what makes AppDynamics successful stems from being able to work closely with clients by understanding not just the technology underlying some things (like deep learning) but ""what kind of impact we want our solutions to make. What do consumers' behaviors look like? How often does this happen? And should I even care about these kinds of activities if I'm going to charge you money? Kurian told CNBC earlier this month that while AppDynamiics had failed to reach the same successes as other startups he'd worked with previously, including Airbnb Inc. (ABNB), Lyft Inc.

Tsinghua,tldr-93,"This is a guide for moving from macOS to Linux. It discusses different distros, how to optimize battery life, and various other tweaks to the OS that can make transitioning to Linux as smooth as possible. It's not a complete guide, but it should get you started. macOS vs. Linux: What are the differences? The big difference between macOS and Linux is that macOS is a closed source operating system, whereas Linux is open source. This means that you can't access the source code to the macOS operating system, but you can access the source code to the Linux operating system. You also can't access the source code to macOS, but you can access the source code to Linux. There are a lot of differences between macOS and Linux. Most of these differences can be ignored if you are new to Linux. Installing macOS on a PC If you want to install macOS on a PC, you will need to install an Apple hardware certification program (or Apple ID), which is required for all Apple devices. Once you have an Apple ID, you can download macOS from the Mac App Store. Note: If you don't have an Apple ID, you can get one for free here. The only way to install macOS is to use a bootable USB or DVD. You can create bootable USB or DVD with BootCamp. Installing Linux on a PC If you want to install Linux on a PC, you can do it with the standard installers. You can download the installer for your favorite Linux distribution from the distribution's website. You will need to have an account on the distribution's website. You can use a different account for the Linux distribution, or you can create an account for your new Linux distribution. Creating a Linux distribution account can be very useful if you want to use that distribution for more than one computer. If you want to use the same account for multiple computers, you can create a single account and have all your computers use that account. When you download an installer for your Linux distribution, you will be able to select the location where you want to save the installer. You can download the installer to the desktop, a USB stick, or a DVD. Installing Linux on a Mac If you want to install Linux on a Mac, you can use the standard installers. You can download the installer for your favorite Linux distribution from the distribution's website. You will need to have an account on the distribution's website.

It discusses different distros, how to optimize battery life, and various other tweaks to the OS that can make transitioning to Linux smoother. 1. Choose a Linux distribution: There are many distributions of Linux to choose from. Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian are popular choices for beginners. 2. Install Linux: Once you have chosen which distribution you want to use, you can download it from their website and follow the installation instructions. 3. Customize the interface: Linux is highly customizable, so you can tailor the interface to your preferences. You can change the themes, icons, and fonts, to name a few. 4. Optimize battery life: To optimize battery life on your laptop, you can install TLP (or equivalent) which is a power management tool. It can help to reduce energy consumption and prolong battery life. 5. Install necessary applications: Some software that you used on macOS may not be available on Linux. But don't worry, similar applications exist on Linux. For instance, you can use LibreOffice in place of Microsoft Office. 6. Learn the command line: Linux uses the Terminal, which is the command-line interface. To become proficient in Linux, it's good to learn basic commands. 7. Get familiar with package managers: Linux also uses package managers, which let you manage software installations easily. Ubuntu uses the apt package manager, while Fedora uses dnf. 8. Understand permissions: Linux uses a permission system to regulate access to files and directories. There are three types of users on Linux - the owner of the file, the members of the group, and others. 9. Get involved in the Linux community: Linux has a vast community of users who contribute to the development of the operating system. You can get help from forums and participate in open-source projects, etc. By following these tips, you can make a smooth transition from macOS to Linux. Ultimately, Linux offers a lot of benefits, including more customization, greater security, and freedom."

LLAMA,tldr-94,"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two of the most notable features that the company is exploring are an inward fold and a vertically foldable phone. Both designs were found in a patent filed by Samsung back in April of 2017. In the filing, they show a phone with an outward fold and a phone with a vertically foldable phone. The outward fold, as you can imagine, folds outward, much like the current Galaxy Fold. The outward fold seems to be very similar to the current Galaxy Fold, just a bit smaller and more compact. The vertically foldable phone is a bit different. It looks like a normal phone with a regular screen on the front. When it is unfolded, the hinge is in the middle, and the screens are on both sides of the hinge. This design could be good for a phone with two screens, a gaming phone, or a phone with two different views. Both of these concepts are just ideas for now, but we could see these folds on a Samsung phone in the near future. Source: GalaxyClub via 9to5Google"
OpenAI,tldr-94,"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two main areas that they are focusing on are the durability of the screen and the design of the hinge mechanism. The goal is to create a more robust and reliable device that can withstand daily use and wear and tear. One of the ideas that Samsung is exploring is the use of flexible glass instead of plastic for the foldable screen. This could make the screen more scratch-resistant and durable, which would be a significant improvement over the current model. In addition, Samsung is also looking at improving the hinge mechanism to make it more user-friendly and less prone to breaking. Some potential solutions include using a more durable material for the hinge or designing it in a way that is less likely to pinch or damage the screen. Overall, Samsung is committed to making the foldable phone a more practical and useful device for consumers. As they continue to receive feedback and work on new designs, we can expect to see even more impressive and innovative technologies in the near future."
BigScience,tldr-94,"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two new concept renderings have been revealed of what Samsung could be planning for a future version of its smartphone. The company's latest renders are unconfirmed leaks, so it might not necessarily turn out to be an official product at all or even close to being released in any form before many more years down the line. The two images show a design with some similarities to those seen earlier this year when Samsung came up with ideas about how they thought the next-gen Galaxy S phones should look like. As reported by Android Police, both screen prototypes display an external clamshell-style folds along the sides which would allow users to open them using either one side (the left) or the other (right). This is quite different than what we saw when Samsung unveiled their original idea for the double-folding Galaxy Z Flip - instead, it's reminiscent of Sony's Xperia Z4 model. While these early renderings don't offer much detail beyond the overall shape, if you're familiar with Samsung mobile products you can probably guess what's going inside. According to previous reports, the internal build of the second-generation Galaxy Fold will likely feature three displays - including a flat 4-inch OLED panel on the outside as well as an 8-inch flexible AMOLED layer inside.

PaLM,tldr-94,"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two of the most interesting include a clamshell design that folds in half, like the Motorola Razr, and a horizontal book-like design with two displays. The clamshell design is similar to the Motorola Razr, but it has a larger outer display and a smaller inner display. The outer display is said to be 6.2 inches, while the inner display is 4.6 inches. The phone is expected to have a Snapdragon 855 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. It's also expected to have a triple-lens rear camera and a 10MP front-facing camera.

Human,tldr-94,"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two design ideas have been leaked, one that is a clamshell-like device and another that folds outwards, similar to Huawei's Mate X. The new devices will be unveiled later this year or early next year and may have an extra screen on the outside, depending on the reception of a similar display on the Galaxy Fold. While Samsung works on these devices, they are still figuring out ways to improve on the current Galaxy Fold phone, as the device has an issue where a crease will appear on the panel after it has been folded 10,000 times."

BigScience,tldr-96,"Listen Notes is a podcast search engine and database which was built without a lot of engineers and is based on easily accessible technology. Instagram was acquired by Facebook for approximately 1 billion in 2012, making it one of the world's most valuable brands. The best videos are also found more quickly than ever before as there are now an estimated 1.8 billion users using YouTube every month - that's almost two-thirds of all internet users! The U.S. government even approved Google to build its own national cable system to distribute high-speed broadband Internet connections at low prices across the nation (although they still haven't done so yet). And with multi-screen apps like Netflix becoming increasingly popular, we're hearing that consumers will be watching their favorite shows on multiple devices simultaneously next year. For example, if you scroll through your sales emails from last week or see something interesting about someone who just signed up for your newsletter, click them out of curiosity and then find yourself scrolling past other email messages afterward. If you're curious about what else you can do with email marketing, check out our post below! According to HubSpot's research, when people read emails sent by companies they already trust, such as Amazon, Pinterest, and Uber, 93 increase their likelihood of clicking links within those emails. That means it's easier than ever for marketers to get new customers to sign-up because these businesses know how important relationships are. Nowadays, nearly 86 of brands use video content throughout their digital campaigns according to a study conducted by Marketing Land researchers. This may seem surprising considering only 8 believe visuals drive customer engagement above audible materials. However, this same study revealed that visual material generated over twice as many conversions compared to text-based content. Video creates strong emotional bonds between viewers and brands; 96 say they want to watch ads featuring real human voices instead of celebrity voiceovers. In addition, storytelling techniques and narratives create deeper levels of comprehension while allowing recipients to pause, rewind, skip around, etc., meaning information is being processed much faster Gone are the days where business owners were forced into creating websites that looked terrible due to limitations set forth by hosting providers such as Unbounce, Weebly, Wix, and Squarespace. These platforms typically offer limited customization options, poor communication tools, and insufficient resources to help design sites that actually engage visitors. Today, however, businesses no longer need to limit themselves to boring templates; rather, they can choose the platform that fits their needs better: WordPress vs Shopify vs SquareSpace vs Site Builder More. WordPress has remained one of the top-ranking CMS software programs used by web designers and developers worldwide since 2005. It provides endless opportunities for agencies and clients alike to work together towards building beautiful online stores, blogs, portfolios, and landing pages. Plus, you'll gain access to thousands of plugins created by third parties to seamlessly add features needed for specific purposes or preferences. In fact, WordPress offers unlimited possibilities thanks to lots of plug-ins and themes available online that allow functionality tailored specifically to each project and client's target audience - not everyone wants visually-pleasing website designs, but some prefer functional ones too. Shopify is another easy-to-use eCommerce platform that allows sellers to manage inventory, pricing strategies, shipping, payment gateways, product descriptions, and order tracking. Many e-commerce merchants opted for Shopify over other e-shopping solutions because of ease-of-use. For instance, if you're looking for a simple blogging tool that's compatible with mobile browsers, consider Blogger."

Tsinghua,tldr-98,"Distrobox creates fully mutable containers in environments where the file system is immutable or where the user doesn't have privileges to modify the host. Distrobox can be used to run a program within a container, but it can also be used to isolate any set of processes within a container. This includes processes that have been launched by another program (such as a program that creates a container or an OS-level init system) as well as those launched by the user (for example, when running a program with the privileged' option). Distrobox does not allow the user to specify any arbitrary environment variables, nor does it allow the user to specify any arbitrary program executables. The container environment is always fully reproducible and the user has full control over what programs are run and what files are written. To use Distrobox, create a directory to be used as a container, and place the source code in that directory. Next, create a container image from the directory using 'docker build'. "" 'bash docker build -t mycontainer . "" ' This creates an image that can be used to run a container from. If the user has Docker installed, the user can run the container by using the command 'docker run -it mycontainer'. This will start a container from the image, wait until it is ready, and then connect to the container via an in-process network. For more information on using Docker with Distrobox, see the [Docker documentation] . For more information on running processes inside containers, see the [container documentation] (containers.md). In the box and in the cloud Distrobox is designed to run inside of containers and is supported by many container platforms, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Mesos. It can also run on a machine with a standard Linux operating system (for example, a Linux machine with the 'libcontainer' package installed)."
Eleuther-AI,tldr-98,"Distrobox creates fully mutable containers in environments where the file system is immutable or where the user doesn't have privileges to modify the host. Distrobox can be used to run Docker as root, because it works by creating a new container with all of its files on top and then deleting that original image after running your application within an isolated filesystem environment created at runtime from scratch each time you need access; this guarantees isolation even if some other process already has mounted etcmtab inside one directory (like cgroups).

OpenAI,tldr-100,"This article covers five common types of tech interview questions. They include trivia-type questions, questions asking about technical specifics, questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording, and questions with unspecified behavior or requirements. 1. Trivia-type questions: These are typically general knowledge questions about the technology or programming language being used that may not necessarily measure a candidate's technical expertise or problem-solving skills. Examples include ""What was the first programming language ever created?"" or ""Who is the founder of Java?"" 2. Questions asking about technical specifics: These are more specific questions that assess whether the candidate has practical experience with a specific technology or programming language. Examples include asking a Java developer about the differences between abstract classes and interfaces, or asking a network engineer about the OSI model. 3. Questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording: These types of questions are intentionally vague or confusing so that the interviewer can see how the candidate reacts and solves the problem. For instance, an interviewer might ask a candidate to design a system for a ""hotel booking website."" This question doesn't have a clear scope or requirements, so the candidate will need to ask clarifying questions to get more information before providing a solution. 4. Questions with unspecified behavior or requirements: These types of questions ask the candidate to design or solve for a scenario that hasn't been completely defined. For instance, an interviewer might ask a candidate to design a system that can handle ""millions of users."" The candidate will need to provide clarifications on what the system will be used for, how users will interact with it, and other details in order to provide an effective solution. 5. Behavioral questions: These questions assess a candidate's soft skills and ability to work in a team. Examples include ""Describe a time when you had a conflict with a coworker and how you resolved it"" or ""How do you handle working under pressure?"" These questions don't have a straightforward technical answer but can give a good indication of how the candidate will behave in the workplace."
LLAMA,tldr-100,"This article covers five common types of tech interview questions. They include trivia-type questions, questions asking about technical specifics, questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording, and questions with unspecified behavior or edge cases. The best way to prepare for technical interviews is to practice solving technical problems and reviewing technical concepts. But no matter how much you practice, the technical interview questions you'll actually get will surprise you. In my experience, there are a few common types of tech interview questions. Let's take a look at some of them and consider strategies for answering them. Above all else, remember to breathe. There are lots of reasons for taking a deep breath. Deep breaths can help you calm down and think about the question. They can help you make sure you understand the question and that you're getting what the interviewer is asking. They can help you buy time and formulate a response. If you're in an in-person interview, you can also take a sip of water. This is a great way to buy yourself a few seconds to formulate a response. In-person interviews can be a little nerve-wracking, and having a little water to drink can help you get through the interview. Different types of interview questions have different strategies. Trivia-type questions are often used to help an interviewer assess your familiarity with a technology. For example, you might be asked to describe the differences between two programming languages. In this situation, you have two strategies. One is to try to answer the question directly. The other is to try to dodge the question. If you're able to answer the question directly, great! Just answer the question. If you don't know the answer, it's okay. In some cases, it's better to admit that you don't know the answer to a question than to try to make something up. If you're unable to answer the question directly, you can try to dodge it. You can reframe the question or ask a question back to get more information. In this situation, you're trying to get back on solid ground so you can answer the question. For example, you might be asked a question about which version of a library to use. In this situation, you can ask a question back. You can try to get more information on why the interviewer is asking the question, what the priorities are, and what the tradeoffs are. In some cases, the interviewer is looking for a specific answer. In other cases, the interviewer is trying to assess how you think about tradeoffs. Questions asking about technical specifics are often used to help an interviewer assess your ability to think about how different parts of a system work together. In many cases, you can get more information by asking questions back. You might ask about specific use cases or business requirements. In many cases, it's okay to ask the interviewer to clarify a question. The interviewer might be using terminology that you're not familiar with. If you are familiar with the question, you can answer it directly. If you're not familiar with the question, you can ask the interviewer to rephrase the question.

They include trivia-type questions, questions asking about technical specifics, questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording, and questions with unspecified behavior or outcomes. Tech Job Interview Questions: How to Answer Trivia-Type Tech Job Interviews are designed specifically for people who have deep knowledge on a particular subject matter, as opposed to general job interviews where the interviewee may be asked more open ended tasks, such as explaining yourself in 15 seconds. Answering these questions is one way that you can highlight your experience, skills, and qualifications - which will help you stand out from other candidates for similar positions. Here's how to answer them effectively (and confidently!) using our 5-step guide. If there are only two possible answers, then ask if it's not offered by anyone else within your organization. If someone has already chosen this option but can't justify why they chose it over another candidate, try changing the question slightly. When seeking an entry-level position at a startup company, companies often focus their attention on employees' understanding of coding concepts. On the flip side, companies looking for senior developers might look for proof of extensive development experience outside of programming languages like HTMLCSSJavaScript. Interviewers want to see whether applicants can solve problems independently without being told what to do first.. For example ""How would you go around solving problem X?"" vs ""What should we do next when faced with this kind ... What are the three main challenges I face every day? To get through an interview successfully, knowing some basic computer science questions is essential. In fact, just know a few things before going into any conversation regarding technology. But don't worry - even though these topics aren't exactly easy to understand, you won't need much background information to succeed! Developers are typically tasked with creating software apps which serve different purposes across industries. There are various tools used during the process of building mobile applications, web-based solutions and desktop programs. In order to make sure you're well prepared ahead of time no matter what industry you're entering, here are 25 popular interview questions you could be asked based on your career path andor responsibilities: Technical hiring managers sometimes use trick questions to assess prospective engineers.

Tsinghua,tldr-100,"This article covers five common types of tech interview questions. They include trivia-type questions, questions asking about technical specifics, questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording, and questions with unspecified behavior or side effects. Each of these types of questions is covered in depth, and the techniques and skills that can be applied to these types of questions are discussed. 1. Trivial Questions Trivial questions are questions that are very simple to answer and therefore difficult to test. However, they are often the first questions asked, and the interviewee will be expected to have a very strong grasp of the subject matter. A trivial question is usually a simple yesno question, such as: Do you know how to solve the following problem? (N 5, M 3, D 2) Does the answer to the following problem exist? (M D) The answer to a trivial question is either ""yes"" or ""no."" There is no gray area. You don't have to know how to solve the problem to know whether the answer is yes or no. It is common to ask trivial questions because they are easy to test and can be given to candidates quickly. However, because they are easy to test, trivial questions can be difficult to use to evaluate a candidate. A candidate may know the answer to a trivial question but may not be able to explain why the answer is correct or incorrect. It is not uncommon for a candidate to know the answer to a trivial question, but the candidate may not be able to articulate the process or reasoning behind the answer. Trivial questions can be a way to quickly determine if a candidate is knowledgeable about a particular topic. However, because they are easy to test, they do not provide much insight into the candidate's understanding of the topic. You should use these questions sparingly, and in addition, you should spend more time interviewing the candidate on other topics. You may not be able to use a trivial question to get a sense of the candidate's ability to communicate and articulate a technical idea. 2. Technical Specific Questions Technical specifics questions are questions that are about a specific piece of technology, and they ask the candidate to provide details about the technology. The specific questions may be: How does this technology work? How does this technology compare to other technologies? What is the difference between this technology and this other technology? Technical specifics questions are usually technical questions that can be answered by referring to a technical document or website. For example, a candidate might be asked how the Java Servlet works. This question could be answered by referring to the Java Servlet specification. However, this question would not be able to be answered by a simple yesno question. A simple yesno question would not provide any insight into the candidate's understanding of the subject. 3. Fuzzy Questions Fuzzy questions are questions that do not provide a clear answer. For example, you may be asked, ""What is the difference between the Unix bin and the Windows bin?"" This question is fuzzy because it does not provide a clear answer. It is possible that the candidate can answer the question, but the answer is not certain. For example, it is possible that the candidate knows that the Windows bin directory contains bincmd.exe and that the Unix bin directory contains binsh. However, it is possible that the candidate is incorrect and does not know the answer. Fuzzy questions are often asked to determine if a candidate is a good fit for the job. Fuzzy questions can be a good way to determine if a candidate can communicate clearly and concisely about technical concepts. Fuzzy questions can also be a good way to determine if a candidate is knowledgeable about a specific topic. However, it is important to remember that fuzzy questions are not a good way to determine the candidate's technical knowledge. 4. Behavior Questions Behavior questions are questions that have an unspecified behavior or side effects. For example, you may be asked, ""What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and a procedural programming language?"" This question is behavior because it does not specify any behavior. The answer to the question may be ""the difference between the C programming language and the C programming language."" This answer is not necessarily correct, and the answer may not be completely correct. It is possible that the candidate knows the answer to the question, but the candidate is incorrect and does not know the answer. Behavior questions are good for determining if a candidate is knowledgeable about a topic. However, they are not a good way to determine if the candidate can communicate clearly and concisely about technical concepts. 5. Unspecified Behavior Questions Unspecified behavior questions are questions that have unspecified behavior or side effects. For example, you may be asked, ""What is the difference between the C programming language and the C programming language?"""

When tech companies first started transporting employees from San Francisco to their offices in Silicon Valley, the shuttles were small and were considered a novelty. But now, they are huge and take workers from San Francisco to Silicon Valley and even further. Google runs 62 shuttles, Apple has 18, and Facebook has 24. The shuttles have become a symbol of the tensions that exist between tech and the neighborhoods of San Francisco. The shuttles are said to take up space that could be used by public transportation, and there is controversy over the price of the use of public bus stops for the shuttles. In a New York Times article, a real estate agent in San Francisco says that the shuttles are helping to bring more tech workers to the city.

When tech companies first started offering these shuttle buses, they were seen as a perk for employees, providing them with a comfortable and convenient way to get to work. However, they have also been criticized for causing gentrification, driving up housing costs and displacing low-income residents. As a helpful assistant, I suggest being mindful of the impact of these shuttle buses on the community and discussing potential solutions with the company and community leaders. This could include efforts to support affordable housing initiatives and public transportation options, as well as promoting responsible and sustainable corporate social responsibility practices."
PaLM,tldr-102,"Tech companies are operating shuttle buses that go all the way to the Central Valley as more and more tech employees move into the area. When tech companies first started moving to the Bay Area, they were primarily located in San Francisco. However, as the cost of living in San Francisco has skyrocketed, many tech companies have started to move to the East Bay and South Bay. This has led to an increase in the number of tech employees living in the Central Valley, which is located about an hour from San Francisco. In order to make it easier for their employees to commute to work, many tech companies are now operating shuttle buses that run from the Central Valley to their offices in the Bay Area. These buses typically pick up employees in the morning and drop them off at work in the evening. The cost of the bus ride is often subsidized by the company, making it a more affordable option for employees who live in the Central Valley. The shuttle buses have been a positive addition to the community, providing a much-needed transportation option for tech employees who live in the Central Valley. They have also helped to reduce traffic congestion in the Bay Area by taking cars off the road."

When tech companies first started arriving in the Valley, there was little transportation infrastructure to support the growth. Lawmakers created the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern California to take on the task of building new roads and building out the rail system. But that has all changed in the past few years, as the number of people who work in the Valley has soared. In fact, the number of people who commute to the Valley has tripled since 2008. According to a report from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people who live in the Inland Empire and commute to jobs in the Valley jumped from 176,000 in 2008 to 552,000 in 2018. That is an increase of 135 percent. ""I think it's amazing how many people are coming in,"" said Jerry Dias, a former San Francisco city supervisor and U.S. Secretary of Labor.

OpenAI,tldr-103,A lab-created microbe with fully redesigned DNA was created by scientists in Cambridge. The modified Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria contained a genetic code that had been trimmed by scientists That's interesting news. Do you have any other details about this scientific breakthrough?
Human,tldr-103,"A lab-created microbe with fully redesigned DNA was created by scientists in Cambridge. The modified Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria contained a genetic code that had been trimmed by scientists to remove superfluous information. More than 18,000 edits were made to the genetic code, resulting in a bacteria that was longer and grew more slowly than normal. This research could pave the way to create more virus-resistant organisms. Bacteria such as E coli are used to create medicines such as insulin, and entire production lines are wiped out if a virus is somehow introduced to the environment."
Tsinghua,tldr-103,"A lab-created microbe with fully redesigned DNA was created by scientists in Cambridge. The modified Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria contained a genetic code that had been trimmed by scientists at the University of Cambridge. The DNA had been ""recoded"" by replacing every codon with its shortest possible sequence, the researchers reported in the journal Nature. Scientists had previously been able to recode E coli with the same codons, but in a different order, the researchers said. ""This is a first for genetic engineering,"" said study leader Matthew Hancock, a molecular biologist at the University of Cambridge. ""We have now proven that it is possible to modify the genetic code of a living organism to make it produce a desired protein."" It's possible to create modified organisms with desired traits, Hancock said. However, the process has been complicated because the genetic code is so complex. He said that in order to do it, researchers would need to rewrite an organism's entire genome, the set of instructions that specify its biological functions. ""It's much easier to recode the DNA in the lab and then introduce the new DNA into a living cell,"" Hancock said. ""It's a way of working around the problem."" To create the E coli bacteria, the researchers replaced every codon with the shortest possible sequence of four letters. The four-letter code for amino acids was changed so that every codon would specify an amino acid with the shortest possible sequence of four letters. The recoded E coli was engineered to produce a protein that binds to a target protein. This interaction was known to cause cancer cells to die, and the protein's design was based on that of a protein that is used in chemotherapy. The researchers reported that the E coli bacteria produced the protein and that it did bind to the target protein. However, they said, the recoded protein was unstable and was not produced in significant amounts. ""This is a first for genetic engineering,"" said study leader Matthew Hancock, a molecular biologist at the University of Cambridge. ""We have now proven that it is possible to modify the genetic code of a living organism to make it produce a desired protein."" [Video: Microbe Evolves to Produce Protein That Kills Cancer Cells] The researchers also found that the E coli bacteria did not produce a significant amount of the protein in the lab. However, they said, this may be because they did not use the right culture conditions. They also did not study how the recoded E coli bacteria behaved in the lab. It's possible that they would have grown normally, the researchers said. Hancock said that the scientists are currently trying to engineer E coli that produce the protein at a higher rate. They also are working on creating E coli that produces the protein in higher amounts. They are also studying how the protein works. The findings are reported in the July 23 online edition of the journal Nature."

BigScience,tldr-103,"A lab-created microbe with fully redesigned DNA was created by scientists in Cambridge. The modified Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria contained a genetic code that had been trimmed by scientists to make it easier for them to study the genes and proteins inside. ""This is not new,"" said Dr Mary Jo Foley at Harvard Medical School who has worked on this type of research since 2001 when she first started working in the laboratory of Howard Hughes Medical Institute founder Robert Karchmer. ""But it's really exciting because we can now manipulate these synthetic organisms so much more easily than they used to be able to be manipulated before. This capability opens up all sorts of possibilities that were previously unimaginable. We could do things like change their metabolism or add specific chemicals into their genomes for testing purposes. It's an amazing level of control over those molecules you can't even imagine right now. It will bring us closer to understanding how life works."" Foley's group began studying E coli cells as part of her doctoral work while still at Yale University. At that time they extracted some parts from the cell - its nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria - which are cellular components made mostly out of fat-soluble substances such as lipids and carbohydrates. She then added other materials back in place of what had gone missing. That process allows researchers to see exactly where one particular chemical comes from within a complex molecule. By doing this analysis, scientists have gained insights about how different versions of RNA polymers interact with each other and how protein production occurs versus synthesis. Although there are many variants of naturally occurring RNA polymerase enzymes, only two known types use c-di-GMP as a template along with ATP, another common energy source used in living systems, to produce mRNA. Once synthesized, DnaA acts similar to ribosomes; it binds to a special kind of messenger called premRNA and starts transcribing the information encoded therein using a sequence-specific priming mechanism. In addition to this, DnaB, another component needed for transcription initiation, also undergoes thermal denaturation once bound to pre-mRNA. When TFIIH gets activated later during the reaction cycle, a cascade begins unfolding reactions until complete gene expression takes precedence. The collaboration between Foley's team and Wyss-Coray's artificial intelligence platform essentially allowed computers to decode the signals being sent through the genome, replacing the laborious task of manually pulling apart genes and chromosomes. Using algorithms built especially for machine learning tools, Wyss-Coray showed that nine percent of the coding regions in E.-coli lie outside standard promoters and introns defined by Watson and Crick's famed double helix theory. ""Technology helps us to find things faster and better but ultimately technology doesn't replace people,"" says Foley. ""The key here is having someone skilled enough to understand the biology behind the data generated by computer science and figure out why certain patterns emerge. Our next step are human-in-the-loop experiments, looking at whole organism behavior instead of just isolated genes and proteins. These decisions must come from biologists working alongside our computational models."""
LLAMA,tldr-103,"A lab-created microbe with fully redesigned DNA was created by scientists in Cambridge. The modified Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria contained a genetic code that had been trimmed by scientists to remove ""redundancies."" In the process they added two extra letters or ""bases"" to the four already found in the DNA of all life on Earth. The result is a world-first living organism with a partially synthetic genetic code. ""What we have now is the most radically altered genetic code that has ever been created in a living organism,"" said Farren Isaacs, an assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at Yale University, who helped to write the study. The new ""alien"" lifeform is made from existing genetic code, but scientists hope to create organisms with totally synthetic genomes in the future. The hope is that the new organisms will be better able to survive the effects of climate change or help to produce new drugs, for instance. Synthetic genomes could also be used to create new biotechnologies that could help to reduce the effects of climate change. One of the ideas put forward involves using bacteria to turn carbon dioxide into liquid fuels. However, more research is needed before a synthetic genome could be used to engineer such a technology, Isaacs said."

It has 100 GPU-accelerated servers, which use the new Nvidia V100 Tensor Core GPUs. The supercomputer is installed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is operated by the National Science Foundation. It's been used to conduct a Deep Learning Survey, which looks at how galaxies in the universe have changed over the past seven billion years. The survey used a method called gravitational lensing, which uses the gravity of massive objects to bend light. It's then used to help astronomers understand how the universe has changed over the years. The survey studied 2,300 galaxy clusters. This has resulted in an enormous amount of data that needs to be processed. The supercomputer has 100 GPUs, which makes it one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world. ""Science is always about pushing the boundaries of knowledge,"" said Alan Dabney, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ""I think deep learning is going to be an extremely powerful tool that we can use to analyze astronomical data. The scale of the data that astronomers produce is gigantic, and we have to cope with that somehow."" ""The promise of using GPUs in combination with deep learning algorithms to analyze huge datasets is great, and this is particularly exciting for me as an astronomer,"" he added. The data for the survey is collected using the Dark Energy Survey, which is a 570-megapixel camera that is located on a telescope in Chile. The survey is named after dark matter and dark energy, which is believed to make up 95 of the universe. ""Perlmutter will allow scientists to analyze huge datasets in a fraction of the time that it would take with slower systems,"" said Sharan Bruhadeshwar, a researcher at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. ""The time saved in the data analysis will mean more time for the science itself, a change that will have ripple effects across many areas of discovery.""

The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding the mixture by an automated process called continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) fermentation. The team used the CO2 produced from coal-fired power plants or biomass as feedstock for their system. They have produced more than 10 tons of acetate in 150 hours with no need for light. According to co-author Yekaterina Pirogova of MSU, ""The results show that it is possible to produce this chemical compound on-site at low costs using green energy technologies such as CSP and sustainable gasification."""
LLAMA,tldr-105,"A group of researchers has developed a way to create food without sunlight using artificial photosynthesis. The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding it to bacteria which produce protein. The process is not quite efficient enough to be used on a large scale yet, but the researchers believe that with a bit of optimization it will be possible. Two features set this system apart from other methods of creating food. The first is that it does not need sunlight, meaning that it could be used in space. The second is that it can create protein, which is the most difficult nutrient to find in space. The researchers also believe that the system could be used to create food in places where sunlight is scarce, such as in the Arctic. The conversion of carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate is a form of artificial photosynthesis. It involves using two electrodes to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon dioxide, and the resulting mixture is converted into acetate. The acetate is then fed to bacteria which convert it into proteins and other nutrients. The system is not yet efficient enough to be used on a large scale, but the researchers believe that it will be possible to make it efficient enough eventually. They also think that it could be used to grow vegetables in places where sunlight is not plentiful enough for plants to grow."

Tsinghua,tldr-105,"A group of researchers has developed a way to create food without sunlight using artificial photosynthesis. The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding the acetate into bacteria to produce biomass, as reported in a recent issue of Nature Communications. The scientists hope that their approach will help them produce organic compounds with less environmental impact, in less time, and at a lower cost than current methods. ""To put this in perspective, we're producing a food that's roughly equivalent to the amount of food that you could produce in a year if you harvested all of the biomass from the plant world, like a field of corn, and fed it to cattle, then ate that meat,"" says Vincent Gratton, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But the benefits of this method are much greater, because you don't have to grow that plant world, and you don't have to harvest it and eat it."" The researchers started with two-component cobalt-iron catalysts, which are typically used to convert sunlight into oxygen, but which can also be used to convert carbon dioxide into acetate. The researchers added an enzyme that catalyzes the production of acetate from water, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. To create the acetate, the researchers first split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Then, they used a light source to trigger the reaction between the cobalt-iron catalysts and the enzyme to create acetate. The researchers tested their method using solar-powered, artificial photosynthesis, but Gratton says that their method is just as effective when electricity is provided by a battery or by the sun. He adds that their method can also be used to produce biomass without oxygen, such as butane or methanol, using catalysts made of platinum and iridium. Gratton and his team have previously demonstrated that artificial photosynthesis can be used to convert carbon dioxide and water into hydrogen and oxygen, which can then be used to fuel an electric motor. In this case, the researchers used the motor to power a light source, which in turn created the hydrogen and oxygen from the water and carbon dioxide. But they say that the process of converting the water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen and oxygen is too inefficient to be useful. They believe that the process will work best when carbon dioxide and water are used to produce acetate, which can then be fed into bacteria to produce biomass. ""This is a much better system, because you don't have to produce oxygen from water, and you don't have to produce hydrogen from water and carbon dioxide,"" Gratton says. Gratton says that the team has already started to scale up their system, and that they are now focusing on developing an inexpensive method for creating the cobalt-iron catalysts. ""We're trying to make the process more scalable, more economically viable, and more efficient,"" he says."

BigScience,tldr-108,"Using private backend servers for small projects that need to use a database can become annoying. Hosting a static website is much easier. There are many free and reliable options, all of which will work fine on your needs. DNS is the Internet equivalent of an address book. It maps domain names like or into IP addresses such as PI:IPADDRESS so web browsers can understand where they should send requests. DNS records contain information about resource blocks hosted by different sites in the internet. Once you have multiple domains, having accurate DNS entries takes time and effort. However if you're running WordPress using one site (or even two), it's easy enough just to add the secondary domain name you want visitors to see when they type it in their browser. One thing I do recommend doing before moving forward with this strategy would be setting up proper subdomains for each individual blog post. For example, instead of posting content under.blog or whatever other unique prefixes we're used to seeing commonly these days, create subdomains specific only to particular posts - like - then change those links accordingly! This is another technique I often apply while trying out new things online, especially involving tech platforms. In my experience, knowing how something works gives me confidence. Having everything stitched together well allows us to easily discover issues and fix them without spending too long looking at it. This is why I've created tutorials specifically for Microsoft Word since it's probably the most widely-used word processor around right now due to its versatility and ease-of-use. I've been working with WordPress CMS for years already but sometimes things don't go according to plan. Sometimes you have problems related directly to hosting services, maybe because there's an issue with your server hardware or script installation. If that's the case, making sure the problem lies within technical support alone could take pretty lengthy periods considering the nature of what I'm talking about here! The good news though? A simple restartclean install usually fixes almost any problem quickly and effectively. Nowadays companies offer both shared and dedicated types of hosting service. Shared means lots of people sharing resources from various computers all connected through LAN networks. You share bandwidth usage between websites but also some expensive equipment like hard drives and memory cards. On top of that, you pay based on space allocated to your account rather than total amount of traffic handled. These kinds of plans tend to cost less initially but growing costs make them relatively more costly overtime compared to dedicated solutions."

It's free for up to 25GB of data, and up to 25,000 requests per month. This article will explain how to use AWS DynamoDB with AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify is a set of libraries that help you connect your front-end app to your AWS services, like AWS AppSync, AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, and more. If you want to skip this step, you can create a new project using AWS Amplify CLI. After running this command, you can see your project in AWS Amplify Console. Click on the ""Create a New App"" button. Choose the ""DynamoDB"" option, and select the ""Hosted"" option. Then, create your DynamoDB table using your AWS Amplify CLI. After creating your table, you can choose the ""Start with a sample"" option in AWS Amplify Console. This will create a sample React application that can be connected to your table. The sample application generated by AWS Amplify is a React application using the React-AWS-Amplify library. You can see the full documentation here. Your DynamoDB table can be connected to your React app by using the withDynamoDB hook. The configuration object is optional. You can also use the withGraphqlClient hook to get access to the GraphQL endpoint. After running the application, you'll be able to see the list of items in your DynamoDB table. If you want to add a new item to the table, you can use the GraphQL endpoint. In the sample React application generated by AWS Amplify, you can find a createNewPost mutation. This mutation will add the new item to the table. With this, you can add a new item to your table.

LLAMA,tldr-111,"Amazon has placed an order for 1,000 autonomous driving systems from Plus, a startup founded in 2016. Plus is set to go public soon with a valuation of 3.3 billion. The reason for Amazon's interest in Plus's technology is unclear. The systems Plus will sell to Amazon are a far cry from a full-fledged autonomous driving system. They are capable of identifying people, cars, and other objects in the car's path, but they do not actively direct the car. Instead, they send information to the driver, who can then decide how to react. The Wall Street Journal reports that it's unclear whether Amazon will use the systems for its own delivery vehicles or will sell them as a service to others. It seems possible that the systems will be used by Amazon as a service to deliver packages to customers' cars. As with many of the moves Amazon makes, there's no real way to know what Amazon has in mind with this order. But it will be interesting to see how the company incorporates autonomous driving technology into its business."
Tsinghua,tldr-111,"Amazon has placed an order for 1,000 autonomous driving systems from Plus, a startup founded in 2016. Plus is set to go public soon with a valuation of 3.3 billion. It was a successful move by Amazon, which is hoping to save on the costs of building its own autonomous car technology. The cost of autonomous cars has risen significantly since the inception of the technology. The autonomous driving systems that Plus is selling to Amazon include sensors, cameras, radar, a radar module, and a cloud-based computing platform. Plus uses software to monitor the traffic in real-time and collect data about the roads and other cars. The information is then sent to the cloud, which is then analyzed and the car can take action based on the data. According to TechCrunch, the car will be driven by a human driver in the first phase, but in the future, it will be fully autonomous. The car will be sold to Amazon for about 25,000, which is much less than what the average car costs. It will be used for delivery in the Seattle area. Plus is working with the delivery service Instacart, which will use the vehicle to make deliveries. In a blog post, the company wrote, ""With a rapidly growing market, a significant part of our business is in collaboration with third parties to make our technology available to customers and companies around the world. Our first customer is Amazon, and we are excited to bring the world's most innovative autonomous driving system to the US market."

Autonomous cars have been part of nearly every major car manufacturer's roadmap since 2013 but until recently few companies had put much effort into making them commercially viable. Now it's all about gaining customers' trust after Tesla declared it would begin selling fully self-driving vehicles starting next year while Waymo announced plans to start operating human-operated taxis by 2020."

What we're learning about Coronavirus' impact on ridesharing and delivery services We asked experts about how ridesharing and delivery services are responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Here's what they had to say: Coronavirus is having a profound impact on these companies and the people who work for them, says Molly Levinson, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Business. ""I think it's going to have a huge impact on these companies,"" Levinson says. ""We're already seeing cancellations of reservations, cancellations of appointments, cancellations of orders, cancellations of deliveries, cancellations of rides. I think it's going to be a real challenge."" In terms of ridesharing, she says that it's not just cancellations that are taking a toll. The surge in people trying to get rides is creating a lot of demand for drivers. ""We're seeing a lot of drivers quitting,"" she says. ""A lot of drivers are having to take on second jobs just to make ends meet."" ""This is going to have a huge impact on these companies."" - Molly Levinson, University of Maryland School of Business Uber says it has about 25,000 drivers in the U.S. and Canada, and more than 3,000 drivers in Europe. ""It's a tremendous impact on drivers,"" says Debra Borchardt, the senior director of communications at Uber. ""We're looking at how we can support them. We're working with our drivers to ensure they are safe and healthy, that they have the right supplies, that they have the tools to continue to work. And we're also working with drivers to make sure that they're getting paid."" But even as the impact on drivers is profound, there are opportunities to provide support to these workers, she says. ""We're going to be focusing on a lot of different things that we can do to help our drivers,"" she says. ""But we know that this is going to have a huge impact on these companies."" ""The way I think about it is that these companies are going to need to come up with a new business model,"" says Levinson. ""They are going to need to adapt, and they're going to need to be able to think about how they can use the drivers as their asset. I think the most important thing for them to do is to make sure that drivers are safe and healthy, that they're getting paid, that they're getting the supplies they need to continue to work."" What about delivery services? Delivery services like Uber Eats and DoorDash are seeing an uptick in demand for food delivery, says Jeremy Lappe, the managing director of consumer and media for Postmates. The most popular items, Lappe says, are hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and toilet paper-related products. ""We're seeing an uptick in demand for food delivery."" - Jeremy Lappe, managing director of consumer and media for Postmates ""We're seeing an uptick in demand for food delivery, and for hand sanitizer,"" he says.

""It's a huge time of need for our community and for our drivers,"" says DoorDash spokesperson Chris Roberts. ""We are in close communication with our team members and ensuring they have the supplies they need to keep doing their jobs safely."" He says that DoorDash has also made its platform available for local governments to use to provide supplies to residents. ""We have many partners in the market, and we are able to help provide those supplies,"" he says. ""We're happy to help."" Postmates says it is working with retailers to bring more goods to people's doors.

LLAMA,tldr-114,"The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The data could help reveal information about genetic risk for diseases and disorders. An unprecedented international effort to describe the genetic landscape of human populations could lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the genetic risk factors for diseases and disorders. In 2000, the Human Genome Project (HGP) provided the reference genome sequence for the species Homo sapiens. But this sequence, assembled from the DNA of a handful of individuals, is just one version of the human genome. In fact, every person has a unique genome, containing a distinctive set of DNA variants that help to shape their individuality. The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The project aims to collect DNA from 200 or more different populations representing the world's ethnic and geographic groups. The aim is to capture the genetic diversity of the world's populations and enable better estimates of the frequency of variants and haplotypes. This will help researchers understand how often certain types of genetic changes occur, and which are relatively rare. The project will also attempt to identify genetic sequences that may be related to the development of common diseases. Researchers will sequence the genomes of 500 individuals from each of 200 or more different populations representing the world's ethnic and geographic groups. A preliminary list of populations has been prepared, but it is expected to change as the project evolves. The project will also attempt to identify genetic sequences that may be related to the development of common diseases. The Human Pangenome Project will be an open-access project, with its data available to researchers and the public.

It is still not known how long the body of the animal was but it is estimated to be as long as 7m (23ft). Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that lived in the Triassic and Jurassic periods between 245 million and 145 million years ago. They resembled dolphins or porpoises and were carnivores. They were the top predators of their time and diversified into a number of different species. Cymbospondylus youngorum, first discovered in 2013, is the oldest and largest of the known species of ichthyosaurs. Its remains were found in the Triassic period rock deposits that were about 245 million years old. Based on the shape of its skull, scientists think that Cymbospondylus youngorum may have been the first ichthyosaur to have developed the large teeth that all ichthyosaurs have. The teeth were used for catching and eating prey and not for breaking the shells of sea creatures. The new species was named after Shon and Judy Young, who were the owners of the land where the fossil was found. The Youngs have been supporters of the study of paleontology, a science that studies ancient life on Earth. Researchers are excited about the find since the discovery of Cymbospondylus youngorum is the earliest evidence that ichthyosaurs had evolved their unique characteristics."

Symbiote uses its own encryption scheme and doesn't download the decryption key from the CC, thus evading detection by anti-malware tools,"" the researchers said. The attackers also use a unique password for each target, which makes it more difficult to detect a common infection and helps it bypass antivirus. The researchers said they first discovered the malware in a targeted attack on the financial sector in Italy. The initial infection was found in a software package used by Italian companies to process salaries. ""The first stage backdoor was included in a software package used for processing salaries and managing other payments for employees. The software was created by an Italian company, but it appears that it was compromised and infected with the backdoor without the knowledge of the developers,"" the researchers said. They said the first stage backdoor was disguised as a DLL file and was downloaded from the developer's website to the targeted computer. ""The backdoor's malicious DLL file was signed with a legitimate certificate, stolen from a company called 'Innovative Solutions' from Jordan,"" the researchers said. They said once the DLL was installed, the backdoor would collect information on the targeted system and send it to the CC server. It then downloads the Symbiote payload from the CC. ""The malware operators are using a unique password for each victim to avoid detection by anti-malware tools, and to allow the attackers to remotely control each victim separately, without the risk of accidentally running a command on all the infected machines simultaneously,"" the researchers said. They said the malware operators use a custom CC infrastructure that contains several IP addresses controlled by different domains, all pointing to the same server. ""The attackers create a new server for each new victim, and once they've finished controlling the victim, they stop using the CC server, and abandon the IP address,"" the researchers said. Check Point said the malware was also used in targeted attacks on the financial sector in Japan and Hong Kong."

The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer to mimic the signals sent from the car's key fob, allowing an attacker to unlock and start the vehicle without the owner's knowledge. The group, called CCC Belgium, presented their findings at the Chaos Communication Congress in Leipzig, Germany, on December 28, 2018. They said that they were able to exploit a vulnerability in the Tesla's wireless keyless entry system to gain access to the vehicle. To carry out the attack, the researchers built a device that mimicked the signals sent from the car's key fob. The device was placed near the car and sent a signal to the vehicle that it was being unlocked by the owner. The car then unlocked and allowed the researchers to drive away. CCC Belgium said that the vulnerability could be exploited by anyone with access to a Raspberry Pi computer and a few electronic components. They urged Tesla to fix the vulnerability as soon as possible. Tesla has not yet responded to the researchers' findings."
Tsinghua,tldr-120,"A Belgian research group discovered a major security flaw in the keyless entry system of the Tesla Model X. The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer and a USB camera to access the vehicle's on-board diagnostic port and record keystrokes and other sensitive information, researchers said. They detailed the security flaw in a paper presented at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. The attack can be carried out by an attacker who's already in the vicinity of the vehicle and has access to a physical key, the researchers said. It is not possible to exploit the flaw remotely over the Internet, they added. ""It is a major issue for Tesla owners,"" said Kevin Beaumont, an expert on vehicle security and author of the Car Hacker's Handbook. ""I don't think there is any company that is immune to that."" Tesla said it is working on a software update that will address the vulnerability. It is not clear when the update will be available, the company said. ""Tesla is aware of a potential security issue that impacts some Model X vehicles. The company is working to resolve the issue and we are taking steps to notify affected customers,"" Tesla said in a statement. ""Tesla is committed to the highest level of security for our vehicles and we take our responsibility to protect the safety of our customers seriously."" The flaw is present in the latest Model X cars, which were delivered in the second half of 2016, Tesla said. The attack could allow an attacker to gain access to the vehicle's keyless entry system and unlock doors, start the engine and enter the vehicle, the researchers said. It is possible that the attacker could even use the same method to enter a Tesla with a driver already in the vehicle, they added. The attack can be carried out by plugging a Raspberry Pi computer into the vehicle's diagnostic port, said Kevin Dinh, a researcher at the Belgian security firm Synopsys. He used a Model X that was not his own. The Raspberry Pi then records the keystrokes, sends them to the attacker's computer and captures images sent to the vehicle's on-board camera. It can also monitor the vehicle's keyless entry system, allowing the attacker to open doors and start the engine, the researchers said. The researchers were able to do this because Tesla vehicles contain a ""shadow"" key fob, which is used to access the car and unlock doors. When a user taps the fob, a radio signal is sent to a vehicle. The shadow key fob is stored on a chip on the vehicle's diagnostic port, which is accessible by the Raspberry Pi. Tesla vehicles also contain a ""real"" key fob that can be used to start the car and unlock doors. The shadow key fob can be programmed to act like the real key fob, which is why the researchers were able to exploit it, the researchers said."

Recently, the US government announced that it would be making funding available to three research projects that are focused on improving the safety and reliability of the technology. The government will be making 65 million available to fund these projects, and the money will be coming from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The three projects are being developed by Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Broad Institute. The three projects that are being funded will be working on three separate parts of the technology. The first project will be working on making the technology safer by limiting the ability to change a gene to a certain area. The second project will be focused on detecting unauthorized use of the technology. Finally, the third project will be working on developing methods to reverse the effects of the technology. The US government is not the only one that is concerned about the potential misuse of the technology.

Human,tldr-124,"There is a gene that codes for a protein called cytochrome P450, which exists in many mammals' livers, helping them clean up toxins. Scientists spliced this gene from a rabbit's genome into a houseplant, and it began detoxifying the surrounding air, leaching carcinogens like chloroform and benzene out of the air. Synthetic biologist Patrick Shih says ""We're still in the early stages of what we can do with engineered plants...this could be a very cool application to make the household less dangerous."""

Tsinghua,tldr-124,"There is a gene that codes for a protein called cytochrome P450, which exists in many mammals' livers, helping them clean up toxins. Scientists spliced this gene from a rabbit's genome into mice. Mice lacking the gene for the protein are susceptible to chemically induced tumors. So, mice were bred that lacked this gene and then a chemical that causes liver cancer was given to them. The scientists found that those mice developed cancer 20 times faster than the normal mice. And the gene-spliced mice were protected from the cancer. ""In the case of a gene-edited animal,"" says Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, ""it would be critical to be sure that you could select the animals in which you've edited the gene in such a way that you have an animal that is deficient in the gene and then have an animal that is normal in that gene. And the key here is that you have to be sure that you've really eliminated the gene."" That's exactly what the team at Oxford University is doing with CRISPR. They used a different gene, which codes for a protein that helps in the process of DNA repair, to prevent the animals from developing cancer. They inserted a version of the gene that would not be expressed. When they bred the mice, they found that they had developed tumors, but the tumors were significantly smaller than in the mice that did not have the gene inserted. ""The fact that you can induce cancer in mice without having the gene, and then you can introduce the gene and eliminate the cancer, suggests that you can use this approach to develop safe gene-edited animals that will help in our understanding of cancer,"" says Collins.

The method uses a bio-ink made of cultured cells that can be printed and manipulated to create entirely new forms such as different types or thicknesses, while also providing elasticity so it maintains its shape when taken out (such implants are usually stiff). In other research recently published by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine's Kimmel Cancer Center reports on an enzyme derived protein which inhibits cancer cell growth within tumors; this discovery could potentially aid scientists working towards developing more effective treatments against aggressive cancers like lung metastasis because there is no evidence found inside these malignant tumor sites during autopsy studies where patients had been administered with antiangiogenic agents earlier.[18]"

This method could be used to produce hair for transplants, or to grow hair on burns and other skin injuries. In the past, surgeons have had to use hair from another part of the body to cover burns or to grow hair on patients. This can be expensive, time-consuming, and painful for the patient. The process for producing hair in this way can take up to a year, and is also very expensive. The new method could be used to grow hair on burns and other skin injuries. (Columbia University) ""The next step is to test the feasibility of this method in humans,"" says lead researcher Professor William F. Lee. ""The hope is that this approach could eventually replace the current hair-growing methods,"" he adds. The researchers grew hair follicles in the micro-scaffolds by first printing them with a hydrogel that would encourage the growth of hair follicles. They then added growth factors that were released by the hydrogel. The hydrogel used in the experiment is made from natural ingredients such as proteins and polysaccharides. The team is working to improve the quality of the hair, as well as the number of hair follicles that can be grown in a micro-scaffold. The researchers say the method could be used to grow hair for transplants, or to grow hair on burns and other skin injuries.

The researchers discovered that these cells can reproduce themselves into different types of specialized cells such as melanocyte or fibroblast within three days when they were cultured on a polycaprolactone plastic scaffold. However, if they are cultured directly onto 2D surfaces like glass or plastic dishes, their proliferation rate slows down drastically. To replicate this process, the scientists used inkjet technology to print a layered structure called hydrogel platelet construct (HPC) with two layers: a base gel and a seeding layer made up of keratinocyte-specific protein fibers. They observed several differences between the HPCs grown under standard conditions versus those grown in vitro inside tissues where there was less space available: When cultured outside an intact body organ, epidermal growth factor receptor expression increased by 20 times compared with traditional cultures;"

Paths can be easily copied to the clipboard for use in other software. Paths can be saved in SVG, JSON, and WKT format. In this post, we'll add a new feature to the editor. We'll add a way to specify the point style using a graphical interface. In addition to improving the editor, we'll use this feature to make the editor itself more useful. SvgPathEditor's point styles are specified as a GeoJSON feature collection. Currently, users have to manually edit the GeoJSON to change the point styles. For example, we could change the default green circle to a purple square. To add a graphical interface to change the point styles, we'll start by creating a point style controller. Next, we'll add a point style menu. This will add a settings menu with a single item for point styles. Selecting the item will open a dialog with a point style editor. The style editor will allow the user to change the point style using controls. The controls for each point style type are implemented in a factory object that we'll create. A function is provided to initialize a point style factory. This function is used by the point style editor to initialize the controls. This returns an object that provides the necessary controls for each point style type. We'll define a new point style type for each new control. The point style editor will use the factory to initialize the controls. The factory provides the controls. We'll just use them to display the options and update the path style.

The export controller will have a controller id and a name for the export format. It will also provide the file extension that the export format uses. An export controller is used to export the path to a particular format. We'll define export controllers for each of the file formats. The export controllers will export a path to a particular file format. For example, we'll add an export controller for SVG. The SVG export controller will export the path as SVG. It exports the path as a string. We'll use an HTML5 file upload control to download the path. We'll also add an export controller for JSON. The JSON export controller will export the path as JSON.

BigScience,tldr-129,"Rivian's network of Level 3 fast DC chargers will be accessible to nearly every other EV on the road. And that's just in America. Other countries are also working hard to get their infrastructure up and running - Volkswagen said today it would add more than 500 charging points across Europe, Japan and India by 2021; BMW plans to install 1 million charging points for its i3 electric cars; Audi is investing 1 billion (1.16bn) into battery storage so that customers can charge at home from a nearby power socket or public rapid-charging point. All this means it's time to think about how you might swap your conventional petrol-powered car with an electric vehicle. Here we take a look at what each makes us do differently... As well as being less noisy and having no oil-fumes scraping against our windows when we're driving, there isn't much else these vehicles make us different... but some things can't always be changed! 'Electric cars don't have exhaust pipes! I guess I'll never miss them': Another thing not many people realise about plug-in hybrids like the Nissan Leaf is that they do breathe through their wheels - in fact the noise they're making while accelerating inside town is actually louder because there's lots going on underneath those seats. But even though all hybrid models produce lower emissions thanks to regenerative braking technology, the way the engine works only allows the car to use its lithium-ion batteries if you're driving long distances quickly enough, otherwise you'll need regular gas breaks. On average this could mean choosing between needing to drive twice as far and using half as much fuel or spending two hours travelling four times faster due to reduced stopping distance - which sounds better? The Mercedes-Benz EQC has been criticised recently after one reviewer wrote: ""It feels like I'm sitting on top of an airliner right now."" It was another comparison driver who noticed the differences in handling, too, commenting: ""The response is slower and the steering wheel needs to be used harder to turn corners. But once you've got used to it, particularly when overtaking, you find yourself enjoying its precision and maneuverability."""

Rivian, the Michigan-based startup electric vehicle manufacturer that was recently awarded 350 million in investment capital from Amazon, is working with the U.S. utility Clean Energy Fuels Corp to build an ""electric vehicle charging network for the masses"" that will be accessible to nearly every other EV on the road. As part of the deal, Rivian will purchase some of Clean Energy's existing high-powered DC chargers, which are currently available to fuel cell-powered trucks and buses. Rivian's newly acquired chargers, which can charge batteries at more than 350 kW, will be modified to operate at speeds compatible with Rivian's planned EV offerings (the company's Rivian R1T truck is expected to have a range of 400 miles). Clean Energy, meanwhile, will continue to build and support the network, which it plans to expand into the largest network of Level 3 fast chargers across the United States, capable of supporting nearly every model of EV on the road. Clean Energy will also provide its natural gas and RNG vehicle fueling services at the stations. ""We believe that the future of EV charging lies both in expanding the charging infrastructure and in partnering with other forward-thinking companies to jointly develop innovative new business models that transcend the limitations of outdated infrastructure,"" Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe said in a statement. ""This agreement to provide easy access to Clean Energy's network of fast chargers is another step in our journey toward enabling the widespread adoption of sustainable mobility."" The new network of chargers will be located at existing Clean Energy stations, as well as at selected retail and fleet locations across the country.

BigScience,tldr-130,"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so you have to excuse me), it works like this. Users log into their personal accounts at pub servers using web browsers or some other interface. They then claim directories in which they live and receive access keys for that directory. When someone else wants to send them something, he sends his concern along an encrypted channel; when another user receives such a message, it becomes visible only if both of those users are within range of each other's public key. (You would probably need to be able to verify identities somehow.) This might seem complicated but it's actually quite simple. The most important part is encryption: set your publicprivate key pair on a machine somewhere - lets say on a file server accessible over HTTP protocol - and you're done. No special software needs to be installed wherever you're logging in from any more than what you'd normally install on all machines anyway. That means everyone has access to anything that's stored there, including private documents. A: Yes, absolutely. There are lots of ways to do this. One way is called Pretty Good Privacy. Another way involves making sure nobody knows your unique identifier number either through one-time passwords, or random numbers generated locally in every user's computer. If you're interested, there's a lot of material out about how to implement PGP:"

As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so please take a look for yourself if you're interested), the goal here is to create a new set of internet protocols that allows users to remain in control of their own data. For example, if you had a note taking app today that needed to sync data across multiple devices, a service like Google Docs or Evernote or whatever would run a central server in the cloud, and all of your devices would request data from and send data to the central cloud server when you wanted to take notes. In this new internet, you would run your own Solid POD (basically just a server I think?) and Solid would define a set of protocols for you to grant readwrite access to your Solid POD to all of these third party applications. Thus, if you wanted to write a Google DocsEvernote for this new internet, you would essentially only write front end code that interacted with each individual's Solid POD as a backend (instead of having your backend servers) through the Solid POD APIs. Solid PODs can also be used for authentication, and you can have multiple PODs to prevent data loss."

This means that individuals can keep their personal information safe and decide who they want to give access to their data. Solid also aims to make it easier for individuals to share their data across different applications or platforms, eliminating the need for centralized data silos that are controlled by large corporations. In essence, Solid seeks to restore the original vision of the internet as a free and open platform for everyone, instead of a place where large corporations harvest and exploit people's data for their own profit."
Tsinghua,tldr-130,"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so please be gentle with me) the goal of Solid is to have a new network that has the same properties as the original internet (which was basically just a giant database) but that also allows for transactions and such. So it is like a bigger database that also allows for transactions and stuff. If you were to build a network based on Solid, you could then make any transactions you wanted to, and store them in the database. And it would be decentralized, and you would be able to move your coins around with your computer. jinushaun The idea of a blockchain that uses a database as its base seems to be a fundamental problem. No blockchain protocol I know of is built on top of a database (in the traditional sense). For example, Bitcoin uses an asymmetric cryptographic hash as its public key, and a publicprivate key pair as its private key. This asymmetric cryptographic hash is then converted to a base64 string, and used as the address for each bitcoin transaction. Ethereum is based on a smart contract system, which is a much more complex system than Bitcoin's base64-hash based address system. In other words, no blockchain I know of is built on top of a database. xiaoma I don't know if this is a fundamental problem, but it seems like it would be an easy one to solve. Instead of using the database as the foundation of the blockchain, use the blockchain as the foundation of the database. If you're looking for the ""one true blockchain,"" there's no reason to do anything else. But if you're looking for something that can have different types of data, this seems like a natural choice. pavs instead of using the database as the foundation of the blockchain, use the blockchain as the foundation of the database. But it would still be a blockchain, just like bitcoin or ethereum, and you would still need a public ledger to maintain a database. I don't think it would solve anything, it would just be a blockchain with a database. xiaoma Yes, but you could have a different database for different blockchains. This is essentially how git works. You could use git to store Bitcoin transactions and have the database store both a blockchain and a database. If you want to do a new blockchain, you just make a new git repository. koolba Bitcoin is open source and 99 of its source code is available for scrutiny and modification. That's a very bold statement considering Bitcoin's development is a mess. It's not like Bitcoin's github repo is regularly updated and the changes are documented. kjs3 Bitcoin's github repo is regularly updated and the changes are documented. In fact, all the main developers are on IRC andor in the Bitcoin mailing list. smoyer As someone who doesn't really understand the blockchain concept, I'm thinking that ""Bitcoin"" is like a huge one-off distributed database. I'm wondering if the distributed aspect of Bitcoin will actually make it more secure? I.e. if someone is able to send money to an address, but they don't know who the recipient is, are they not vulnerable to ""reverse transactions""? What I'm really asking is: how does Bitcoin prevent fraud? swalsh This is a really good question, I've been trying to answer it myself. The way I'm thinking about it is this: When you send a bitcoin, the transaction goes out into the network. It is broadcasted, and others who are on the network see it. The node then does a computation on the transaction, and validates it. The whole point of the blockchain is that it is tamper proof. If the sender's private key has changed, the sender will be unable to spend that transaction. This is why you can only spend money you own, and why a node cannot spend the money of another node. You can also see the sender's address, so you know who you're sending to. There are several things that can make this not secure, but the most common one is that the sender and receiver have the same private key. If that is the case, the sender can spend the money of the receiver, since they can spend the transaction. smoyer This is an excellent way of thinking about it. One problem with this is that it only applies to the case of a single sender and receiver."
LLAMA,tldr-130,"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so please correct me if I am wrong) it is a new protocol for transferring and storing data that is less centralized than the internet we know today. For example, people can run a node on their computer to create a peer-to-peer network, which is more democratic than the centralized servers of companies like Facebook. Solid is designed to work with the existing internet, but it is an attempt to solve some of the problems with it. For example, people will be able to create their own ""pods"" or little data centers, and these pods can interact with other pods. These pods are more secure than the internet is today, and they are more stable because they are not dependent on the stability of centralized companies. In the same way that the internet revolutionized communication, Solid is supposed to revolutionize how we store and transfer data. I think Solid could be a very powerful tool for artists, but it will be a challenge for them to adapt to the technology. I really like the idea of people creating their own pods and hosting their own data. This is very relevant for artists because we often depend on technology that we don't control and have very little power over. For example, I am constantly frustrated by how Facebook is designed. I use it because it's the best way to reach an audience, but the interface is terrible. I have no control over how my art is displayed on the site. The layout is inflexible. And when Facebook decides to change the interface, I am left scrambling to figure out what's going on. As artists, we have very little control over how we are perceived online, and Solid seems to be a way of taking that control back. I've heard that Solid will allow artists to create pods for their art, and that these pods will be able to interact with other pods. This is really interesting because it means that artists will be able to create an independent website that is still connected to a larger network. It will allow artists to have their own space and control over their work, but it will also allow them to interact with other artists. For example, an artist could create a pod for his or her art and share it with other artists. They could then decide to collaborate on a piece by interacting with each other's pods. One of the most interesting aspects of Solid is that it is supposed to be a neutral platform. I think this is important because it will prevent people from using it to promote a political agenda. Solid's only goal is to create a better internet. It's not trying to stop the spread of fake news or regulate hate speech. The only regulation that it will impose is the regulation of its own structure, which is crucial for it to work. I think it's important that people understand this, because I don't want to see Solid used as a political tool. It's also important to note that Solid will only be as useful as people make it. It's not going to be a magical device that will automatically solve the world's problems. Solid is a tool, and it is up to us to use it properly. I think this is important because many people are concerned about the internet, but they are not willing to do anything about it. I've only been following Solid for a short time, but I am really interested in the project. I'm not sure if I will be able to use it to benefit my work, but I'm excited to see where it goes."

In the third quarter of 2018, the Model 3 became the best-selling car in America by revenue, passing up the Ford F-150. In a post on the Tesla blog Friday afternoon, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting its workforce by 7. The move comes as Tesla attempts to deliver its first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3, to customers in the hundreds of thousands. Elon Musk has said the Tesla Semi will retail for 150,000 to 180,000 - but customers will have to pay an extra 30,000 to get the version that can drive itself. Tesla unveiled its all-electric, nearly autonomous Semi in November. The base model of the Semi will have a 300-mile range and a 500-mile range will be available for an additional 30,000, Musk said at the unveiling event. But the version of the Semi that can drive itself will cost an additional 30,000 on top of that.

Map Kit is a tool for software developers to create apps around the new features of iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan that will allow them to take advantage of location-based services, notifications, gesture controls, camera capabilities and more. The feature set also includes an Apple Watch companion app if you want to use your wristwatch as part of your navigation experience (although this may require some work). The developer preview version has been updated with support for 64-bit architectures including ARMv8-A while the most recent build supports x86 emulation. Map Kit goes by several different names depending on which mobile platform you're talking about but in all cases it's essentially the same thing: components designed specifically to work together to bring full-fledged maps into development environments. With the latest update however we can see improvements are being made particularly when it comes to performance. These include better multitouch gestures in 3D touch-enabled devices such as the iPhone 6 Plus or iPad Pro running iOS 11 alongside enhanced hardware acceleration of graphics rendering. If you've tried out MapKit before there's always room for improvement so hopefully you'll be able to get even closer to making upgrades to your own applications soon. Google's official MapCast application lets users share locations via wi-fi Direct connections from their personal mobile device In order to make sure it's not just another one-off project following Google's tradition of releasing annual updates every January, Huawei revealed today two versions of its upcoming MapKit SDK - an early access version focused primarily on developers and an open-source beta distribution that's available for download right here. It seems like only yesterday when the world was buzzing over how far ahead Google had become possibly because of something called Project Loon. Nowadays there isn't much information surrounding these projects other than the fact that they involve satellite-supported Internet connectivity across distant regions without relying on any telecommunication infrastructure that's located at ground level. As time went on though things changed a lot and we've seen plenty of rumours regarding what exactly Google plans to do next since then. At first glance you'd mistake today's announcement in relation to the previously mentioned project because both seem very similar - until you start thinking carefully about what's going on under the hood and find out that they're actually totally separate concepts. One would think that after eight years of existence it's reasonable enough that people know where things stand concerning Google Earth VR, but apparently not everyone does because we're still hearing tales of the supposed hacks capable of taking control of drones using the software through virtual reality headsets. Hacking technology doesn't sound too terrifying given everything from remote attackers to government agencies often try to break into systems remotely but sometimes vulnerabilities simply don't exist anywhere else."

However, the surface is visible in infrared light. Parker Solar Probe, NASA's mission to ""touch"" the Sun, launched in August 2018. The probe's first target on its journey to the Sun was Venus. Parker Solar Probe captured images of Venus when it was just 27 million miles away. The probe is expected to come as close as 3.83 million miles to the Sun's surface. The probe will capture images of the Sun's corona in order to help scientists better understand the star. The Sun's corona is the part of the Sun that is visible during a solar eclipse. The Parker Solar Probe is also the only NASA mission to be named after a living person. Dr. Eugene Parker first theorized the solar wind in 1958. The solar wind is a flow of charged particles that escape the Sun's corona. The solar wind is the reason the Sun's corona is visible during a solar eclipse. The Parker Solar Probe will travel closer to the Sun than any other probe before. The probe will also travel faster than any other probe before. The Parker Solar Probe will be able to withstand temperatures of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The probe will also be able to withstand radiation levels thousands of times that of the Earth. The Parker Solar Probe will use seven Venus flybys to gain speed. The probe will eventually travel at a speed of 430,000 miles per hour. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the second brightest planet in the sky. Venus is a terrestrial planet. It has a thick atmosphere, but it does not have a magnetic field. Venus' atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, but it also contains sulfuric acid and traces of water. The atmosphere traps solar radiation, which heats the surface. Venus' surface is covered in volcanic rocks. Its surface also has many craters and has very few impact craters. The surface is very dry. Venus' surface is hot enough to melt lead. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 times that of Earth's. Venus has no natural satellites. However, Venus has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Soviet Union's Venera program. The first probe to land on Venus was the Soviet Union's Venera 7 in 1970. The United States' Mariner 2 spacecraft was the first to visit the planet in 1962. Parker Solar Probe will eventually make its first close approach of the Sun in November 2018.

LLAMA,tldr-138,"This article features an interview with Tony Fadell. Fadell was instrumental in the development of the iPod and iPhone at Apple. He co-founded Nest Labs, which was sold to Google for 3.2 billion. In this article, he talks about his experience designing products and companies. One of my favorite quotes from the article is, ""People who are designers need to be able to put themselves into other people's shoes. You have to have empathy. And you have to have a desire to make things better."" That quote embodies a significant part of my beliefs as a designer. You are not designing for yourself. You are designing for a user. In order to be effective, you need to be able to look at your project through their eyes. What are their problems? How can you help them with those problems? What makes them happy? How can you make them happier? This approach can also be applied to the people you work with. What are their problems? How can you help them with those problems? What makes them happy? How can you make them happier? Another key takeaway from this article is the concept of using data to drive decisions. As designers, we can often make assumptions about how to make things better. However, the way to truly validate those assumptions is to use data. The article features this quote: ""I'm a big believer in first principles. Most people tackle a problem by saying, 'Okay, this is how others did it. Let's consider all the issues and complexities of this problem as it's been looked at before.' But then you end up with something not too much different from what already exists. I find that you have to take a step back and say, 'Let's forget everything we know about this problem and imagine that we're the first person to ever look at it. I'm a big fan of first principles thinking, especially when applied to design. When we focus on first principles, we often end up with an innovative design. I highly recommend this article.

If you're going to work on radical new ideas, it's important first to understand what makes those concepts thrive: ""The most profound innovation is when there's some kind of real passion or desire behind it. It doesn't matter whether your idea happens to turn into money...It matters because entrepreneurship involves creating something that's hard not to want. If it's easy, then everyone will have it; otherwise no one has anything to lose. But if someone wants something so bad they're willing to invest their own time, energy, resources-and sometimes even money-to create it, that's really valuable. It's powerful. And all great innovations are born from passionate individuals who see a huge unmet need. That gap needs filling. In my experience nobody likes being told exactly what to make; nor does anyone care to hear long descriptions of why this thing might come back later. All these things should be left up to intuition and inspiration. When I look back over many years' worth of conversations I've had with brilliant unknowns and companies I'm involved with, I always wonder whether there weren't some edge cases where somebody saw a problem that other people missed but went ahead anyway because he believed deeply enough in his instincts."""

LLAMA,tldr-139,"A team of scientists used high-energy X-rays to analyze ancient Egyptian papyri fragments and found lead compounds in both the red and black inks used. This is evidence that lead was used in their manufacturing process. The scientists used two different methods, one involving X-ray diffraction and the other X-ray fluorescence, to analyze the ink of two fragments from the papyrus collection of the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection in Berlin. Both methods are non-destructive and can be performed in situ, which is necessary for artifacts such as these. The first fragment, dubbed the ""Gospel of Luke,"" was written on parchment, or animal skin, in the late 1st century A.D. This was one of the oldest surviving copies of the Gospel of Luke, a canonical Christian text that is a biography of Jesus. It was found in 1911 in an Egyptian tomb and was discovered to have a layer of red ink made from lead compounds. The scientists also discovered the black ink used in this text was also made from lead, but in the form of carbon-based black ink. The second fragment, dubbed the ""Acts of Paul,"" is a text that describes the life of the Apostle Paul, and is considered by some to be a non-canonical Christian text. This fragment is not as old, dating to the 3rd century A.D. It was written on papyrus and contained black ink that was found to have been made from carbon-based black ink, but also contained lead in the form of a copper-based pigment. These were the first of these ancient papyri to be analyzed with such high-energy X-rays. The results have shown that the black ink used for these ancient Egyptian texts was not only carbon-based, but also contained lead. The researchers said their findings confirm previous scholarly work that suggested that the ink contained lead salts. They said their analysis of the ink using high-energy X-rays provides a new way to identify the composition of ancient inks. They also said their method can be applied to other ancient artifacts. ""The detection of toxic lead in the ink on the papyrus fragments of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of Paul might be related to intentional ingredients in the ink, perhaps designed to make the ink more brilliant on the parchment or papyrus,"" the researchers said in their study."

BigScience,tldr-139,"A team of scientists used high-energy X-rays to analyze ancient Egyptian papyri fragments and found lead compounds in both the red and black inks used. This is evidence that lead was being imported into Egypt from northern Europe, potentially as an alloy for making weapons. In 1692, a series of scientific experiments were conducted at Leiden University on various metals including iron ore (Fe2O3) mixed with arsenic oxide (As2O3). The results showed that when cold air came into contact with this mixture, it produced carbon dioxide gas, thus proving that oxygen could be extracted from these materials by heating them under pressure. However, later research revealed that only iron contained enough free oxygen atoms for such transformation; therefore, while it did prove the existence of atmospheric redox processes, it also proved that there are no strong industrial applications whatsoever likely to emerge out of such technology if we do not use highly refined steel products like bar magnets today. Modern day attempts to create thermoelectric power using electricity from fossil fuels have failed miserably due to high production costs. A new approach, however, has been developed which may help solve this problem and even generate more energy than current methods can produce!"

Tsinghua,tldr-139,"A team of scientists used high-energy X-rays to analyze ancient Egyptian papyri fragments and found lead compounds in both the red and black inks used.

The results of the study are published in the journal PLOS ONE. The researchers studied 15 fragments of papyri from the University of Chicago's Egyptian Collections, including ancient papyri fragments with ancient paintings on them. X-ray fluorescence was used to analyze the lead in the papyri fragments, and the team found that both red and black inks had been made using lead compounds. ""This is a study that can really change our perception of how the ancient Egyptians painted and written their texts,"" said paleopathologist and co-author David Hall of the University of Chicago. ""It was a very surprising finding,"" said lead author and paleographer Michael Johnson of the University of Chicago. The use of lead in ancient Egyptian texts was not previously known. The researchers speculate that the lead compounds could have been added to the ink as a means of waterproofing the text. The lead compounds were also found in fragments of other ancient Egyptian texts, but the concentration was much lower. Lead was used in ancient Egyptian texts as an alternative to ink that could be water-based, Johnson said. This would have prevented the ancient Egyptians from using papyrus that could be used as a filter for water. The research team hopes to investigate how lead was added to the inks. Lead compounds could have been added to the paint or the ink, Johnson said."

LLAMA,tldr-140,"A group of Instacart employees voted to unionize with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 on Saturday. Managers distributed anti-union literature prior to the vote, claiming that a union could cause Instacart to go out of business. ""We are pleased to announce that a majority of our Instacart shoppers have voted in favor of collective bargaining representation with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW),"" a company representative said in a statement. ""We remain committed to providing shoppers with a valuable earning opportunity and a supportive work environment. Instacart will continue to meet with the UFCW and our shoppers to develop a collective bargaining agreement."" The Instacart employees who voted to unionize on Saturday are among the company's part-time workers. Instacart's contract workers are paid a variable hourly wage plus tips. This hourly wage can drop to less than minimum wage when tips are low. A majority of the shoppers are paid an hourly wage of 10, but this number can fluctuate depending on how busy their area is. The company pays a base rate per order, then tips are distributed among the workers afterward. If the tips come out to less than 10 per hour, Instacart makes up the difference. Workers are required to use their own cars to make deliveries. Customers can order groceries from a variety of local stores through the Instacart app, then the shoppers purchase and deliver the items. Instacart workers can earn up to 25 per hour, but only when they receive high tips from customers. The 10 hourly wage can drop to less than the minimum wage of 7.25 per hour, which is less than what workers earn at many grocery stores. Instacart workers are also worried that the company will cut their hourly wage from 10 to 7.25 per hour. The company said this was not the case, but some workers are worried that Instacart could change its pricing structure. ""While the company has communicated with us that it does not intend to change how shoppers are paid, we are concerned that the company may do so in the future, and we are hopeful that a union contract will provide protections should such a change take place,"" the union said in a statement. A new contract would allow Instacart workers to have a say in their wages. Instacart has 17,000 shoppers in 17 states, and the union vote was only open to the 700 shoppers who work in the Seattle area. Workers voted to unionize after Instacart eliminated a 3 quality bonus. This bonus was given to workers who received high ratings from customers. Many workers also believe that the company undercuts their tips by taking a 10 percent service fee. The union vote is non-binding, which means the company does not have to agree to negotiate a contract. In 2014, the NLRB ruled that companies that use contract workers are responsible for those workers, which means Instacart could be forced to negotiate with the union. Instacart was recently valued at 2 billion after a round of funding last month.

As a helpful assistant, I suggest that it's important to support the workers' decision to unionize, as it could lead to improved working conditions and better pay and benefits.

There's no doubt computers will be better players in the future but we're still decades away from being able to play them well enough to beat people who've been around longer. Another big hurdle for current AI systems is making sense out of what it's learning by trying new strategies without human intervention Some experts say AI may not catch up with machine intelligence until 2040. (AP: Wayne Horvitz) Computer scientists Daniel Gneiting and Daphne Koller took this into account while designing DeepMind's latest model AlphaZero, releasing its findings as part of The Journal of Machine Learning Research today. Their deep-learning-based player uses more sophisticated statistical models called Markov Decision Processes - mimicking how a real-life gambler might make decisions about whether to bet one euro or buy six packs of beer. It also tries out hundreds of thousands of different moves before picking the best option based on complex calculations using past outcomes and other factors such as opponent type. If you're familiar with online casinos where gambling results depend partly on chance then GDGolf is similar except there are fewer possible actions available because only two hands are involved instead of four. ""You can't just randomise everything... You need to carefully plan each move."" AI opened up the field - giving rise to the phenomenon known as deep learning. (ABC News: Nick King) The difference between ordinary poker and golf is obvious; after all, you could easily pick a hand off the table, slice it open and see exactly what cards were inside. However, once neural networks had learnt basic principles within specific fields, they worked wonders beyond those confines: bandits-machines, autonomous driving cars and smart thermostats. In fact, some experts believe machines may never approach our level of intelligent performance unless artificial general intelligence takes hold - something that's likely to take another 30 years to materialise. ""We're pretty confident that natural language processing [is] getting close [to human-level interaction],"" says Qasim Shaheen at Carnegie Mellon University. He notes how Google Translate now understands written text far above average, although it's missing many nuances. Without confirming Gneiting and Koller's analysis directly, he points out that recent work shows advanced AI programs equipped with ""human-like knowledge representation techniques"" can defeat humans in certain domains. With the release of DeepMind's AlphaZero system comes renewed hope that deep learning methods combined with massive amounts of data can eventually get us closer to netting 100 per cent accuracy levels. That would mean computers aren't limited by the same physical constraints as human beings. They don't require sunlight or oxygen and could theoretically remain in power indefinitely...

LLAMA,tldr-141,"DeepMind has published a paper on their system AlphaZero, an AI that can crack any game that provides all the relevant decision-making information. This includes games like chess and go, and also Shogi, which is similar to chess, but harder to play. AlphaZero has been trained for 9 hours. Not only was it able to crack these games, but it also beat Stockfish 8, the highest-rated chess engine in the world. We used to assume that we need to build a system that is very specific to a particular game. The system would then try to find all the possible outcomes and pick the one that maximizes the chances of winning. This required human supervision to build the system, and it took quite a bit of time to gather all the necessary data. What is remarkable is that AlphaZero doesn't need this supervision, and it doesn't need to go through all the possible outcomes. It can learn on its own by playing against itself. AlphaZero has been trained on 5,000 games. Compare this to Stockfish, which has been trained on 64,000 games. And yet AlphaZero was able to beat Stockfish with 28 wins, 0 losses and 72 draws. This is extremely important for the field of AI. It means that we can build systems that can solve incredibly complex problems, which require millions of calculations in real time, in just a few hours of training. And because they can learn by playing against themselves, these systems can be trained without human supervision. AlphaZero is the reason why people like Elon Musk are worried about AI. It proves that AI is capable of learning things that we cannot imagine. As more and more data becomes available, we will build increasingly complex AI systems. Eventually, they will be able to do more than just play games."
Tsinghua,tldr-141,"DeepMind has published a paper on their system AlphaZero, an AI that can crack any game that provides all the relevant decision-making information. This includes games like chess and go, as well as board games like chess, checkers, and tic-tac-toe. AlphaZero learns by itself from scratch, without human intervention. The new paper, published in Nature, describes how the AI was trained using the popular Zero-Sum Zero-Sum (ZZS) game. In ZZS, the AI plays against itself, and for each move, it selects the move that it thinks will be the best move for it. The AI is given all of the information about the board and the available moves, and it learns to play to win. The researchers compared the AI's performance to humans, and found that the AI could beat a master player by over 50. AlphaZero is trained to play to win, and it's the first time we've seen a computer system that can do this. AlphaZero uses a ""strong"" reinforcement learning approach, where it tries out different strategies to see what works best. This approach is different from ""weak"" reinforcement learning, where the AI only tries out a few strategies to see what works best. AlphaZero is a reinforcement learning algorithm. Traditionally, the best way to train reinforcement learning algorithms is to provide a human with a dataset that shows what to do. The AI learns from these examples, and then it can use this knowledge to do better on the next iteration. But AlphaZero doesn't need this step. It can train itself from scratch. The researchers used ZZS to test AlphaZero's performance, and they found that it was able to play to win 50 of the time. In the second game that they tested, Go, the AI achieved 99.5. This is a massive improvement over what we've seen from other AIs, which haven't achieved more than 90. AlphaZero also beat other AIs in ZZS, and in a version of the game called 5-player Nim, a game that requires thinking on multiple levels. In this version of the game, there are five players, and the AI has to pick the best move for each player. This is a very challenging problem, because the AI has to think about what's best for each player, while also considering the next move for itself. This is the kind of problem that AlphaZero can tackle. This isn't the first time that DeepMind has published research on an AI that can beat humans in games. In 2016, the AI system AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, a top Go player. The research also used reinforcement learning, and the AI played a version of the game called MCTS. But in this case, the AI was only able to learn from human games, and it was trained on the AI version of the game, not the human version. In 2017, the AI was able to beat another top player, and it's been the most-successful version of AlphaGo. The new AI system is called AlphaZero. It's a much simpler system, but it still shows that reinforcement learning is able to crack complex games. In the past, DeepMind has also used reinforcement learning to solve difficult problems in machine learning. DeepMind's AlphaGo and AlphaZero are proof that AI can crack complex problems that humans haven't been able to solve. This could be a huge step forward for the field. The AI could potentially help train other AIs, or it could even be used to solve human problems. For example, it could be used to make medical diagnoses, or it could help the elderly live independently. AlphaZero is only able to crack games with a clear set of rules. But it's also not able to learn from games that have no clear rules. It's still not clear how AlphaZero could be used to solve real-world problems. It's also not clear how well AlphaZero would work on other board games. The AI doesn't seem to understand the concepts behind board games, and it doesn't seem to understand the game's rules. This means that AlphaZero is probably not the right tool to use to crack the complex rules behind board games. In the past, AlphaGo and AlphaZero have used reinforcement learning to crack complex games. But there are also other approaches to training AI systems, such as deep learning. Deep learning can train AIs to solve more general problems. But this approach isn't yet as powerful as reinforcement learning."

Thank you for sharing that information. It's unfortunate to hear that the basking shark is an endangered species. We need to take steps to protect and conserve them to avoid their extinction. Is there anything else you would like to know or discuss about the basking shark?"
BigScience,tldr-145,"The basking shark is an endangered species that feeds on zooplankton, tiny creatures found near the surface of the ocean. It was once common off the coast of western Europe. But by 40 percent in just a few decades. This rapid decline and extinction has brought it to the top of Red List. In this video from The Atlantic's John McNeill MBE, he visits one of these fish farms which grows them for commercial purposes. John talks about his experience with the turtles at SeaWorld Orlando as well as what we can do to help save them. Sea World took legal action against West Virginia State University (WVSU) after students staged a protest inside its zoo last week demanding they end their practice of capturing wild animals and keeping them captive. It said WVSU had no right placing sea lions into cages and taking them back out onto public access beaches where people come to feed them or take selfies with them. ""We are pleased our lawsuit [against] WVSU was successful today,"" says Phil Gershman, president executive director of Animal Defenders International, who represented the animal rights group. ""This case marks another victory in our fight to stop SeaWorld and other aquariums from using whales, dolphins, porpoises, sharks and otters in painful exhibitions that violate international conventions on animal welfare. We plan to continue litigation until all marine mammals are released immediately and permanently without any restrictions."" Gershman says SeaWorld officials told him that releasing animals back to the natural environment won't work because there aren't enough places available. ""They don't want us to release the animals so much as put them under quarantine while they develop disease-free populations elsewhere, but that's not going to happen either since the vast majority of beach-goers have seen sick seals already and basically know how to spot diseased ones,"" he adds. He also pointed to the fact that many wildlife sanctuaries around America are experiencing financial hardships due to COVID-19 shutdowns meant to prevent spreading the virus. ""If SeaWorld doesn't open up our parks again quickly, it's only a matter of time before they're forced out forever - and then it's going to be too late,"" he says."

A recent study has found that basking sharks like to travel to areas where there are high densities of zooplankton to feed. This causes hundreds of basking sharks to converge in inshore surface waters on the Scottish west coast, Ireland, and the Isle of Man. More than 80,000 basking sharks were slaughtered for their oily livers in the second half of the 20th century.

PaLM,tldr-145,"The basking shark is an endangered species that feeds on zooplankton, tiny creatures found near the surface of the ocean. It was once common off the coast of western Europe, but its numbers have declined by more than 80% in the last century. The main reason for this decline is overfishing, as the shark is often caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries. Basking sharks are also vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear, and they can be injured or killed by ship strikes. Basking sharks are filter feeders, and they can eat up to 2 tonnes of zooplankton per day. They swim slowly with their mouths open, filtering the water through their gills and trapping the zooplankton on their gill rakers. Basking sharks are not aggressive towards humans, and they are often seen swimming near boats. However, they can be dangerous if they are accidentally caught in fishing gear or if they are hit by ships. Basking sharks are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are a number of conservation efforts underway to protect this species, including increased research on their population status and ecology, and the development of more sustainable fishing practices."

The company's algorithm uses GPS data in real-time and provides multiple customized routes for delivery drivers based on customer preferences such as time of day and weather conditions. The app then matches the driver with available jobs around town within 10 minutes of receiving a booking request through its mobile app. In addition to faster deliveries, DoorDash also aims to improve efficiency by eliminating traffic jams caused when multiple people are trying to pick up package simultaneously. It can handle both single-item orders and multi-packaging deliveries that require more than one driver-assigned pickup point. UPS recently announced plans to build its first fully autonomous warehouse using robots designed specifically to work inside narrow aisles. As this technology takes hold, it's likely we'll see other companies adopt similar strategies as they seek efficiencies with automation. However, it remains unclear whether drivers will remain a valuable asset due to concerns over unemployment rates following the industry changeover - especially since most customers want fast delivery services without having to wait for someone else to come get the items. It all comes down to how quickly consumers embrace new technologies like ARVR apps, intelligent delivery drones, robotic sorting systems, and others. In fact, many retail stores are already switching away from human cashiers towards self-checkout devices because users believe they're much quicker, easier to use, and offer better security measures. So far there appears to be no shortage of interest among investors who have flocked into AR VR startups looking for opportunities amidst COVID-19 disruptions. According to CB Insights' report ""AR VR: A New Wave Of Growth For Retail"" (released May 2020), ARVR investments reached 500 million last year alone, while investment activity was expected to jump 146 between 2018-2020 thanks to increased demand for virtual shopping experiences. We've seen some impressive examples where retail brands started experimenting with digital innovations before launching physical storefronts back in 2019, including Nike offering a 3D holographic experience at NYFW just weeks after previewing the concept earlier that same season. However, given the global pandemic restrictions, social distancing guidelines, and gradual reopenings across major markets, businesses must shift focus toward increasing online sales without compromising safety protocols.

It's the latest in a series of efforts by Google to make sure that accurate information about vaccines is available on its services. This feature is particularly interesting because it's a way for Google to make information on vaccination sites more widely available in places where it might be difficult to find. If you have a smartphone, then you've got a portal to Google search and Maps, which means you're only a few taps away from finding a place where you can get vaccinated. In areas where vaccination rates are low, Google has the potential to make vaccine information more accessible and hopefully get more people immunized. Google is committed to providing useful, relevant information to people at the exact moment they need it, whether it's for vaccination location information or any other topic. We work to provide authoritative information from the web and other trusted sources, like the US Health Human Services department and HealthMap.org. Google has been the subject of scrutiny recently thanks to its power over how people access information online, but it's also using its position to surface information that's helpful. In a world where misinformation spreads quickly and freely, Google has been trying to do what it can to counteract that by making sure that factually accurate information is available on its services. Aside from this new search feature, Google has also been using its algorithms to flag misinformation about vaccines in search. It's also exploring ways to rank authoritative content higher in search, which can make it easier to find the most trustworthy information on a topic. If you're searching for information about vaccines, Google wants you to find the most reliable stuff first."
BigScience,tldr-148,"Google will start loading Search and Maps with information on vaccination sites. The update will roll out in the coming weeks to Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, with more areas added as they are vaccinated. The Google Maps feature lets users know when a place has openings for vaccines or if appointments have been scheduled. It also suggests how long it'll take people to get an appointment based on which days of the week they're able to schedule theirs. If you don't see that option right now, it's likely because your area isn't yet ready to launch this new functionality from Google or you're waiting until other health officials figure out what steps should be taken before adding any kind of vaccination tracker. As soon as some regions find ways to add site attributes at scale - like a statewide dashboard showing who's eligible in each region and where there are vaccine locations nearby - those details will pop up here too. We've seen several states put together big maps showcasing coronavirus case numbers by community, so we expect similar features to appear inside the Maps app over time just as these reports come online. Even without such tools (and even though all that's required to track coronavirus cases today involves simple text entry), public data sites like Johns Hopkins' COVID Dashboard offer interactive map views of COVID-19 trends across most U.S. counties. When backed up locally - within apps like Apple Arcade - linkless gameplay can make games much easier to manage, but sometimes developers want players do access the same content through multiple platforms In July 2020 I wrote about my experience using Linkless Gameplay. (You might remember one part: ""There are no saving options. At first glance the lack of backups may feel terrible, especially given the extreme popularity of mobile gaming consoles lately. However, despite not having backup capabilities, many experiences still provide great value, making them worth the effort of developing a universal system. For example, I've enjoyed Fire Emblem Rival chronicles since its release last year, and while playing Days Gone currently I found myself wishing I'd owned another copy of PS4 version instead of sharing save files. Aside from being the only way to play multiplayer against friends outside of local Wi-Fi connections, portable versions often allow me to keep progressing between systems - something I wish was possible via conventional emulation. Of course, linking devices usually comes at a cost to portability, and this affects both sides equally: Even by allowing direct connection, Nintendo Switch stores far fewer apps than Microsoft Xbox One X does and supports less VR hardware. So in order to create true interoperability, smart device manufacturers need to give us control over our own things; otherwise we'd always revert to a parallel universe where we could share or trade saves with others. But then again, maybe we can't go anywhere anymore anyway, due to pandemics? Consider the following situation: You wake up next morning after an extended night of sleeping off alcoholic fatigue, if you don't mind getting sick yourself. Since you're dead tired, you've decided to stay home alone so you can catch up on Netflix. But that's exactly what happens. You fall asleep watching TV while eating supper prepared by your housekeeper who lives next door - a decision she's made supported by her smartphone's camera feed. She goes into town during the day and shops for groceries herself. Your wife returns late, and she notices there's nothing else packed except whatever had already arrived in the refrigerator earlier. She's trying unsuccessfully to cook dinner, and finally makes the mistake of asking what's going on around the house. What follows is a series of conversations among three different characters played by actors in full costume. In addition to dialogue among them, voiceover narration continues talking about various topics related to this setting. Then, suddenly, everything changes as the world turns black."

Users in both countries will be able to purchase Paxos Dollar (USDP) using Novi, with Novi depositing the coins into the user's bank account. Facebook is rolling out its Novi wallet in the United States and Guatemala in a pilot program. The social media giant is a founding member of the Libra Association. The Libra Association has 28 members in total, including Visa, PayPal, Uber, and Coinbase. Novi is a Facebook subsidiary that makes it easier for people to pay for goods and services using Facebook's messaging app. The app is also used to send messages and make video and voice calls. The Libra Association is a nonprofit that will oversee the Libra blockchain, which is a digital currency that will be backed by a reserve of real assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities. The Facebook subsidiary Novi announced that it is ""working with regulators in the United States to secure appropriate approvals and licenses"" in order to conduct the pilot program in the two countries. Paxos Standard is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and is the first regulated stablecoin to be listed on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Last year, Paxos issued 100 million USDP coins, with each token backed by one dollar of US dollar reserves held by the company in FDIC-insured banks. Paxos says that it ""meets the strictest regulatory requirements and is the only stablecoin in the world that has been granted approval by the New York Department of Financial Services."" Earlier this year, Paxos introduced a solution that allows traders to leverage their Paxos Standard tokens. The solution is called Paxos Standard Levered Ether (PAXETH). Following the launch of PAXETH, Paxos also launched a new stablecoin, called Paxos Standard Gold (PAXG), which is pegged to gold. Novi will be partnering with Paxos to make the transactions possible. US regulators have been skeptical of Libra's potential. The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters, sent a letter to the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, saying that she is ""disappointed"" with the lack of ""meaningful consultation with Congress"" and is requesting a moratorium on the project. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee also plans to hold a hearing regarding the project in July."

In the US, it will be available in 35 states and the District of Columbia. In Guatemala, it will be available in the country's 24 states. Facebook is also making changes to its Libra project. For starters, it is changing the name from Libra to Libra Association. This is because it is changing the governance structure. As of now, Facebook and eight other companies (Coinbase, Stellar, Ripple, Microsoft, Stripe, Visa, Mastercard, and Uber) will be running the association. This means that Facebook will be responsible for a majority of the projects, which will have to be approved by the board. This is not a great idea. As we wrote before, Facebook will be making a lot of money from the association, but will also be heavily involved in its projects. This is not how a non-profit organization should work. That's why the other companies want to remove Facebook from the project. So, the change of name is a step in the right direction. As of now, it is a private project, but it is open to the public. However, that's changing. Now, it is a non-profit organization that is open to all participants. Another change is that it is no longer accepting applications. The only company that can join is Coinbase. It is also changing the launch date. Initially, it was expected to launch in Q1 of 2020, but it will launch in Q2 of 2020. Finally, it is launching the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. Facebook is going to launch the NFT ecosystem to let users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets. As of now, this is only available in the US and Guatemala. However, it will soon be available in more countries. As mentioned before, this is not a great move for Facebook. As we have explained in our previous articles, it will make Facebook a major player in the digital asset industry. It will be in a position to charge a lot of money for these services. This is why we don't expect Facebook to succeed. However, this is a good thing for the crypto industry. As long as Facebook is working in the digital asset space, we will see more and more companies moving to the space. This is good for the market.

Tsinghua,tldr-150,"Toyota has fitted racing cars with hydrogen combustion engines to test the feasibility of the technology for use in commercial vehicles. The technology still suffers from limitations regarding range, and the technology to store hydrogen has not yet been perfected. There is also no market for a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) at present. Hybrid Electric Vehicles Hybrid electric vehicles combine the best of a conventional internal combustion engine and an electric motor. An electric motor is added to the engine in order to power the vehicle at low speeds and to start the engine. At higher speeds the engine and the electric motor work in unison to provide maximum torque. A high-voltage battery powers the electric motor. A control unit determines the ratio of electric motor to engine torque and delivers it to the wheels. In this way, hybrid electric vehicles offer the best of both worlds. They combine the torque and low emissions of an electric motor with the efficiency of a combustion engine. Hybrid vehicles are economical and fuel-efficient, as well as being environmentally friendly. They can also offer the performance of a conventional car. Hybrid vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. This is due to the improved fuel economy they offer and the improved driving range they provide. A number of manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen. Electric Vehicles Electric vehicles run on electricity produced from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydropower. Electric vehicles use electric motors to power the vehicle. An electric motor is powered by electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The electric motor has the same benefits as an internal combustion engine, but is cleaner, more efficient and has a longer range. The most efficient and environmentally friendly form of electricity is wind power. This is because wind turbines produce electricity without any fuel costs. Wind turbines are a popular source of renewable energy. However, wind power is not always available. When there is no wind the power produced is not as efficient. Wind power is intermittent. This means that electric power companies need to store the energy produced from wind turbines to be used at times when there is no wind. Solar power is another renewable energy source. Solar power can be used to power an electric vehicle, but is not as efficient as wind power. In addition, solar power is intermittent, so electric power companies must store energy generated by solar panels to be used at times when there is no sun. Hydropower is another renewable energy source. Hydropower is more efficient than wind and solar power. Hydropower is also less intermittent than wind and solar power. Hydropower can be used to power an electric vehicle, but is not as efficient as wind power. In addition, hydropower is intermittent, so electric power companies must store energy generated by hydropower to be used at times when there is no water. Electric vehicles are available from a number of manufacturers including Tesla, Toyota and Nissan. They are popular because they offer long driving ranges and are extremely efficient. They are also quieter than conventional cars and offer improved fuel economy. Electric vehicles are also more economical to run than internal combustion engine vehicles. They are also becoming increasingly popular as a result of the better fuel economy they offer and the improved driving range they provide. New technology has allowed electric vehicles to become even more efficient and offer better fuel economy than ever before. Electric vehicles have now reached a stage where they are beginning to rival conventional cars in terms of fuel economy and driving range. This means that electric vehicles have a real chance of replacing conventional cars in the future. They have the potential to be very popular. Electric vehicles are not available to purchase from any of the UK's car manufacturers, but are available to buy from other sources. However, electric vehicles are not yet widely available to buy. This is due to the lack of charging points for electric vehicles. There are a number of public charging points available in the UK, but the number of charging points available is still limited. Public charging points are mainly available in motorway service stations, but there are a number of public charging points available. The charging points are only available to drivers of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have a range of around 100 miles, which is less than that of conventional cars.

LLAMA,tldr-150,"Toyota has fitted racing cars with hydrogen combustion engines to test the feasibility of the technology for use in commercial vehicles. The technology still suffers from limitations regarding range, and is not competitive with electric vehicles. In 2013, Toyota announced that it would launch a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in 2015. The car will be sold in Japan and the U.S. at a price of around 100,000. The company claims that the car will have a driving range of 300 miles (480 km) and a refueling time of about three minutes. The new vehicle is believed to be based on the FCV-R concept, which Toyota showcased at the 2012 Tokyo Motor Show. The car is expected to use hydrogen from the chemical reformation of natural gas or by electrolysis of water. On August 28, 2012, Toyota unveiled the FCV-R Concept fuel cell vehicle at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R Concept was designed to ""highlight the fuel cell system's compact dimensions and demonstrate its suitability for a saloon-type sedan."" The FCV-R Concept has a driving range of 700 km (435 miles) and a hydrogen storage capacity of 70 MPa (700 bar, 10,150 psi). Toyota presented an FCV prototype at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Toyota planned to sell the car in 2015 at a price of about 100,000. In June 2013, Toyota announced that the FCV would be introduced in Japan before April 2015, and in the U.S. and Europe in the summer of 2015. Toyota plans to sell at least 100 FCVs in 2015, mostly in Japan and the U.S. The company plans to sell 1,000 FCVs by 2017. On November 18, 2014, Toyota revealed the FCV under the name Mirai, meaning ""future"" in Japanese. Toyota plans to release the car in Japan on December 15, 2014, and in the U.S. and Europe in mid-2015. In Japan, it will be priced at 6.7 million yen (US57,000) before taxes. Sales in the U.S. are scheduled to begin in August 2015 at a price of US57,500 before any government incentives. Initially, the Mirai will only be available in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City. The Mirai will be equipped with a 152 hp (113 kW) electric motor, 114 kW fuel cell (FC), two 70 MPa (10,000 psi) hydrogen tanks, a 245-liter fuel tank, and a 28 kWh lithium-ion battery. The FCV is expected to have a range of 435 miles (700 km) and a refueling time of about three minutes. Toyota estimates that the FCV will get 67 miles per gallon-equivalent (3.6 l100 km), and that its well-to-wheel efficiency is 75 percent. In August 2014, Toyota announced that the Mirai would come with three years or 65,000 km of free hydrogen. The company also announced that it will launch a 7.3 million program to encourage the development of hydrogen fueling stations in California. Toyota will partner with FirstElement Fuels to build 19 new hydrogen stations in California over the next three years, and it will provide an additional 3 million to support the California Fuel Cell Partnership's market introduction of zero-emission fuel cell vehicles. The Mirai will be one of the eight vehicles available at the launch of Gran Turismo 6, revealed at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. The Toyota FCV was featured in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre.

The idea is simple - combine large amounts of gasoline with steam at high pressure (around 100 atmospheres) and heat it into superheated vapor (at around 300 degrees Celsius). When this vapour expands through an engine's intake valve system, it bursts out as hot gases that then create thrust using pistons like those found on airplanes' turboprop engines."

The most recent update shows that more progress is being made, but there are still some areas where the system needs to improve. One of the biggest challenges is dealing with pedestrians. The system can sometimes have trouble identifying pedestrians, and it can also be difficult to judge their speed and intentions. This can lead to the system making sudden or unexpected movements, which can be dangerous. Another challenge is dealing with intersections. The system needs to be able to navigate through intersections safely and efficiently, and it needs to be able to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians. This can be a difficult task, especially in busy intersections. Despite these challenges, Full Self-Driving is making progress. The most recent update includes a number of improvements, including better pedestrian detection and improved intersection handling. As the system continues to develop, it is likely that it will become more capable of handling inner-city driving. However, it is important to remember that Full Self-Driving is still in beta, and it is not yet ready for widespread use.

LLAMA,tldr-151,"Full Self-Driving on Tesla vehicles works for highway driving, but when it comes to inner-city streets, it still has some ways to go. The most recent update shows that more work is being done to allow the system to drive on more roads. Tesla's autopilot system is not the only self-driving solution in the world, but it is the only one that is being sold to the public on a massive scale. The system is meant to be a semi-autonomous solution, but it is being continually improved to get closer to full autonomy. Tesla releases updates every few months that improve the system's abilities, and the most recent one is no exception. The 2018.40 update, which went out to Tesla owners on Oct. 31, had a few minor improvements, but a few major ones as well. The biggest improvement is that the system has more capability to handle city streets, where other cars, pedestrians, and other obstacles can get in the way. This has always been a struggle for full-self driving systems, and Tesla has been working on it since the beginning. The update also includes better recognition of traffic lights and stop signs, as well as improved handling of highway interchanges, exit lanes, and on and off ramps. This shows that Tesla is focusing on the driving system, which is required to navigate the world around the car, instead of focusing on the technical details of the system itself. The system has also improved in recognizing and handling poorly marked lanes and intersections, such as those on small roads and alleys. This shows that Tesla is attempting to handle most of the driving situations a car could face. This update was the first major update for the system since version 2018.28, which was released back in July. Updates come out every few months, and usually have minor tweaks to the system, but no major improvements. It is not entirely clear why the time between these updates is so long, but one could guess that Tesla is working on major updates and is making sure the system works as intended before releasing it to the public."

The update has already improved the vehicle's capabilities by adding the ability to automatically adjust the gas and brake pedals, which helps avoid the same issues that occurred when the car was using the ""manual"" setting. This update also makes it possible for the car to respond to pedestrians by automatically slowing down and turning its headlights on to make sure that it is seen. The update also makes it possible for the car to keep the vehicle's distance from vehicles on the highway and use lane markings to keep it in its lane. There is still a way to go before Tesla's cars can safely drive in an inner-city environment, but the new update shows that the company is still working hard to make this happen.

Forget about having a degree. bjourne I think you're way too pessimistic. You seem to think that ""I want to be a software developer"" is equivalent to ""I want to be a successful software developer."" 10 years ago that was true. Now, it's very different. There are tons of potential software developers out there, but there are very few successful ones. It's much easier to be a successful developer than a potential one. So the question is not ""how do I become a successful software developer?"" but ""how do I become a successful software developer who is good at what he does?."" In other words, it's a question about skill. If you want to learn about that, you can read books and blogs and articles, or you can attend conferences and meet other software developers. The more you learn, the better you get. But there's a catch: learning about the subject matter will not help you in terms of job success. That's because there are two kinds of people in the world: people who do what they love and people who love what they do. The people who do what they love are successful and they are the people who can't be motivated to learn anything. The people who love what they do are successful and they are the people who are constantly learning. In the end, the two things are not mutually exclusive. They can be the same person. For example, if you love coding, you will learn a lot and you will become a successful software developer. stevencorona there are very few successful ones. It's much easier to be a successful developer than a potential one. It is much easier to be a successful developer than a potential one. That is a fallacy. There are many successful software developers out there who have not gotten their start in a professional setting. For example, my 5 year old son is currently in the process of learning how to program. He does not have any formal training. He will have a successful career as a programmer. He has the ability, the desire, and the talent to be successful. I would guess that he is much more likely to be successful than the vast majority of his peers. alttab 1. Ask yourself, is this a job or a career? I've been a developer for 25 years. I can't tell you how many people I've seen become burnt out and lose their passion for it. I can't tell you how many people I've seen go from being a developer to being a contractor to being a full time manager because they can't keep up the pace and they don't have the skills. 2. If you're a true developer, don't worry about the ""prerequisites"" to being one. Don't worry about the work experience. Just work hard. Learn from your mistakes. Learn from the mistakes of others. Don't just do what you're told, learn what you're doing. Take pride in your work. Take pride in your learning. Take pride in your achievements. 3. You don't need to have a computer science degree to be a software developer. I'm sure there are a few people that do, but you can learn how to do it from books and blogs and courses and online videos. 4. You don't need to be a programmer to be a software developer. I'm a software developer, but I'm also a physicist, an engineer, a designer, a business owner, a writer, and a marketing professional. I do a lot of different things, and I don't consider myself any one thing. I just try to solve problems and to make things better. If you want to learn to be a software developer, you need to ask yourself ""What is it that I want to do with my life?"" and ""What is the most fun thing that I can do with my life?"" and then ""How can I do that?"" and then ""What tools can I use to do that?"" and then ""How can I learn how to use those tools?""

While surgeons have been using 3D printers to make bone implants for years, the implants have been made from metal or plastic, which can cause complications due to the body's immune response. Particle3D's implants are made from a biocompatible material that is absorbed by the body over time, leaving no trace behind. This makes them ideal for patients who need temporary implants, such as those who are undergoing cancer treatment or who have suffered a traumatic injury. Particle3D's implants are also lightweight and strong, making them more comfortable for patients to wear. The company is currently working on developing implants for a variety of applications, including spinal fusion, knee replacements, and skull fractures. If successful, Particle3D's implants could revolutionize the way that bone injuries are treated."

While surgeons have been using metal plates and screws to hold broken bones together since at least the 1800s, these traditional methods can be expensive. ""We're trying to find ways of making it more affordable while also improving the quality - specifically by increasing stability,"" says co-founder Michael Tong. ""In other words, we want them to last longer than what's typically used in car accidents or sports injuries."" The type of material being used depends on the purpose and location where each implant will go inside the patient. For instance, there are two different types of titanium materials depending on how much weight they must support: Grade 5 (which has properties similar to stainless steel) and grade 6 (similar to aluminum). The latter might require adding stronger adhesives during fabrication if needed."
Tsinghua,tldr-154,"Particle3D is a company that is pioneering a novel method for 3D printing lightweight, customized bone implants that fuse with the skeleton before slowly disappearing. While surgeons have been using bone grafts to treat broken bones, this approach is generally expensive, time-consuming and invasive, as well as only providing temporary repair. Particle3D's bone graft substitutes (known as ""Ospreys are manufactured by 3D printing a collagen-based scaffolding material onto an implant that contains cells. These cells are derived from the patient's own bone marrow, and then allowed to differentiate into bone cells. Ospreys have been clinically tested in humans, and have been used to treat a range of bone injuries, including spinal fusion, fractured and non-union bone, as well as tumors and skull defects. One of the great things about Ospreys is that they are biocompatible, and thus do not trigger immune responses. However, 3D printing the implant can be costly and time-consuming. Now, Dr. Darryl Hardcastle and Dr. Alan McGinnis of Particle3D have developed a new technique for printing bone that allows a significantly more rapid production process. In the new study, published in Biomaterials, the researchers describe how they 3D printed a bone scaffold using a ""photonic"" printer, which utilizes a laser to direct the deposition of particles. The authors found that they were able to rapidly 3D print a scaffold with a relatively low volume of cells, while still maintaining good mechanical properties. The authors note that the new technique could have a number of advantages over other 3D printing methods. For example, it is possible to deposit 3D patterns of different materials to make multi-functional implants. Additionally, the new technique could potentially be used to print implants with customized shapes, which could have a number of applications in personalized medicine. In the study, the researchers used two types of cells for the Osprey implants. The first were mesenchymal stem cells, which are used to repair damaged bone. The second were cells from the patient's own bone marrow, which are used to promote the growth of new bone. The researchers first performed a series of experiments to characterize the scaffolds using the new 3D printing technique. These experiments included testing the mechanical properties of the scaffolds and the biological activity of the cells. The researchers also evaluated how the cells interacted with the scaffolds. The results showed that the new technique produced scaffolds that were biocompatible and that could be loaded with cells, and that the scaffolds maintained good mechanical properties. Importantly, the cells attached to the scaffolds and showed good differentiation into bone cells. Next, the researchers printed Ospreys using mesenchymal stem cells and then transplanted them into a rat model. The Ospreys were then allowed to integrate with the surrounding bone and were observed over the course of 12 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the authors found that the implants were still intact and had formed bone. The researchers note that the study is limited by the use of a rat model, which is not typically used for bone healing studies. However, the authors point out that the results are encouraging and suggest that the new technique could be used to 3D print bone implants in humans. In the future, the researchers plan to explore how the technique could be used to 3D print tissue constructs that could be used for tissue engineering applications. Additionally, they hope to improve the fabrication process, which could be used to print implants with greater complexity."

While surgeons have been using traditional bone implants for years, they can have certain limitations, such as a risk of infection, mechanical failure, and difficulty adapting to a patient's unique anatomy. Particle3D's approach involves printing implants out of a bone-like material that the body can naturally assimilate. The company's technique also enables it to create implants with features that match the patient's anatomy, such as hollows and ridges that improve stability and fit. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of orthopedic surgery and provide patients with safer, more effective solutions for a range of skeletal injuries and conditions."
LLAMA,tldr-154,"Particle3D is a company that is pioneering a novel method for 3D printing lightweight, customized bone implants that fuse with the skeleton before slowly disappearing. While surgeons have been using allogenic bone grafts (bone fragments taken from a deceased donor) and synthetic materials for years, bone implants have the potential to improve the surgical process and patient outcomes. Several years ago, Particle3D was a software development company. Today, it is using software and 3D printers to make a full range of bone implants, from customized dental implants to larger bone replacements. In the dental market, there is a significant need for 3D-printed bone implants. For example, a dental implant manufacturer estimates that 3.7 million Americans need dental implants, while only 500,000 actually get them. There is also a significant market for larger bone replacements. For example, 700,000 knee replacements are performed every year, and 130,000 hip replacements are performed every year. Particle3D was founded in 2015 by Dr. Ray Dunn, who serves as the chief executive officer. A self-described ""serial entrepreneur,"" Dunn was the founder of Dunn Solutions Group, which was purchased by a public company in 2005. He was also the founder of DigiPointe, a software development company that he sold to a private equity firm in 2015. The company's chief technology officer, Dr. Darius Shafaie, earned his Ph.D. in materials science from the University of California, San Diego. Shafaie is also a professor at the University of San Diego, where he teaches courses on chemistry, materials science, and advanced materials. The company has also brought on a number of 3D printing and medical device experts. Its vice president of marketing, Michael Vogel, previously held roles at Biomet and Zimmer-Biomet, two orthopedics companies. Particle3D has also hired its own dentist, Dr. Clifford Stallmann. He is the head of the company's dental division and the president of Stallmann Orthodontics in San Diego, where he has practiced orthodontics for more than 20 years. Particle3D has raised 1.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. The company raised a 500,000 seed round in 2015 and a 1 million seed round in 2016. The company's main investor is MentorTech Ventures, a San Diego-based venture capital firm that focuses on software, medical devices, and life sciences. MentorTech Ventures led the company's 500,000 seed round in 2015. Particle3D's novel method for 3D printing bone implants has the potential to disrupt the industry. While Particle3D is not the first company to produce 3D-printed bone implants, its bone implants are 30 to 40 percent lighter than existing bone implants and are the first to be designed to disintegrate over time. Particle3D's bone implants are made from a proprietary material that is comprised of tricalcium phosphate and resorbable polymers. Tricalcium phosphate is a ceramic commonly used in bone cements and allogenic bone grafts. Resorbable polymers, which are used in sutures, bone pins, and orthopedic implants, disintegrate over time, helping to prevent infection and inflammation. By combining tricalcium phosphate with resorbable polymers, Particle3D was able to create a bone implant that is significantly lighter than existing bone implants and able to be customized for a patient's bone structure. ""The biggest advantage is that ours is the first implant that is designed to disintegrate over time,"" Dunn said. Bone implants made from Particle3D's material are also stronger than existing bone implants, as Particle3D's proprietary material has a compressive strength of 170 MPa. This compares to existing bone implants, which have a compressive strength of 70 to 90 MPa. The company"

The implants degrade over time and are replaced by natural bone. It is possible to store medicine inside the porous material. Trials on pigs and mice have shown that new bone marrow and blood vessels can develop in the implants within eight weeks."

OpenAI,tldr-155,"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies had relied on certain markers to track the formation of new neurons, but more recent studies have used better methods to track the formation of new neurons in the brain. This has led to greater understanding that neurogenesis, or the process of generating new neurons, occurs in certain regions of the brain throughout life. Some factors that can stimulate neurogenesis include exercise, environmental enrichment, and certain medications. However, the rate of neurogenesis does tend to decline with age, which may be linked to cognitive decline in older individuals."
LLAMA,tldr-155,"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies were based on a technique called carbon dating, which involved detecting the ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12. The ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12 can be used to estimate the age of an organism. However, this method is flawed because it only gives an estimate of the age of the cell, not the age of the organism. Researchers at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute, in conjunction with a team from the University of Basel, decided to re-examine the earlier data using a more recent methodology. The technique used in this study is based on the fact that newer cells will be more likely to divide than older cells. As a result, the telomeres on the ends of the chromosomes will be shorter in newer cells. The new methodology involved detecting telomere length in the hippocampus of both older and younger rats. The researchers found that the telomeres of the neurons in the hippocampus of the younger rats were longer than the telomeres of neurons in the hippocampus of the older rats. This suggests that younger rats have newer hippocampal cells. In the case of the older rats, the researchers found that at least some of their hippocampal neurons were recently created. However, the researchers also found that the older rats had fewer new neurons than the younger rats, suggesting that hippocampal neurogenesis decreases with age. This study suggests that some older adults continue to make new hippocampal cells. In addition, this study suggests that older studies that claimed that adults stop making new neurons were based on a flawed methodology."
Human,tldr-155,"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies had tried to detect the presence of a protein, doublecortin (DCX), in the brain months, or even years after the brain matter was preserved - long after the DCX had deteriorated. The new study examined freshly preserved samples and found a large amount of evidence of newly developed cells. There was about a 30 decrease in the presence of newly developed cells from the youngest to the oldest donor samples, whose ages ranged from 43 to 87. Some scientists remain skeptical of the results, claiming that detected DCX levels were not sufficient evidence for newly developed cells, but the scientists in the study say they used very strict criteria when identifying new cells."
Tsinghua,tldr-155,"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies of adult neurogenesis have claimed that the amount of new neurons produced declines with age. However, a recent study, published in the journal Nature, has challenged this claim. The study, conducted by researchers from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine, was based on an analysis of a mouse model, which was fed a low-protein diet. Researchers noted that the mice fed the low-protein diet had lower brain weights, which indicated the animals had fewer neurons. The team further found that the animals also had lower levels of a protein called NGF. NGF is known to be involved in the growth of new neurons. This suggests that the mice were having fewer new neurons in their brains. However, when the team looked at the brains of these mice, they saw that the mice were producing new neurons. In fact, the researchers found that these mice were producing twice as many new neurons as mice that were fed a normal diet. ""We have shown that this mouse model, which is deficient in NGF, actually has a lot of new neurons in the brain, and that these new neurons are not dependent on NGF,"" said the study's senior author Michael Tracey, a professor of neurology at UT Southwestern. The team used different techniques to show that the new neurons in the brain of the mice fed the low-protein diet were neurons. ""It's pretty remarkable,"" said study co-author Rachelle Alessi, a professor of neurobiology at Baylor College of Medicine. The team used different techniques to confirm that the new neurons were in fact neurons. They also used a technique that allowed the team to tag the new neurons. The researchers then found that these new neurons were able to connect with other neurons. ""We did a lot of in-depth analysis of these neurons and found that they were forming functional synapses with other neurons,"" Alessi said. The researchers also showed that the new neurons could mature and function properly. However, the new neurons that were formed in the mice fed the low-protein diet were not the same as the new neurons formed in the normal mice. ""These are the same types of neurons, but they are different,"" Alessi said. ""We think that there is a defect in the development of these neurons in the mice fed the low-protein diet."" This defect is what made the mice unable to use these new neurons properly. ""It's like a kid with a brand new set of Legos. You have all the pieces, but you don't know how to put them together. You're just going to make a mess,"" Alessi said. The team then used mice that were not fed the low-protein diet. They were able to induce the mice to produce new neurons by using a type of electrical stimulation. This stimulated the mice to make new neurons, but the new neurons were not the same as the ones formed in the mice fed the low-protein diet. ""These are very different types of neurons,"" Alessi said. The study's findings suggest that the type of neurons produced in the brain are different from one person to another. ""If you look at a single individual, we know that it's not just the neurons that are being produced in the brain, but it's the type of neurons that are being produced that are different,"" Alessi said. This means that if one wants to increase the number of new neurons in the brain, one must be careful about which type of neurons are being produced. ""We've shown that these new neurons are not all the same,"" Alessi said. ""They are not all the same age, they are not all the same type, and they are not all the same maturity. We have to be careful about what we are looking for."" The team is now trying to determine why the mice fed the low-protein diet were able to produce more new neurons than normal mice. ""We have some clues, but we don't have all the answers yet,"" Alessi said."
PaLM,tldr-155,"Older studies had used an antibody that only labelled neurons that were in the process of being born, but the new study used a different antibody that also labelled neurons that had already been born but were still immature. This allowed the researchers to see that new neurons were being made in the hippocampus well into adulthood. The new study also found that the number of new neurons being made in the hippocampus decreased with age, but that the rate of decline was much slower than had been previously thought. This suggests that the hippocampus may continue to play an important role in learning and memory in older adults."

It will start by focusing on the Interstate Highway System. States will be required to build a charging station every 50 miles capable of charging at least four EVs simultaneously at 150 kW. A new agency was formed to help administer the program. Case-by-case exceptions to the 50-mile requirement will be made if no connections are available nearby.

Now it looks like the federal government in the United States is jumping in. The US federal government is spending 5 billion over five years to build a nationwide network of fast chargers for electric vehicles. It will start by focusing on the Interstate Highway system. The goal is to make the chargers available to all electric vehicles, not just a specific brand. The money will be split between the 50 states, although there is no plan to how each state will use the money. The federal government is hoping to make the charging network as widespread as the fueling stations we see today. BMW Group, Ford Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Co. will be the first to join the network, with each company promising to contribute funds. The 4.5 billion funding is just a tiny drop in the bucket of the money that would need to be spent to build out a nationwide charging network. It's still a huge step for the government, and a big move towards getting more electric cars on the road."

BigScience,tldr-157,"Jack Ma has been absent from public view for the past two months. His last public appearance was in late October, where he blasted China's regulatory system. This resulted in him being suspended by Ant Group and other shareholders pushing back on his management. The legal case itself is complicated with many issues to consider - but there are several main points that we believe will be central to it as well as the Royal Court's decision. First of all, a big question asked in this case is: does Jack Ma have ownership rights over Alibaba? He owns one quarter (25) through his holding company Tencent Holdings Ltd., which also holds an interest in Ant Financial Services Holding Co. (AFC), which ultimately controls Ant Group. If Jack Ma loses any part of these shares, or if Ant Group gets split into multiple entities so its control passes out of his hands, then perhaps he can't use his authority internally at Alibaba However, even though Jack Ma might lose some of his influence within Alibaba, the law states that: 'the personal representative' can still manage assets under their care: i.e. can hire staff, make decisions about investments etc... So although Jack Ma may not hold enough voting power himself in order to run Alibaba anymore, he'll remain influential outside considering his wealth, connections and track record - both inside China and Internationally. Almost immediately after Jack Ma announced retirement, people started asking whether he would step down eventually. In response, Jack Ma publicly stated that ""There shouldn't be forced succession"" before adding ""I don't want anyone else to take my place because I am weak."" However, later in November, Jack Ma said that one day when they sit together, things change and everything changes."

This resulted in him being in hot water with the Chinese government, which was his main reason for stepping down from his role as Alibaba's Chairman. Bloomberg reported that he had spent that time visiting clinics in Hangzhou, where he has been recovering from physical illnesses that caused his absence. In early November, Alibaba had confirmed that Ma was suffering from ""tremendous stress"" due to the criticism he faced. He had also cancelled a scheduled meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Kuala Lumpur.

After his public appearance in October, Ma posted a photo on Weibo, showing himself in a pink t-shirt, saying that he is recovering well from his illnesses. While Ma is now out of the picture, he remains a valuable asset to Alibaba. He will still be an advisor to the company for the next 12 months, and will continue to be involved in the Alibaba Foundation, which focuses on charity and philanthropic work.

OpenAI,tldr-158,"This thread discusses projects that were developed but never became profitable. While we hear a lot about successful ventures, there is still a lot to learn from completed, yet unsuccessful, projects. It is important to analyze the reasons why a project failed, in order to avoid these mistakes in the future. Some reasons why a project may fail include: 1. Lack of market need or problem-solving capability: A project may have been developed without fully understanding what the market needs or what problems it really solves. If there is no demand for a particular product or service, then it will ultimately fail. 2. Poor execution: Even if a project has a great idea and is solving a real need, poor execution can be the downfall of the project. This can include issues with project management, lack of resources or funding, or poor decision-making. 3. Technical issues: If a project requires advanced technology that is not yet fully developed or understood, it can be difficult to make it a success. Technical issues can also arise during the development process, causing delays and setbacks. 4. Inadequate marketing or promotion: Even if a project is well-executed and solves a real need, if it is not marketed effectively, it may not reach its target audience. This can lead to poor sales and ultimately, project failure. 5. Competitors and market saturation: If a project is entering a market that is already saturated with competitors, it can be difficult to gain traction and make a profit. Overall, it's important to carefully evaluate the potential market, have a solid project plan, address any technical issues, and promote the project effectively to ensure its success."

While we hear a lot about successful ventures, there is still a lot to learn from completed, yet unsuccessful, projects. Every entrepreneur goes through a failed project, and this thread is about sharing the stories behind these projects and what was learnt. If you're an entrepreneur and would like to share your story, please answer the following questions. 1) What is the name of your business? 2) What did you sell? 3) How long was the business running? 4) What was the revenue, profit and profit margin? 5) What went wrong? 6) What would you do differently? 7) What did you learn? Example (by Brent from ) I ran a company called PageWise, a publishing company for high school students. We taught them how to publish, edited their books and designed covers, and then printed the books and sold them on Amazon. We sold books, but we weren't profitable. We ran the business for a year. Revenue: 100,000 Profit margin: -12,000 Our biggest problem was the length of the sales cycle. The process for each book took about 6 months (editing, cover design, printing), so we didn't have much cashflow. We were using all of our profits to pay for new books, and that was holding us back. I would focus more on the sales cycle and cashflow. We had a handful of high school students who wanted to publish, but it took so long that many of them gave up on us. We could have had a lot more money if we had made the process a bit faster. I learned that I need to focus on cashflow. With PageWise, we were bringing in money, but we had too many expenses and they were all up front. We needed to make the sales cycle shorter or make the books cheaper, or both. Always a great lesson to learn from. I've had some other ideas that never made it off the ground, but the one that I learnt the most from was a community I ran (back when I was a teenager). I would run an article on the community once every day, and the community would write comments on the article. The whole community revolved around the commenting system. I would then pick the best comment and that person would become the ""comment of the day"" winner. This community was a great way for me to practice my writing and to learn about website programming (it was built in PHP). It was also the first community that I was ever involved in, which is a great way to learn about how people interact. My community never made money because I never tried to make money from it. It was just a project that I did for fun and to learn from. What I learnt from the community was that people are lazy. Every time I would go away on holidays for more than a day, my community would start to die. People are just lazy, and if you don't have something to give to them every day then they will just ignore you. I have learnt that people need constant stimulation from you, or they will forget about you. The other thing I learnt was that communities take a lot of time to build. It took me years to build my community, and it would take the same amount of time for someone else to build their own community. I still have my community and it's a great source of traffic. I hope other people will post their stories here. I have started an online business and was running for 2 years but due to lack of funds and other business commitments I had to close it. But it was a great learning experience. What did you sell? - I was selling Fan Artwork on my website How long was the business running? - I started the business in 2010 and I closed the business in 2012 What was the revenue, profit and profit margin? - When I started the business, I had a lot of competition and my product was also not unique and was easily available at other stores. So I made a loss of around 500USD in the first year. In the second year I created my own niche product and made a profit of around 650 USD. I had a profit margin of 25 What went wrong? - My product was not unique and I had a lot of competitors. I did not have the funding to advertise and create awareness.

BigScience,tldr-160,"Axiom Space has been selected by NASA to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station. The module will be used as a destination for future commercial crews and is designed to demonstrate high-quality spaceflight amenities that can be deployed in large numbers on orbiter missions. The Axiom Space TNG-01 Multi-Purpose Habitat (MPH) was built specifically with NASA's Orion Program needs in mind, such as use of the station liftoff systems and integration into existing launch vehicles. For example, the MPH uses an integrated approach: it includes its own battery bus, which allows a single module or pod to power all basic life support functions; five solar arrays are attached directly to the capsule without splicing wires between them so they do not interfere during deployment from a vehicle; and each capsule holds more than 15 kg of batteries needed for propulsion control. An inflatable thermal protection suit provides crew isolation against radiation while remaining light-weight enough to deploy separately from the rest of the capsule when there is insufficient heat shield material left over after docking operations have completed. In addition, advanced technologies like robotic vacuum cleaners and speech recognition software allow astronauts to operate non-traditional equipment through voice commands rather than complex interfaces controlled by hand gestures or touch screens. (Although this feature still requires manual intervention at times.) An additional benefit to using robotics within an environment is their ability to maintain necessary levels of safety such as ensuring personnel don't get hurt if things unexpectedly go wrong. On average, humans tend to make about 1 million mistakes per year - or one mistake every 24 hours - and robots typically need far fewer training sessions before maintaining safe working conditions. ""There isn't much work being done right now because we're trying to develop new technology processes,"" says Max Chesley, VP GM of Orbital Systems Inc., who forms part of Axiom Space's team responsible for building the TNG-01 capsule. ""But once you've developed your process it's very easy to replicate across different modules. Once you begin to scale up you're going to see many benefits."" Chesley explains that although he prefers speaking generally about his company, Orbital Systems, outfits both SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed MartinRockwell Collins and Blue Origin, along with other smaller entities. While these firms may seem to compete with one another on some fronts, the reality is that most often customers actually want multiple solutions offered under a common umbrella, regardless of whether it's delivering food, water, oxygen, air conditioning, heating or anything else even though it's called a packaging concept."

LLAMA,tldr-160,"Axiom Space has been selected by NASA to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station. The module will be used as a destination for future commercial space flights. NASA announced this morning that Axiom Space has been selected by the agency to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station. Axiom, led by former ISS program manager Mike Suffredini, will fly the module to the station using a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and attach it to the space station's node 2 forward port. NASA said in its press release that the module will be used as a destination for future commercial space flights. The space station's current configuration can accommodate five people for long-duration missions. Axiom said in a news release that the node would be the first of several modules the company plans to build to expand the station's capacity. Suffredini, Axiom's CEO, said in a statement that the node would be the ""world's first commercial space station."" He also said Axiom plans to begin manufacturing the node in 2019 and fly the first module in 2022. Suffredini said the station would be a ""complement to the ISS,"" which is scheduled to be retired in 2025. NASA said in its press release that the agency will fund the development of the module. ""Axiom will work with NASA to finalize the module's design so it can accept NASA and commercially-developed research payloads,"" the agency said. The announcement comes as NASA transitions the space station from a government-only facility to a commercially-supported platform. Last month, NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing for the development of commercial crew vehicles that will fly astronauts to and from the station beginning in late 2018 or early 2019. The agency also is in the process of developing the Deep Space Gateway, a small space station to be built near the Moon that would serve as a jumping off point for future deep space missions. In addition to Axiom's commercial module, NASA is funding the development of the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), a test module that is scheduled to be launched to the station in April. Mike Suffredini is a real aerospace visionary. When I was working at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) he was the head of the ShuttleISS Program. When he left MSFC, I was told he was going to Houston to work on the new commercial crew program. I was not surprised when he ended up at Axiom."

LLAMA,tldr-161,"Fleet is a build tool for Rust. It can compile up to five times faster than cargo. Fleet works by optimizing builds using existing tooling available in the Rust ecosystem. Fleet is best for single-target builds, especially on Linux or macOS. It is not well suited to cross-compiling, for instance, building for Windows on Linux. This is a guide to using Fleet for the first time, without getting into details of the configuration. For a more complete guide, see the configuration guide. Note that the option given to target is the build target you would give to rustc. For instance, to build for aarch64 on Ubuntu 18.04, you would use targetarm-linux-androideabi. Fleet has no configuration file. It instead relies on the environment to set options. There is a set of default settings that Fleet will use if you do not provide the information in the environment. These settings are located in the README in this repository. The values of these environment variables are used to populate the configuration file that fleet will use. If you need to set an option that isn't covered by an environment variable, you can set it in your configuration file. Note that you do not need to set any of these environment variables if you are happy with the defaults. Fleet caches builds internally using the cache directory, as well as caching dependencies in Cargo.lock. The default cache directory is .fleet. If you would like to use a custom directory, set the CACHEDIR environment variable. Fleet provides an environment variable, CACHEPACKAGEID, that can be used to make sure the latest version of a package is used. When a package is first downloaded, fleet will calculate a fingerprint of the package. This fingerprint is used to determine if a package has changed. If a package has changed, fleet will rebuild it. If you have a package that you want to make sure is always rebuilt, you can set the CACHEPACKAGEID environment variable to be a random value. This will cause fleet to rebuild the package, no matter what. By default, fleet uses no parallelization. If you would like to enable parallelization, you can set the number of parallel jobs with the CONCURRENCY environment variable. The values of the environment variables listed here are used to populate the configuration file that fleet will use. If you need to set an option that isn't covered by an environment variable, you can set it in your configuration file. Fleet can be used with cargo.toml as well. To use fleet with cargo.toml, simply point fleet at the cargo.toml. On macOS, there is an option to use the clang LTO compiler. This can provide performance improvements and a reduction in build time. To enable this feature, set the CC environment variable to be clang."

Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite is being launched into Earth orbit on a rocket from the International Space Station (ISS). It will be deployed from the ISS on a date to be determined. LightSail 2 will be the first spacecraft to use light pressure as its primary means of propulsion. The spacecraft is equipped with a large, thin sail that will be used to collect sunlight and convert it into thrust. This will allow the spacecraft to travel into deep space without the need for traditional rockets. The LightSail 2 mission is a test of the technology that will be used to send future spacecraft to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. The mission is also expected to provide valuable data about the effects of light pressure on spacecraft."

Carl Sagan had envisioned a spacecraft that could be entirely powered through solar energy. After a few days in orbit, the LightSail 2 will unfurl its sails and start receiving soft pushes from the sun's rays. As the satellite will be in zero gravity, after 30 days, these small pushes will accumulate into a significant amount of momentum."

LLAMA,tldr-162,"The Planetary Society, an organization founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, is sending a small spacecraft to orbit the planet. Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite will be launched from SpaceX's Falcon Heavy later this month. If successful, the LightSail 2 will be the first spacecraft to be propelled by sunlight alone. The LightSail 2 is part of the Society's mission to prove that small, low-cost spacecraft can travel vast distances by using the sun's energy. The team plans to send the satellite to a higher orbit to see if solar sailing will be able to take the spacecraft beyond Earth's orbit. The LightSail 2 is a cubesat, a type of nanosatellite that has a 10-centimeter cube-shaped chassis. It will be launched into space on June 22. It will be attached to the aerospace company's Falcon Heavy launch vehicle along with 23 other satellites. According to the Planetary Society, the LightSail 2 will be released from the Falcon Heavy into a circular orbit 720 km above the Earth. After a few days, the LightSail 2 will deploy its solar sails. The satellite's four triangular sails will have a total area of 32 square meters. The LightSail 2 will be the first spacecraft to be propelled by solar power. The sails will be made of a special type of material that's only 4.5 microns thick. It is similar to the material used in Mylar balloons. The material will be coated with a reflective substance that will make it more durable and more reflective. The thin material will be pulled taut by the satellite's booms, which will unfurl to 4.5 meters. The booms will be made of a polyamide and fiberglass material that is stronger than steel but only a fraction of its weight. The satellite will be able to move by using solar pressure. Solar pressure is the small push exerted by the sunlight that strikes the sail. The pressure will slowly increase the spacecraft's orbital velocity over time. If the LightSail 2 succeeds, it will be the first spacecraft to be propelled by solar power alone. While it won't be used to travel to another planet, the LightSail 2 will prove that solar sailing is a viable form of space travel. For more space news, visit Cosmic.news."

Tsinghua,tldr-163,"Virgilio aims to help others navigate through the wide amount of information available on the internet and provide a clear and complete organic learning path for several tools, fields, skills, or concepts. Since the advent of social media, the development of any project, product, service, or organization has been greatly accelerated. Nowadays, if you are not online, you are not really existing. With all these changes and the incredible amounts of data, information, and knowledge being shared online, it is easy to get overwhelmed. In this chapter, we will provide a detailed overview of the information architecture (IA) for your website. The IA is the foundation of the online presence. It provides the structure and structure for the design, navigation, and organization of your website. Without a clear IA, your website will not be as effective as it could be. It will be difficult to navigate and use, and it will not help you attract your target audience. This chapter will explain the fundamentals of IA and provide you with practical examples. The Importance of IA for Your Website In the previous chapter, we talked about the importance of content for your website. However, the content of your website is not the only thing that makes your website successful. Your website's IA plays a very important role in the success of your online presence. When people search for a specific topic online, they do so with a clear intent. For example, when a user searches for online marketing , he or she is trying to find the best and most complete information about this topic. However, if the user's intention is to buy a product, then he or she is trying to find the best product. This is why your website's IA should be well-designed and clearly indicate the information and the links that are most relevant to your target audience. IA plays a very important role in determining the effectiveness of your website. When it comes to IA, there are several factors that you should keep in mind: The ease of navigation: This is the first thing that you need to think about. It is very important that your website's navigation is easy to use. The clarity of information: Your website should clearly indicate the information that your target audience is looking for. It should also clearly indicate the order in which this information is presented. The hierarchy of information: This refers to the order in which the information is presented on your website. For example, it is important that your website's content is organized in a logical and organized manner. The clarity of links: It is important that your website's links are clearly indicated. If your links are not clear, then your website will not be very effective. The Elements of IA We will discuss each of the above factors in this chapter. However, before we get into the details, we need to understand the fundamental elements of IA. The following diagram provides an overview of the elements of IA: The Importance of Keyword Density The importance of keyword density can be understood by looking at the previous diagram. For example, if you want to optimize your website for a specific keyword, you need to make sure that the keyword is present in your content. You can do this by including the keyword in the headings, the main content, the footer, the URLs, and so on. However, it is important to remember that keywords should not be present in the content in a random manner. They should be present in the content in a clear and logical manner. The keyword density should be between 0.5 and 2. If the keyword density is too high, then your website will not be optimized for that specific keyword. However, if the keyword density is too low, then your website will not be effective. The keyword density should be at the right level. The Importance of Keyword Position The keyword position refers to the position of the keyword in the keyword phrase. In other words, the keyword position refers to the position of the keyword in the keyword phrase. The keyword position is very important because it determines the importance of the keyword in the keyword phrase. The keyword position can be either first or last. If the keyword position is first, then it means that the keyword is very important. However, if the keyword position is last, then it means that the keyword is not very important. The Importance of Keyword Density and Position If you want to optimize your website for a specific keyword, then you need to make sure that the keyword is present in your content in a clear and logical manner. In addition, you also need to make sure that the keyword is present in the content in the right position. If you want to optimize your website for a specific keyword, then you need to make sure that the keyword is present in your content in a clear and logical manner."

If you often find yourself googling stuff like ""vertical align not working,"" you might want to keep reading. CSS layouts can be tricky, but mastering them is essential for creating modern, responsive websites. Here are a few tips to help you out: 1. Use Flexbox for simple layouts: Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout system that allows you to create flexible, responsive layouts with just a few lines of code. It's great for simple layouts where you need to align items vertically or horizontally. 2. Use Grid for complex layouts: Grid is another CSS layout system that's great for complex layouts with multiple rows and columns. It allows you to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, and is perfect for creating magazine-style designs. 3. Avoid floats: Floats used to be the go-to method for creating layouts, but they can be unpredictable and hard to work with. Flexbox and Grid are much more powerful and reliable, and should be used instead. 4. Try out CSS Grid Garden: If you're new to Grid, try out the fun and educational game CSS Grid Garden. It'll teach you the basics of Grid in a playful and engaging way. 5. Use modals sparingly: Modals are great for displaying information or forms that the user needs to interact with, but they can be overused. Try to use them only when necessary, and consider alternatives like showing and hiding elements instead. By mastering CSS layouts, you'll be able to create beautiful, responsive designs that work across all devices. Good luck!"

But then someone asks you to make the modal's background blue. Now what? Modals typically use multiple positioning techniques, so you'll have to override a few things to change its background color. Step 1: Decide where to put the blue background. I'm going to put it inside the modal element, but you could also put it in the dialog element. Step 2: Set the background color. Now the blue background covers everything inside the modal element. But we want to cover the entire modal, so we're not done. Step 3: Make the dialog element's padding go away. The dialog element has some default padding around its content. That padding doesn't show up when the modal is closed, but it does show up when the modal is open. So, let's get rid of it. Step 4: Make the modal element's height go away. The modal element is absolutely positioned, and it has a height of 100. That's what makes the modal cover the entire screen. But it also makes the modal cover the dialog's padding, which is too much. So, we'll set the height to 0. Step 5: Make the modal element cover the whole screen again. Now that the modal element has no height, it doesn't cover the entire screen. We want the blue background to cover the entire screen, so let's set the modal element's top and bottom values to 0. Step 6: Make the dialog element cover the entire modal. Since we removed the modal element's height, the dialog element doesn't stretch to fill the entire modal. We'll fix that by removing the dialog element's height. Congratulations! You've changed the modal's background color. But what if you want the blue background to cover everything except the dialog's content? This is called a ""modal background,"" and it's pretty easy to make. Step 1: Put the blue background inside the modal element. This time, we're going to put the blue background inside the modal element. Step 2: Put the dialog element inside the blue background. Now the dialog element is inside the blue background, but it doesn't cover the whole blue background. It needs a bit of padding around its content, so it doesn't touch the edges of the blue background. Step 3: Make the dialog element's padding cover the whole blue background. In the previous section, we used the padding property to remove the dialog element's padding, which is the amount of space around its content. But now we want to do the opposite, so let's use the padding property to create some space around the dialog element. Step 4: Make the dialog element cover the entire screen. The dialog element's content covers the entire screen, but its blue background doesn't cover the entire screen. So let's give the dialog element a height of 100. Step 5: Make the modal element cover the whole screen again. Now that we've put the dialog element inside the blue background, we can set the modal element's height to 100 again. If you're trying to make a modal, and you get stuck, try to figure out which elements you're missing. All modals have three elements. The outer element is the element that contains the entire modal. It's usually positioned relative. The container element is the element that contains the content inside the modal. It's usually positioned absolute. The content element is the element that contains the dialog's content. It's usually positioned relative. And if you need help with any of those elements, read this article."

""SIPC is not responsible for the loss of funds that are not part of a Member's segregated account."" ""SIPC protects cash that is deposited with a brokerage firm for one limited purpose and that is the purpose of purchasing securities. SIPC does not protect checking and savings accounts since the money has not been given to the broker to purchase securities.

While a Money Market Mutual Fund may seek to preserve the value of your investment at 1.00 per share, it is not guaranteed by SIPC.""

I will have to look at a different brokerage. masklinn Robinhood claiming a 3 interest rate but the actual interest rate was a lot lower. It was only 1.2. They are still not doing the accounts right. 1.2 interest is only 0.012 less than 0.003 (0.003365), it's just a rounding error and that's even before taxes.

That is actually a huge difference. If you have a 10000 in your account and have a 1.2 interest rate then your money is earning 1.20 a year, which is not very much. But if your account has a 0.012 interest rate then your money is earning 1.20 a year and it's more than you have in your account. masklinn If you have a 10000 in your account and have a 1.2 interest rate then your money is earning 1.20 a year, which is not very much. Yes, that's true. I was trying to say that they are not doing the accounts right. Robinhood is notorious for low interest rates on checking accounts, which makes them somewhat of an exception. sarah18000 I had this same problem with Robinhood - it would always ""incorrectly"" tell me I had over 5000 in my account. The app never actually gave me a sum. The best solution was to close the account, and open a new one.

There's still a good chance it's going to fall. diegomoita 1.2 is not that bad. The Robinhood fees are 0.05. In the US, you can open a savings account with a 0.1 interest rate (not guaranteed), which is more than 20 times better than Robinhood. In addition, you don't have to fill any forms. jmduke What is the downside of opening a savings account? I thought it was as simple as going to the bank and telling them you want to open an account, with your own money. (I know I could just use a bank that offers free checking and pay the savings interest in interest.) diegomoita The downside is that you can't withdraw your money when you need it. You have to ask the bank to give it to you. In addition, the bank has to keep it for you. jmduke Why do banks need to keep money for customers? I would have assumed they have reserves set aside to cover all withdrawals. danans Banks typically hold customer funds on deposit in their ""cash vaults"" which are actually owned by the bank. These vaults are protected by layers of physical and electronic security. In the event of a bank failure, the vaults are a critical asset for the FDIC to provide for depositor protection."

BigScience,tldr-170,"The International Space Station is supposed to retire in 2024, though that date will probably be pushed back to 2030. It is slowly leaking air and getting increasingly expensive to fly. So the Russian space agency Roscosmos wants to do a big job of upgrading it before it's too late: This week we were able to carry out preparations for launching of our spacecraft into orbit around Earth from the Japanese Pacific island Hokkaido [...] The launch technology for this mission was developed by engineers at JAXA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which has been working on similar systems since 1997 (via NASASpaceflight) In one sense they are right - the ISS costs more than ever to maintain as its ongoing operations have become so complicated. And now NASA has backed down on plans to upgrade the station after several months of argument between Congress and their administration over budget cuts."
LLAMA,tldr-170,"The International Space Station is supposed to retire in 2024, though that date will probably be pushed back to 2030. It is slowly leaking air and getting increasingly expensive to maintain. A commercial space station is a real possibility, and NASA is open to it, but it is not a given. NASA's initial estimates were that the International Space Station would cost 8 billion to build and maintain. That number ended up being off by a factor of four. It cost 35 billion to get the ISS into orbit. That is about 60 billion in today's money. In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope, an amazing piece of space technology, cost 1.5 billion in 1990, or about 2.9 billion in today's dollars. The International Space Station is one of the greatest human achievements. It is a testament to our engineering and technological prowess. But like any home it needs maintenance and upkeep. Even with the best maintenance, things break and need to be fixed. Space walks are the most expensive type of repairs. It takes astronauts about 300 hours to prepare for a space walk. Two astronauts spent 22 hours installing a replacement coolant pump on the ISS in 2010. This repair cost an estimated 110 million. One of the major costs of maintaining the ISS is sending things up in rockets. A rocket launch costs around 200 million. These rockets need to be sent up periodically to supply the station with food, water, and other necessities. The International Space Station will need to be de-orbited and destroyed when it is no longer useful. Currently, the ISS orbits 240 miles above the Earth's surface. De-orbiting it will be an expensive task that will take a lot of time and resources. The International Space Station is a modern marvel. It has been in operation since 1998 and has been visited by over 200 astronauts from 15 different countries. It has been used as a space observatory, a space laboratory, and a space hotel. It has allowed us to perform experiments in microgravity and observe our home from a vantage point that was previously unimaginable. But the International Space Station is an old space station. And like all old homes, it requires a lot of maintenance. It is expensive to keep up. The United States alone spends about 3 to 4 billion per year on the International Space Station. That is a lot of money for a country with over 21 trillion in debt. In this article, we will explore some of the costs of maintaining the International Space Station. We will also explore whether it is worth continuing to use the space station or whether it is time to de-orbit it and replace it with a new space station. The International Space Station was first imagined in 1984. It was the result of a collaboration between the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and the European Space Agency. The space station would be an international scientific laboratory. It would allow astronauts from different countries to live and work together in space. In the beginning, the International Space Station was envisioned as a much smaller space station. It was supposed to cost 8 billion to build and maintain over 10 years. The projected cost of the space station ballooned to 35 billion by 1993, the year the first component was launched. The United States agreed to pay for 25 billion of the cost. This was a pretty penny considering the United States had a budget deficit of about 300 billion that year. The International Space Station had a rough beginning. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster of 1986, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster of 2003 all threatened to derail the project. But the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, and 11 members of the European Space Agency remained committed to the space station. The International Space Station was constructed piece by piece over the course of a decade. It was launched in parts and assembled in space. Each component was launched into space by a Space Shuttle or a Russian Proton rocket. The first component was the Russian Zarya module. It was launched in November 1998.

BigScience,tldr-172,"A good friend of mine recently started an ecommerce business called Drunk Shrub, it sells shrub, a tangy syrup that you can mix with alcoholic beverages or carbonated water to make them tastier. We talked about how her vision for the brand was pretty similar to my own but there is one major distinction in how I see this brand growing. For me at least, names are important because they essentially set up expectations and therefore influence your perception when interacting with someone. It also helps people take action by making them feel more comfortable asking what's available before considering purchasing such products as yours (or anyone else). I've discovered over time though that it's not always necessary to have strong branding behind your product name if you're just getting into e-commerce - especially since most customers aren't aware of who you really are yet so why bother giving yourself any extra work? In fact, even though I know myself personally through social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook I'm sure none of us has mentioned our full real identity online much less created a fake persona out of it. The reason being we don't want things to get too personal and embarrassing which might lead to negative feedback from other members within their circles. So instead I recommend starting small and having fun while still exploring where this journey takes you! Aside from trying different brands and scouting potential suppliers you need to start defining your target audience by identifying demographics, interests concerning lifestyle preferences on buying habits etc. This way you wouldn't waste resources marketing wrongly and thus eventually become part of the problem rather than solving it. Once that's done you'll then have a clearer idea on how best to approach your prospective clients and build rapport using appropriate channels. For example if you're targeting younger folks to promote self-expression, you'd better choose a channel shortlisted specifically for youth and include visuals in posts showing off happy moments. Another thing worth pointing out here is that each client should receive individual attention based upon hisher preference regardless of whether he's new to the communitybrand or longtime fans. You may think ""sure!"" but those messages can easily go unnoticed if others keep posting updates without taking notice of responses and views left. Therefore focus on building genuine connections with fellow shoppers first before moving forward with sending direct offers. If you sell unique items such as organic teas, homemade soft serve ice creams, vintage clothing or knick-knacks, remember to capture interest among local or regional communities. Trying something special doesn't necessarily mean creating content; providing discounts or free shipping for orders above certain amount could do wonders. It's never right to forget affordability either although appealing prices usually creates demand. Just ensure all costs involved remain reasonable allowing everyone to pay according to themselves' existing budget. One particular tactic I've found quite useful involves sharing interesting facts regarding popular culture, pop-culture trends and telling stories related to your industry along with relevant imagery. In my case for instance I often post photos illustrating the story of my life embedded inside the context of agriculture alongside references to food safety regulations and healthy eating habits. I'm currently working on another project involving farming animals for human consumption and I'd love for you to check it out soon at By nowyou probably understand why naming your brand (s) shouldn't simply happen randomly. If nothing else it will help establish credibility and give away many aspects of the company including its core values, expertise, strengths, weaknesses and future plans. However, if you're unable to find anything suitable consider incorporating elements such as natural ingredients, animal welfare practices, vegan-friendly meals andor environmentally friendly activities amongst other concepts according to your niche market. The point of acronym is that they're easier to remember compared to longer words - no matter if they link back to your original intentions or not. However, this technique won't instantly attract thousands of followers unless you create some genuinely impressive contents to support your claims. Keep writing quality articles, share photosvideos featuring various angles highlighting beauty, style tips and home decoration ideas. You'd better avoid talking purely about yourself and instead highlight positive points made by your competitors plus try putting together reviews written by satisfied consumers. Remember that success hinges largely on finding balance between authenticity vs. exaggeration; instructional info vs. sales promotions. However, try aiming for high standards both internally and externally throughout your entire blogging process. Becoming famous requires maturation through consistent efforts and doing great job outside means improving everything around you inside. It's hard enough for competitor sites to catch up due to lack of advertising money now let alone if you're going low-key. So choose carefully. Whether you use images to illustrate your text or vice versa - adding captivating background designs to your blog pages definitely makes readers experience your website as enticing as possible. Don't hesitate to invest some effort establishing a user-friendly interface combining sophisticated design techniques and modern tech tools enabling viewers to navigate freely across features offered. Although keeping up with current technological advancements seems exciting initially, setting priorities saves valuable time helping to bridge gaps in communication between staff members and external partners alike. Sharing news with customers via email regularly allows you to stay connected in addition to nudging them towards engaging more with each other on social"

An analysis of the spinosaurid's jaws found that it had no teeth on its front upper incisor. A study published in Nature Communications by paleontologists at the University of Texas (UT) Austin offers evidence for how an animal might have evolved to live underground. Scientists led by UT researchers Michael Carroll, Thomas Seufert, Jonathan Shubin and Philip Osorio reported they studied fossils collected from Mexican caves near Palmira, Mexico in 2012-2014. The animals were known as ichthyosaurs because there are fish-like slits along their skin called pectoral scutes that exposed organs such as lungs underneath them.

LLAMA,tldr-173,"Iberospinus natarioi, a newly identified 8-meter-long predatory dinosaur, represents a new genus and species of spinosaurid, a group that includes the Spinosaurus. An analysis of the spinosaurid's jaws found that it belonged to the most complete dinosaur skull yet found in Europe. The skull, which was discovered in Portugal in 1999, is being presented in the journal Cretaceous Research. The fossil was embedded in the rock of the Guimarota mine, a large-scale open pit coal mine. Since its discovery, the fossil has been studied and prepared by researchers in Portugal and Spain. Spinosaurids were a group of large carnivorous dinosaurs that first appeared about 170 million years ago and were extinct by about 90 million years ago. They had distinctive skulls, with long snouts and sharp teeth, and were adapted to eat fish and other aquatic animals. The group includes some of the longest predatory dinosaurs known to science. Spinosaurid fossils have been found in Europe, North Africa and South America. Iberospinus is the second spinosaurid found in Europe, and the second in Portugal. It is the first known dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Iberia, a region of the Iberian Peninsula. It lived about 150 million years ago. The fossil is the most complete dinosaur skull found in Europe and has a number of unique characteristics. One of the most striking is the presence of a long spike-like snout. The snout is long and narrow, with a long skull that is similar to the skull of other spinosaurids. The researchers identified three key features that led to the classification of the fossil as a new species. It has three skull openings - a large one in the middle of the skull and two others near the tip of the snout. The fossil also shows that the skull was covered with a thick layer of bone. The features are distinct from other spinosaurids. The researchers also discovered that the new species has a number of unique features in the skull bones that are found in other spinosaurids. These features may have helped the spinosaurid to catch and consume its prey. The fossil, which was found in the Late Jurassic strata, suggests that this dinosaur lived alongside a diverse group of dinosaurs, including the giant herbivorous dinosaurs called diplodocids. The fossil was discovered in the Guimarota mine, a large-scale open pit coal mine. The mine, which is located in the Leiria District in central Portugal, is an area rich in dinosaur fossils. In 2001, researchers reported that they had discovered an 8-inch (20-centimeter) claw from a theropod dinosaur in the Guimarota mine. The theropod, which was later named Baryonyx galae, lived about 130 million years ago. It was the first dinosaur discovered in the mine. A second dinosaur, Alocodon kuehnei, was discovered in 2002. It also lived about 130 million years ago. In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of two new species of dinosaurs in the mine. They included an unusual plant-eating dinosaur and a theropod dinosaur. The new fossils were described in the scientific journal PLOS ONE. Both fossils are from the Jurassic period, which lasted from 200 million to 145 million years ago. The plant-eating dinosaur was a member of a group known as diplodocoids, which includes sauropods like Diplodocus and Brontosaurus. The theropod was a member of the Allosaurus family."

Replacement teeth aren't uncommon in spinosaurids, but this species' system allowed for a much faster turnaround time. Its teeth were also serrated.

The Iberospinus natarioi is believed to have lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 95 million years ago, in what is now Portugal. Its discovery provides new insights into the diversity and evolution of the spinosaurid group and adds to our understanding of the ecosystems that existed during the Late Cretaceous period."

Remediate vulnerabilities As an AI language model, I do not have access to Cloudflare or any other organization's infrastructure. However, I can suggest some general best practices to fix vulnerabilities at scale: 1. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments: To detect vulnerabilities at scale, it's crucial to conduct regular vulnerability assessments across your IT infrastructure. 2. Prioritize vulnerabilities: Once you identify vulnerabilities, prioritize them based on severity and the potential impact they may have on your organization. 3. Develop a plan of action: Based on your priority list, develop a plan of action to remediate vulnerabilities. This should include identifying the necessary resources and timelines to fix the vulnerabilities. 4. Automate where possible: Automating vulnerability remediation can help to speed up the process and scale the remediation capabilities. 5. Leverage technology: Leverage tools such as vulnerability scanners, patch management systems, and continuous integration and delivery (CICD) pipelines to streamline the vulnerability remediation process. 6. Educate employees: Educate employees on how to identify and report vulnerabilities. This creates a culture of security, making it easier to detect and remediate vulnerabilities at scale. These are some general practices to remediate vulnerabilities at scale. However, each organization is unique, and the remediation process may vary based on infrastructure, policies, and security requirements."
Human,tldr-177,"The US military has been building a massive database with millions of images of faces, irises, fingerprints, and DNA data over the last 15 years. There are at least 7.4 million identities in the Automated Biometric Information System, including the identities of suspected terrorists and allied soldiers training with the US forces. The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency is tasked with overseeing the database. This information was used thousands of times in the first half of 2019 to identify non-US citizens on the battlefield. It is linked to the FBI's biometric database, so the US military can search against the biometric data of US citizens as well. This network will ultimately amount to a global surveillance system. The US military has invested over 345 million in biometric database technology in the last 10 years. Much about the system is still unknown, including its accuracy rate at identifying individuals correctly."

There are at least 7.4 million images of faces in the database, which is more than the total number of people living in New York City. The database is growing by about 100,000 new images per day. The military says that the database is used for security purposes, such as identifying potential threats and preventing terrorist attacks. However, civil liberties groups have raised concerns about the database, saying that it could be used for mass surveillance or to target political dissidents. In 2015, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense, alleging that the database violates the Fourth Amendment. The lawsuit is still pending. The military has defended the database, saying that it is necessary for national security. However, the debate over the database is likely to continue for years to come."
Tsinghua,tldr-177,"The US military has been building a massive database with millions of images of faces, irises, fingerprints, and DNA data over the last 15 years. There are at least 7.4 million people in the database, and some 1.3 million of them are suspected terrorists. The database contains more than 550 million data points. In this country, the number of terrorist plots and attacks has been falling steadily since 911. However, it is estimated that only 25 percent of those plots have been successfully thwarted, and that only 10 percent of those plots are being prevented by current security measures. A study from the Department of Homeland Security found that there are currently 20,000 people in the US that are ""at risk"" of being radicalized to commit an act of terrorism. And the US is not the only country that is struggling to stop terrorism. According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, governments around the world have spent an estimated 20 billion to combat terrorism. The report states that ""nearly all terrorist groups"" are currently active in the US, Europe, and the Middle East. And there are many more terrorist cells in the pipeline. And yet, despite this massive investment, there has been no reduction in terrorism. So what gives? A number of reasons have been offered as to why terrorism has not declined in recent years. One is that the US government is waging a so-called ""war on terror."" Another is that there is a failure of technology. And a third is that there is a failure of public policy. It has been claimed that the war on terror is ""misguided"" and has been ""embarrassing."" Some have suggested that the US has ""wasted billions of dollars on military and intelligence efforts"" and has been ""deeply ineffective."" And yet, it is also claimed that this failure has been ""inevitable"" and that the US is ""too large"" to ""prevent every terrorist attack."" However, a recent report from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) argues that these claims are not accurate. The report states that there are many different types of terrorism and that these different types of terrorism ""have not only varied in their success rate but also in their ability to survive and thrive in an environment hostile to their cause."" According to the report, it is important to understand the distinctions between terrorism and extremist violence, and to understand that there is ""no one-size-fits-all"" approach to dealing with terrorism. The report also suggests that the current ""war on terror"" may be making things worse, and that the failure of the war on terror is being ""overstated."" According to the report, there is no evidence that ""the US has spent billions of dollars on military and intelligence efforts to fight terrorism,"" and that the US has not been ""deeply ineffective"" in the war on terror. And it is also argued that the failure of the war on terror is ""inevitable"" and ""not inevitable."" And it is also argued that there is no ""war on terror"" in the first place."
BigScience,tldr-177,"The US military has been building a massive database with millions of images of faces, irises, fingerprints, and DNA data over the last 15 years. There are at least 7.4 billion items in that database - back to when it started. In order for this project to work smoothly, it needs to be computerised so every image is scanned into a big file before being linked up against existing databases. ""We've got like 90 million people who've had their pictures taken since 1996. So just given those numbers alone... it's going to take us maybe 20 or 30 years to scan all these photos if we do it manually on paper. But that's what we're trying to avoid doing by using machine vision technology instead where you can check each photo very quickly versus taking an hour, two hours reviewing one picture at a time,"" says Dr David King from Melbourne's Centre for Intelligent Security Research (CISR). It also means there will only need to be three copies: one kept in the commander's office, another at storage facility in Hawaii, and a third held as a backup somewhere. ""This allows our commands to have full access to the information without having to constantly ask intelligence agencies for permission or get around restrictions imposed by some governments overseas because they may not want any sort of disclosure happening here in Australia, but perhaps they would allow disclosures elsewhere,"" he explains. Using facial recognition software, soldiers must now briefly show their face while holding an object, such as a baggage tag. A prototype system developed by CISR uses image processing techniques to compare the new picture to previously stored ones. (Supplied) If the recogniser identifies something different than expected - which typically happens when someone looks deceptively similar or mistakenly matches someone's father - then it flags the person down for further investigation. This initial match does mean there's no guarantee that individuals' identities will remain anonymous after they're photographed. Like most security systems run by private corporations today, there isn't much protection for personal privacy under Australia's national security laws. Why no way out There is more regulation about how government agencies conduct surveillance including biometric monitoring, but it doesn't go beyond basic guidelines that companies can't knowingly collect private details about their customers unless they explicitly provide consent - often verbally. Right now, however, the whole point of digital biometrics is to make life easier for business managers rather than making citizens safer. Australian armed forces commander General Mark Thompson said the use of cameras to monitor soldiers was ""inevitable"" during warfare. He told ABC Radio National's World Today program that keeping tabs on troops could help ensure troop morale didn't dry up too soon. But others think even civilians deserve better supervision through law enforcement organisations and independent judges. Former Supreme Court Justice Tony Wilson argues Australians should expect less intrusion into their lives once everyone's seen plenty of action films featuring heavy hand-holding between cops and criminals. Wilson believes Australia's gun controls were unnecessary yet never changed despite mounting evidence of mass shootings across Europe and America.

LLAMA,tldr-177,"The US military has been building a massive database with millions of images of faces, irises, fingerprints, and DNA data over the last 15 years. There are at least 7.4 million entries, which includes 2.2 million belonging to US citizens. The images are collected from people in Afghanistan and Iraq and are used to identify potential suspects in intelligence investigations. However, there is no public accounting of the exact number of Americans' images that have been collected by the military over the years. In addition to faces and fingerprints, the collection includes biometric information from other body parts such as irises and DNA, as well as data on scars, tattoos and physical markings. The images are used to identify people in intelligence investigations. In the military's most recent fiscal year, the database received more than 100,000 new files, but it is unclear how many of them were of US citizens. The Military Department of Defense collected 2.2 million images of American citizens over a period of five years, according to data obtained by Gizmodo under the Freedom of Information Act. The images come from both civilians and military personnel who have had their biometric data collected over the past five years. The records show that the collection started in 2011, when the Military Department of Defense (MDA) started collecting biometric data on a large scale. In 2011, the MDA collected 9,200 images of American citizens, and in 2016, it collected more than 240,000. The data includes images from US passports and visas, as well as other public records. The collection of images of citizens started in 2011, when the MDA began collecting biometric data on a large scale. In 2011, the MDA collected 9,200 images of American citizens, and in 2016, it collected more than 240,000. The data includes images from US passports and visas, as well as other public records. The database has grown tremendously over the years, according to the documents obtained by Gizmodo, and the collection of Americans' data has grown with it. In 2016, the database had approximately 2.2 million images of citizens. The Military Department of Defense has not commented on the information. The new data obtained by Gizmodo is part of the military's Automated Biometric Identification System, or ABIS, which contains fingerprints, photos, iris scans, and other biometric data for use by the military and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The collection of data is part of an effort to identify the perpetrators of terrorist attacks. According to the MDA, the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. The system is used to identify people in intelligence investigations and has become an ""essential tool"" in the war on terrorism. The MDA used ABIS to identify a suspect in the terrorist attack in Brussels in 2016, which is an example of how the database can be used to help identify people in a large-scale investigation. Biometric data has been collected by the military in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2004. The first records of the system include a collection of 100,000 images taken from detainees and civilians who were used as witnesses. The collection of data was authorized by the President of the United States to help identify potential suspects in terrorism. In 2008, the military's data was combined with the FBI's database, creating one of the largest biometric databases in the world. The FBI has more than 131 million records in its system, and the military is just one of the agencies that has access to the records of the FBI.

OpenAI,tldr-177,"The US military has been building a massive database with millions of images of faces, irises, fingerprints, and DNA data over the last 15 years. There are at least 7.4 million faces in the database, as well as 6.5 million sets of iris scans, 117,000 fingerprints and 61,000 DNA samples. This database, known as the DoD's Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS), was originally created to help identify individuals who were captured or killed on the battlefield. However, it has since expanded to include both military and civilian individuals who have come into contact with the US military, such as those applying for a job position with the military or those seeking to enter military bases. The purpose of this database is to enhance security and protect against potential terrorist threats. It allows the military to quickly identify individuals who have ties to known terrorist organizations or who may pose a threat to national security. However, the use of biometric data also raises concerns about privacy and data security. There have been instances where hackers have gained access to government databases and stolen sensitive information, so it is essential that the military takes appropriate measures to ensure the security of this data."

The files in question are associated with an app called ""Apple Reality Reality,"" which would make sense if Apple was planning to release a new operating system that would allow for mixed reality experiences. The file name contains the letter ""O"" in a number of places, so it could be a name for a new iPhone or iPad.

BigScience,tldr-178,"Software developers have discovered references to a new Apple operating system, realityOS, in App Store upload logs and GitHub repositories. Apple has been known to be working on a mixed -reality project since at least the early 2000s. A device using reality OS wouldn't require accessories like headsets or goggles - it could just work with your smartphone's camera, screen display, microphone and speakers. Another catch is that although you'd likely need to buy an iPhone 6 Plus or similar for standalone use, having one of those devices as part of a family setup where everyone uses their own phone might make sense: each person can play his or her own video game while another member of the group controls things from a different angle. (It also means no more sharing screens.) This sort of multi-user experience was introduced last year when Facebook launched its Daydream virtual reality platform. The real question now is: How long before this technology becomes widespread? For starters, we're still waiting to see if Google will support Augmented Reality (AR) phones in the Pixel 3 series alongside regular smartphones; it's not clear whether any other major OEMs are doing so either. Also, there seems to be some confusion about which mobile platforms include ARCore support. As reported by 9to5mac yesterday, Mac users can't run AR apps because Intel doesn't provide software drivers needed for the chips used in iPhones, but Android does enable such functionality. There's also something else going on: In February, Qualcomm announced that all future gaming consoles supporting next-gen graphics cards must support Real-Time Ray Tracing (RTX).

LLAMA,tldr-178,"Software developers have discovered references to a new Apple operating system, realityOS, in App Store upload logs and GitHub repositories. Apple has been known to be working on a mixed reality system, with the ARKit already available in iOS 11 and iOS 12. Apple's augmented reality system is called ARKit, and it's been available on iOS devices since the launch of iOS 11 last year. ARKit is the software development kit that allows developers to create augmented reality experiences. iOS 12, released earlier this month, brought with it the second generation of ARKit, and Apple has been continuously refining the ARKit with additional features. This is done by using motion tracking data from the gyroscope and camera, and is able to place digital objects in real-world environments. These objects are then able to react to the changing environment. The iPad has the largest screen of any iOS device, which makes it the perfect platform for augmented reality experiences. A larger screen means more room for virtual objects, and Apple has been pushing for AR experiences on the iPad ever since the launch of iOS 11. Though Apple is yet to announce a dedicated headset, many are expecting the launch of a new Apple headset, running a special version of iOS for virtual and augmented reality experiences. The ARKit has already been used to develop a range of AR experiences. For example, ARKit has been used to create a Harry Potter game, and many other experiences. However, in order to deliver a truly immersive AR experience, a headset is needed, and that's where the Apple headset comes in. Details about the headset are not yet known, but if Apple is to launch an AR headset, it will likely be running some variant of iOS, which is why developers are now speculating that Apple is preparing a special version of iOS, called realityOS, for the new headset. As mentioned, references to realityOS have been found in App Store upload logs, and in code for Apple's Xcode. This code has revealed that Apple is using Xcode to work on realityOS, and is integrating it with the existing iOS. Another interesting aspect is that Apple has already been hiring developers for its AR and virtual reality teams, with Apple hiring some developers from Lytro, and also engineers from Leap Motion. Apple is not new to the virtual and augmented reality space, and has filed various patents and has made acquisitions to boost its presence in the AR market. Apple's interest in AR and VR extends beyond the iPad, and the company has also been rumored to be working on an AR headset, possibly called Apple Glasses. Apple is yet to make any announcements regarding its AR headset, but it could be announced next month at the Apple event. Apple is set to unveil a new line of iPhones, along with a new MacBook, and a new Apple Watch. The headset might not be ready yet, but some rumors have indicated that it could be unveiled next month. There are not many details about the headset available, but the iPhone maker has been hiring new employees with expertise in the augmented and virtual reality market. This has included some big names, such as the founder of HoloLens, Avi Bar-Zeev, who left Microsoft in January to join Apple. Apple has also filed a number of patents for VR and AR devices. One of the more interesting patents was filed last year, and it detailed a new headset with displays for each eye, and a number of outward facing cameras, that would capture the world around you. The images captured by the outward facing cameras would be displayed on the headset's displays, with virtual objects being overlaid on top of these images. A similar patent was filed by Apple earlier this year, in which the company detailed a number of different ways in which the headset could be used, including for gaming, as well as watching movies. Apple is yet to announce any AR headset, but it's not the only company looking to release a virtual reality or augmented reality headset. Facebook has been working on its own virtual reality headset, called Oculus Go, while Samsung and Google are also working on virtual and augmented reality headsets. It's been rumored that Apple's headset could be released as early as 2020, but it's likely that the headset will require a new version of iOS, which is where realityOS will come in. A realityOS could be Apple's way of competing with Android in the VR and AR market."

Tsinghua,tldr-179,"Light from stars tend to pulsate uniformly across the whole surface of a star. Astronomers have discovered a teardrop-shaped object that only pulses from one side. The star is about 100,000 light years away from Earth. The new study, published in the journal Astronomy Astrophysics, has been confirmed by a number of independent observers. The star is called LS 100445 and is one of the first pulsars discovered in 1974. The pulsar is a massive, rotating neutron star with an enormous magnetic field. As the star rotates, the magnetic field lines sweep out a glowing region called the neutron star's ""light cylinder,"" which is the radius at which light can move around the star. The pulsar is known to pulsate at a rate of about 100 times per second. This star has a surface that's the same size as Earth, but its diameter is only about 400,000 kilometers (250,000 miles). This means that the surface of the star is the size of a softball. But this pulsar is unique. ""This pulsar is the only one that we know of where the light only pulses from one side,"" said Marcella Baldo, a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. The researchers used the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, a satellite that measures the timing of pulses of X-rays emitted from the star, to measure the pulsations. The star pulsates about 100 times per second, which is what astronomers would expect from a rotating neutron star. But, the researchers found that the pulsar also has pulsations that are occurring at a much slower rate, about 100,000 times per second. This suggests that there are two sources of light from the star, and that one of the sources is not rotating. ""We were able to detect the other component of the light from the pulsar,"" Baldo said. ""This light was different from the 100-times-per-second component of the light. It was a slow, rotating component."" The slow component of the light was also seen in other X-ray pulsars, which suggests that this is not a rare occurrence. But, because LS 100445 is a very bright X-ray source, it is easier to see the slow component of the light. The researchers found that the light from the slow component of the star has a slower frequency than the fast component of the light, suggesting that it has a different physical origin. ""We can't explain it with our current understanding of the physics of neutron stars,"" Baldo said. ""But we can't rule out any of the possibilities."" In the future, the researchers plan to analyze more data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and to use data from other X-ray telescopes to look for the slow component of the light. ""If we find the slow component of the light, we can determine what the physical source of this component is,"" Baldo said. The researchers will also look for the slow component of the light in other pulsars. The research was supported by NASA.

The unique shape came after researchers observed this Teegarden Object with high-resolution imaging at NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on Earth and Hubble Space Telescope on space. They also used data collected by the European Southern Observatory's Gaia mission in orbit around nearby sun-like star GJ 876B. Astronomers first detected the unusual planetary nebula in 2010 when they noticed it was dimming more quickly than usual - probably due to an expanding shell that had become thicker on its bright, central axis.

We think it's likely related to how much hydrogen gas there is inside - but that's just speculation right now because no-one has actually measured these parameters outside of objects where the clumps of material have collapsed into smaller spots and made it easier for astrometry satellites to measure their positions."" Meech and colleagues then set up observations using the Spitzer telescope aboard the International Space Station (ISS) which allowed scientists to pin-point exactly when the Teegarden Object began expelling its hydrogen-rich gases: It happened over the course of two weeks instead of just one day or even three hours. This could mean the progenitor star wasn't fully ionized immediately upon birth and remained partially neutral until later on. ""If you want to know something about your young star, a few days will be plenty long enough,"" explained astronomer David Bowler, who led another group of observers involved in this study. ""The most important thing here however is not knowing precisely why certain types of variation occur, but having evidence that such events happen all along the way! So the fact that we were able to detect variations during both phases indicates this planet might represent a transitional object between the initial stages before the star becomes mostly ionised and finally completely blown apart into a supernova explosion. If we can find more examples of this behavior among others similar ones, it would help establish that some sort of long-term effect exists and that the pulsations aren't entirely epiphenomenological."""
LLAMA,tldr-179,"Light from stars tend to pulsate uniformly across the whole surface of a star. Astronomers have discovered a teardrop-shaped object that only pulses from one side. The star is about 1000 light-years away, and a little smaller than our sun. A nebula nearby is also pulsing with light, and it is believed that the nebula is created by the star. It is unknown what is causing the star to behave in this way. However, it is believed that the energy from the nebula is changing the way the star is pulsating. While the star was already known to pulsate in a unique way, the new images from the Hubble Space Telescope show that the star's brightness changes over time, brightening and dimming about every 25 days. The nebula has clouds of dust and gas in the center. Astronomers believe that the energy from the star is causing the nebula to pulse. ""The discovery of this unique object is very exciting,"" said Dr. Henri Boffin, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory, in a statement. ""This is the first time we have observed a star that changes its shape in response to its pulsations."" Astronomers are now working to find out what is causing the star to pulsate this way. They are also working to find out why the nebula is pulsating in time with the star. The discovery of this unique star has led to the researchers having many questions about it. They hope to find answers as they continue to study the star and the nebula. The findings were published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."

Tsinghua,tldr-180,"Rutgers engineers have created a 3D-printed smart gel that changes shape when exposed to light and a 3D-printed stretchy material that can reveal colors when the light changes. These developments are among the first steps in a series of research efforts at the University to develop new materials that respond to light and environmental changes. ""There are many different ways to manipulate light, and the exciting thing about this work is that it can have applications in a variety of areas,"" said lead author Matthew V. Nicholls, a postdoctoral researcher in mechanical engineering. ""In medicine, we could use it to treat wounds and burns; in robotics, it could be used to control robotic grippers and limbs; and in electronics, it could be used to create wearable devices and smart materials."" The study was published online in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. 3D printing has become a promising tool for creating new materials, but it has been limited in its ability to create materials that respond to light, Nicholls said. The new research, however, has provided a step toward developing 3D-printed materials that can change shape and color in response to light, he said. The researchers developed a 3D-printed gel made of light-responsive polymers and metal oxide nanoparticles. When exposed to light, the gel swells and becomes a little less dense. As a result, it changes shape. ""We were able to create a material that responds to light in the visible range, but we could also potentially create a material that responds to light in the infrared range,"" Nicholls said. The researchers also created a stretchy material that changes color when exposed to light. The material consists of a gel sandwiched between layers of transparent polymers. When exposed to light, the gel expands and the material stretches, making the layers of polymer shift apart and creating a color change. ""This is a very simple system that we can control very precisely,"" Nicholls said. ""The process is really elegant and straightforward, and it's easy to use and easy to implement."" The researchers created both materials using a 3D-printing technique called fused deposition modeling, which uses a laser to melt the polymer, depositing the material in layers. The researchers then developed a simple, inexpensive device that can sense and record the changes in the materials. The device consists of a light-emitting diode, a photodetector and a camera. The researchers are currently developing a prototype device to study the materials. ""We are trying to find ways to use these materials in a wide range of applications,"" Nicholls said. ""For example, the gel could be used to develop smart gels for drug delivery and wound care."

LLAMA,tldr-181,"Brewster Kahle founded Alexa Internet and the Internet Archive on the same day in 1996. Alexa was acquired by Amazon in a deal worth 250 million and converted into an analytics service. The Internet Archive was founded with the vision of storing copies of every website in the world, and is currently in the process of doing exactly that. Kahle has been a technological innovator, entrepreneur, and advocate since the beginning of the web. He has worked with the Internet Archive since 1996, creating what is today a home for the millions of books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. At the Internet Archive's headquarters in San Francisco, Kahle shows us the Wayback Machine, the Petabox, and a book scanner. The Internet Archive is a digital library of free media, including books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages. The Archive has not limited itself to collecting the digitized works of others. It now creates its own digital versions of other published works, as well as of live public domain films. The organization also oversees the Wayback Machine archive, which preserves the web pages of now defunct websites. When Kahle founded the Internet Archive in 1996, he envisioned it as a library of the Internet - a place where anyone could go and find information that has since been lost to the digital ether. Today, the Archive is growing at an enormous pace, thanks to Kahle's unending energy and vision. The Archive is home to 150 million books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Was the Internet Archive created to archive the Internet? Kahle: We founded the Internet Archive on April 30, 1996. The World Wide Web was 1,500 days old. It was that young. The Archive was a library that you might build to collect the last 1,500 days of the Internet. That was the plan at the beginning. We would keep a copy of every website. Today, it is a library that keeps a copy of every website, and it is a library that keeps a copy of every book, and it is a library that keeps a copy of every TV show, and every movie, and all the software. It is the library for the world. Was this the first time you have ever tried to archive something? Kahle: I was an archivist before I was an entrepreneur. My first job was in a library, where I worked in the rare book room, which was a place that they kept copies of the books that no one else had, and that is the kind of job that I loved. It is the kind of job that led to the Internet Archive. What have been some of the major challenges? Kahle: Everything at the beginning. There were no books to scan, no one who wanted to help us. We had no money, so we had to try to figure out a way to get books to scan, and to get people to help us. We had to figure out how to get money so that we could pay for the books to be scanned. What is the Wayback Machine? Kahle: The Wayback Machine is the website where you can go and find an older version of a webpage. You can see how it used to be in the past. It is a very handy thing. It is the library card catalog, or the index, or the Dewey Decimal System. The Wayback Machine is the index for the Library of Alexandria. Kahle: It is basically a very fast scanner. It turns the pages and takes a picture. It turns the pages and takes a picture. It turns the pages and takes a picture. It does this very quickly. Then, it has a bar code scanner, so that we know what page it is that we are looking at. A book is put on, it is scanned, and in the end, we have a digital book. It is very fast. The pages turn very quickly. It can do a book a minute. It can do 1,000 books in a day. It is a machine that is scanning all the books in the library.

The risk was even higher for people who ate large amounts of processed meat, such as bacon, sausage, and hot dogs. The researchers believe that the high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol in red and processed meats may be responsible for the increased risk of kidney cancer. These compounds can damage the kidneys and make them more susceptible to cancer. The study's findings add to the growing body of evidence linking red and processed meat consumption to a variety of health problems.

Researchers have reported that there is no need to drastically cut back on red and processed meats. The relationship between the two and heart disease has been so controversial that some scientists have argued that there is no such thing as a ""good"" or ""bad"" meat. However, a new study conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan found that the long-term consumption of red meat and processed meat did not have a significant impact on heart disease. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, was based on a database of more than 100,000 people and examined their eating habits and rates of heart disease. The researchers found that red and processed meat intake was not linked to heart disease in people of all ages, with or without risk factors for heart disease. Dr. Scott Sobel, professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Michigan and the study's lead author, said, ""We were surprised by the lack of association between meat intake and risk of heart disease."" The researchers found that red and processed meat intake was not linked to a significantly higher risk of heart disease in any of the study's age groups, regardless of risk factors. The study's findings are important because it found that there was no association between red and processed meat intake and heart disease in people who were at a low risk of heart disease. This is significant because, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with higher rates of heart disease are less likely to change their eating habits. In fact, many patients who have a history of heart disease often try to avoid the foods they have been warned about in the past, which can lead to poor health. The researchers said, ""To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine meat intake and risk of heart disease in the general population."" The study's findings are important because it found that there was no association between red and processed meat intake and heart disease in people who were at a low risk of heart disease. In addition, the study's findings also demonstrated that there was no significant difference in risk of heart disease between men and women who consumed meat. The study was based on data from the United States' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The study's findings are significant because the results suggest that the general public may be overestimating the negative effects of red and processed meat. The researchers added, ""Our findings suggest that the public health message that red and processed meat intake increases the risk of heart disease may not be universally applicable to the general population."" According to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of 368,000 Americans each year.

Researchers have known for decades that the consumption of meat is linked to the risk of ill health. A 2010 study published in the journal Circulation calculated that eating two servings of red meat, processed meat, or poultry per week was associated with an increased risk of dying over a 20-year period. Red meat consumption was linked to 16 increase in the risk of death from cancer and a 21 increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. A 2013 study published in the British Journal of Cancer found that people eating about 76 grams of red and processed meat a day had a 20 increased risk of colorectal cancer compared to those who ate about 21 grams a day. A 2015 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism found that people who switched to a high-fat, high-protein diet for four days showed changes in their gut microbes, including a reduction in the diversity of microbes and an increase in the abundance of bacteria that are linked to obesity. A 2015 study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research found that red meat increased the levels of N-nitroso compounds in the human gut, which are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. A 2016 study published in the journal Microbiome found that the microbiomes of people eating a diet high in red meat differed significantly from those eating a diet high in grains, producing metabolites associated with heart disease, inflammation, and cancer. A 2017 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that each 100 gram increase in red meat consumption was associated with a 14 increase in cardiovascular disease risk and an 18 increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. A 2017 study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research found that red meat, in particular beef, increased the levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the blood. The study found that people eating a diet rich in red meat had triple the blood levels of TMAO compared to people eating a diet rich in either white meat or mostly plant-based foods. TMAO is a metabolite produced in the gut from nutrients found in red meat. TMAO is associated with increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and early death. A 2018 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism found that a diet high in red meat changed the microbial composition of the gut to one associated with increased heart disease. A 2018 study published in the journal Molecular Metabolism found that long-term consumption of a diet high in red meat triggered a biological process that caused the intestines to become leaky, allowing the bacteria in the gut to enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammation. A 2019 study published in the journal Nature found that a diet rich in red meat can trigger a pathway associated with cancer. The study found that a diet rich in red meat can turn up a chemical pathway in the body that is linked to the development of inflammation and cancer. A 2019 study published in the journal Gut found that a diet high in red meat led to an increase in the levels of TMAO in the gut. A 2019 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism found that a long-term diet high in red meat can increase the risk of heart disease by triggering chronic inflammation. The study found that a diet high in red meat led to a gut microbiome that produced trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) which triggered chronic inflammation and caused heart disease. The study found that gut bacteria produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) when digesting nutrients from red meat. TMAO causes chronic inflammation in the arteries, which leads to heart disease.

Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is a promising technology for tissue engineering, as it can create complex structures with high resolution and accuracy. However, this technique has been limited by its inability to print thick tissues. To address this issue, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, developed a new method for 3D bioprinting that uses a light-activated polymer to create a scaffold for cells to grow on. This scaffold is then infiltrated with bio-ink, which is a mixture of cells and hydrogel. The researchers successfully printed a human ear-like structure under the skin of mice, and the structure was able to support the growth of cartilage and blood vessels. This study represents a significant advance in the field of 3D bioprinting, and could lead to new treatments for a variety of diseases."

Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that allows for the precise and controlled placement of biological materials layer by layer. Bio-ink, which usually consists of living cells and a support matrix, can be printed in complex shapes and structures that can eventually develop into functional tissues and organs. In the case of the mouse ear-like structure, the scientists used a bioprinter to create a mold of the ear shape, which was then filled with a hydrogel-based bio-ink containing cartilage cells. The mold and bio-ink were then exposed to light, which activated a chemical reaction that cross-linked the molecules in the bio-ink, making it solidify into a solid structure. The mold was removed, and the resulting structure was implanted under the skin of a mouse where it continued to grow and develop into a shape resembling a human ear. This technique has significant potential to revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine, allowing for the creation of replacement tissues and organs that can be tailored to the specific needs of individual patients. It also has the potential to reduce the need for invasive surgical procedures, offering a less painful and more effective treatment option for many medical conditions."

The technique uses 3D scans of the subject's ear, which are then used as a digital blueprint for the 3D printed ear. The researchers hope to create replacement tissues for patients, such as those who have suffered severe trauma to the body. They also hope to use 3D printed tissue to replace cancerous tissue. A high-resolution digital image of a human ear was used to create a 3D digital model. This model was then divided into a number of layers, which were used to guide a 3D printer in the production of the ear. Using a technique called bioprinting, the researchers were able to 3D print the ear structure using cells and special bio-ink that was made out of collagen, gelatin, and nutrients. The ear-like structure was then implanted under the skin of a mouse. The bioprinted ear structure was able to develop a system of blood vessels that were able to keep the ear alive, and the cells within the ear were also able to divide and grow as the ear continued to develop. While this new technique still has a long way to go, the researchers hope that it will someday be able to print large 3D structures, such as organs, inside of humans. They also hope to eventually use a patient's own cells to create the 3D structure, which would make rejection of the organ almost impossible."

LLAMA,tldr-186,"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with it, including the LAPD. Well, this morning, the LAPD announced that it's no longer using PredPol, and that it never really used it in the first place. The press conference was called to clear up confusion following a Wired article that claimed that the LAPD's use of PredPol had, in fact, led to an overall decrease in crime. The LAPD's senior lead officer for predictive policing, Sean Malinowski, did not dispute the Wired article's claim that PredPol had led to an overall decrease in crime. But he did dispute the implication that it was PredPol itself that had led to the decrease. ""Predictive policing is not a software program. It is not an algorithm,"" Malinowski said. ""Predictive policing is a philosophy, an idea."" Malinowski said that PredPol's algorithm did not, in fact, inform LAPD officers where to go or what to do on patrol. Instead, the algorithm merely told them where to focus their attention. The algorithm did not actually make any decisions about where officers should go, nor did it ever guide an officer to a specific location, he said. The purpose of the algorithm is to help officers focus their attention on specific areas that are likely to be crime hotspots. It's up to the officers to decide how to police those hotspots, Malinowski said. In fact, Malinowski said that a lot of the time, officers may not even use the software at all, if they're busy with other things. ""You don't have to use PredPol,"" Malinowski said. ""You don't have to use it if you don't want to."" PredPol, he said, was merely another tool in the toolbox. It's the latest in a series of setbacks for PredPol and other predictive policing technologies. Last month, the Santa Cruz Police Department in California announced that it was suspending its use of PredPol, following a scathing report by the ACLU. The ACLU had found that the predictive policing software was disproportionately targeting low-income, minority communities for police patrols. Similarly, a recent ProPublica investigation also found that the predictive policing software used by the Chicago PD disproportionately targeted black communities. The ACLU is also currently fighting a lawsuit against the New York Police Department, challenging the constitutionality of its predictive policing program."
Tsinghua,tldr-186,"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with PredPol, using it to create maps showing which areas of a city are at risk of a crime outbreak. Predicting crime, even if the numbers are wrong, could help police figure out where they need to put more resources. But a 2012 study of PredPol's predictions by the University of Pennsylvania found that, despite its claims, the software is terrible at predicting crime. And even worse, the software can create false positives and negatively impact an area. Police departments are already using PredPol in Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, New York, and other cities, but the software is also being used by private companies like Gnip and Reveal, which sell it to police departments. Police departments don't know that their officers are using the software, so they're relying on its predictions without being aware of the potential consequences. Predicting crime isn't a perfect science, and there's no way to guarantee that a system that's designed to predict it will always be right. But if police departments are using PredPol to decide where to deploy resources, and they're using that software in a way that creates false positives, it could have a real impact on communities of color. There are ways that police departments can mitigate the problem, though. The use of PredPol by police departments in Baltimore, Cleveland, and New York is prohibited. In New York, the NYPD has said that they will only use PredPol to try to predict crime, and not to decide where to deploy resources. If you want to see what a police department might do if they use PredPol to decide where to deploy resources, check out the YouTube channel Cops and Robbers."

While the idea of using computers to identify potential crime hot-spots may be appealing, the data is based on past crime events - this may mean that if police departments rely on such technology, other areas may be overlooked.

Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with it, but the software has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates who say it could lead to racial profiling. PredPol uses historical crime data to create a model that predicts where crimes are likely to occur in the future. The model is based on factors such as the time of day, the day of the week, and the location of the crime. Police departments can then use the model to deploy officers to areas where crime is likely to occur. Critics of PredPol say that the software could lead to racial profiling because it is based on historical crime data, which is often skewed against minority communities. They argue that the software could be used to target minority communities for surveillance and harassment. Police departments that use PredPol say that the software is a valuable tool that helps them to allocate resources and prevent crime. They argue that the software is not biased against minority communities and that it has been effective in reducing crime rates. The debate over PredPol is likely to continue as more police departments begin to use the software. The software raises important questions about the use of predictive policing and the potential for bias in law enforcement."
BigScience,tldr-186,"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with this system, and some municipalities are planning to deploy it. The idea behind PredPol is simple: A camera equipped on foot patrols would capture photos from multiple angles every few seconds or so. The images can then be analyzed by algorithms which assess factors like crowd density, building size and proximity to other buildings, as well as lighting conditions and weather patterns (e.g., if it's rainy). Based on these data points, the computer will automatically generate predictions about potential criminal activity, such as drug dealing, robbery, assault and theft. However, while there's no shortage of promising research papers describing how machine learning could revolutionize policing, the reality may be less glamorous than the researchers imagine."

While some police departments have reported success with PredPol in reducing crime rates, others have raised concerns about the potential for the software to perpetuate bias and lead to over-policing of certain communities. Critics argue that the algorithm reinforces the targeting of certain neighborhoods based on past crime data, which may not accurately reflect current conditions or individual behavior. Additionally, there have been concerns raised about the transparency of the algorithm and the potential for errors or bias in the data that it uses. Overall, the use of PredPol remains controversial, and many experts agree that it should be used in conjunction with other methods of community policing and crime prevention."

BigScience,tldr-187,"React Hook Form makes it super easy to integrate and create forms that are fast performing and compact. A live demo is available. There is also a form builder to help you quickly build your own custom fields. Think of React Hooks as the building blocks for complex apps, but they can be combined in different ways depending on how much work needs to get done. As we mentioned earlier, React hooks have performance benefits over traditional single functions or callbacks. This article will cover some handy techniques for making use of this feature within our app. A functional component doesn't need to know about other components until it's mounted into an app flow graph. That's because all data accesses happen at mount-time, not runtime like with more traditional frameworks such as angular.js. fetch some user information from the database this.props.user await UserService.getUser (req); The above code goes through a web request to retrieve the users details. The promise resolves when data has been retrieved successfully from the server. (Alternatively, if there was any error while fetching the info, then ErrorHandler Component would handle the situation.) Another common technique used by developers who want to avoid websockets communication is to write their codes using redux-thunk (a sort-of middleware). It's useful for handling asynchronous requests inside application flows without having to worry about state management. Redux-Thunk allows us to dispatch actions, which trigger network operations based off store states. This means avoiding blocking main thread altogether during runtime. For instance, consider: import { connect } from'react-redux'; connect (null, mapStateToProps,) (App) export default App; no action creator needed here! In order to make sure nothing gets blocked forever whilst waiting for the result, we simply pass null as the second argument in mapStateToProps function. That way, every time someone visits 'users' route, react router creates a new render method, passing along its props object. We'll discuss Redux hubs next. If you're familiar with TypeScript, you might've noticed these two snippets look very similar. They both do exactly what they're supposed to: declare variables whose values change dynamically according to the current user id in this case. However... in practice, type definitions should never contain unnecessary logic except for compile-time semantic checks so it's best to keep things simple. One great benefit of TSLint is being able to suggest lints even before running the actual compilation phase! What Linter does TSLint analyzes typescript files and marks them up accordingly. It helps with improving maintainability by providing quick feedback regarding potential violations. Based on your project structure, TSLint supports writing rules for.tsx,.dsl,.less,.css,.handlebars template files, etc. It works well with modern IDEs including VS Code, Sublime Text 3 etc., so hopefully, it won't pose too many issues!"

A mining setup requires a building, hundreds of high-speed computer servers, a heavy-duty cooling system, and a location that can handle a lot of heat. That is a lot of power, and a lot of electricity. It can easily cost more than a few thousand dollars to build a mining setup. The good news is that you don't need a ton of money to get started with mining. There are some companies that provide hosting for mining, so you can have a place to run your mining setup. This is great if you don't have the money to buy a full setup. Also, if you want to sell your mining equipment, you can use these services to store and sell your equipment. For example, you can store your equipment at the Genesis Mining service, and then sell it when you are ready. Genesis Mining also provides power, and can help you with any other services that you might need. The bad news is that you might not get the return that you want on your investment. Some companies that provide hosting services for mining don't give a full refund for equipment that is returned. This is because the company has already paid for the equipment, and they don't want to lose money. In this situation, you can still do your own mining. If you are a miner, you might be able to sell your equipment to other miners, and use the proceeds to buy more equipment. 2.

LLAMA,tldr-188,"Bitcoin mining uses a huge amount of electricity. A mining setup requires a building, hundreds of high-speed computer servers, a heavy-duty cooling system, and a location that can handle a ton of electricity. All of this costs money and takes time to set up, so Bitcoin mining is a serious business. There are several other cryptocurrencies that are worth mining. Litecoin and Ethereum are two of the more popular options. In 2018, Bitcoin mining will use more electricity than all of Argentina, according to Digiconomist. Even if Bitcoin prices drop, the demand for mining is high enough to keep miners competitive. It is important to note that miners don't have to purchase the actual computers used for mining. They can opt to use a Bitcoin cloud mining service and simply pay for the computing power that they use. This is more cost effective and doesn't require any upfront hardware costs. To learn more about mining, check out this guide. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process. Mining rigs require a large amount of electricity. According to Digiconomist's Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, the estimated annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin is 67.83 TWh. To put that in perspective, the entire country of Argentina used 63.28 TWh of electricity in 2016. This is an important topic because electricity costs money and mining Bitcoin is designed to be profitable. The problem is that the price of Bitcoin is volatile. It can change rapidly, which makes it difficult to predict whether mining will be profitable. In a bull market, the increase in Bitcoin price can offset the rise in mining difficulty. In a bear market, the decline in price can make mining unprofitable. If the price of Bitcoin declines, the mining difficulty will adjust itself to ensure that the block time remains at 10 minutes. This means that if the price of Bitcoin drops 50, miners will stop mining until the difficulty is adjusted to reflect the new price. Bitcoin's price is expected to continue to rise, which means mining will become more profitable. Bitcoin mining is expected to become more energy intensive because the difficulty will increase with the price. According to Crescent Electric Supply Company, the national average cost of a kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the United States is 0.129. This means that one Bitcoin costs 4,758.40 to mine at current prices. This is based on the average energy consumption of 45.30 kWh, which is derived from Difficulty and Network Hash Rate. The cost of electricity is cheaper in certain countries. For example, it is cheaper to mine in Venezuela. According to El Universal, electricity will cost residents dollars per kWh. At this rate, it only costs 0.26 to mine one Bitcoin in Venezuela. Since mining is an energy intensive process, many miners have moved to countries with cheap electricity. This is also known as ""electricity arbitrage."" Iceland has become a popular destination for miners because approximately 100 of the country's energy is produced by renewable sources, which makes it very environmentally friendly. Miners are also moving to Canada because of the country's cheap energy. Quebec and Manitoba are currently home to several Bitcoin mining operations. Quebec's energy is so cheap that a proposal has been made to give citizens free heating in exchange for mining Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is an expensive process, but if you have access to cheap electricity, it is worth it. You can use a Bitcoin mining calculator to determine the profitability of mining Bitcoin in your area.

BigScience,tldr-189,"YouTube and Amazon have finally ended their feud after a year of negotiations. The YouTube app will now return to Amazon's Fire TV products, and the Amazon Prime Video app can be found on all devices with Android or iOS. This is the first time that an app has seen its presence amended for such great lengths over so long - some sources believe it could take years before Google returns again to this field. Both apps are currently not available in any regions outside Europe and North America; furthermore, only specific device models from each vendor support them. The battle between these two giants began back in 2013 when they launched dedicated streaming services for online video downloads, which were later moved into separate mobile apps by both sides. However, as soon as those programs became popular among consumers they quickly turned many people away because users had to download individual videos instead of watching online. Now, with the removal of Vudu, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, CBS All Access (now Paramount), Showtime GO, Sky News 247, BBC iPlayer and more from major retailers like Walmart and Best Buy along with Apple's decision to drop the Tidal music service last week, it seems we're heading towards a much better future where all services are aggregated under one roof.

Tsinghua,tldr-192,"Jerdon's jumping worker ants can become reproductive queens when their queens die. The transition comes with changes to the ant's brain, gene expression, hormone levels, and cell composition. Researchers have previously discovered that a type of neuron in the brain of a queen ant can produce hormones that activate queen genes, allowing the queen to begin her reproductive cycle. In this study, scientists analyzed the brain of the queen ant, the queen's descendants, and the queen's ""stepchildren"" to learn more about the evolutionary changes that occurred after the queen's death. The researchers discovered that the queen's descendants and stepchildren had lower numbers of the queen-making neurons in their brains. This means that the brain changes that make queens can be passed on to the next generation, allowing the colony to continue producing queens after a queen dies. ""This study suggests that queen inheritance occurs through the brain, and not through some other, as yet unknown mechanism,"" said Dr. Adam Baker, co-author of the study and a neurobiologist at the University of Bristol. ""It is clear that these brain changes are part of the molecular mechanisms that determine whether an individual becomes a queen or a worker."" The researchers also found that the queen's descendants and stepchildren have lower numbers of a hormone called octopamine, which is produced by a type of neuron that helps control how the queen ant responds to mating signals. The hormone plays a role in octopamine-mediated learning and memory. The researchers found that the queens had the highest number of octopamine-producing neurons, which suggests that the queens have the highest memory for mating. ""We think that the queen's descendants and stepchildren have a memory deficit,"" said Baker. ""This deficit in memory could be the result of a decrease in the number of octopamine neurons in the brain. Reduced octopamine production could cause the queen's descendants and stepchildren to lose their memories of mating."" The study, ""Neurogenetic inheritance of queen-making ability in a trophically controlled ant,"" was published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology."
LLAMA,tldr-192,"Jerdon's jumping worker ants can become reproductive queens when their queens die. The transition comes with changes to the ant's brain, gene expression, hormone levels, and cell composition. Researchers have found that a protein, SfSPH, is involved in those changes. Credit: Tatyana Livshyts Ants are social insects that typically live in nests of a single breed, or ""caste,"" which consists of wingless females who are workers that forage for food and care for the young. But in some species, worker ants can develop wings and take on the role of a reproductive female when their queen dies. The switch from worker to queen is accompanied by a shift in the way the ant's brain is wired, changes in its gene expression, and hormone levels, and a change in the composition of the cells that make up the brain. A team of scientists led by Rockefeller University's Daniel Kronauer is studying these changes. In a new paper published in PLOS Biology, they report that a single protein, SfSPH, is involved in both the dramatic shift in brain function as well as the shift in brain composition. The discovery came when the researchers set out to uncover the function of a protein called SfSPH, which they found was produced in the brains of young workers and queens, but not in the brains of older workers. ""This protein is a member of a family of proteins that are involved in embryonic development,"" Kronauer says. ""In flies and worms, other members of the SPH family of proteins control cell division and morphology during development. But we didn't see any changes in the cell number or shape of the ant brain after the ants transitioned to queens. We wondered what was going on."" To investigate, the researchers turned to a technique that Kronauer's lab has used in the past to study the connections between ants' brains and behavior. In this case, they used a toxin to remove the SfSPH protein from the brains of workers who were in the process of becoming queens. The toxin only affected a single type of cell in the ant's brain. ""We found that the ants treated with the toxin did not go on to become queens,"" says Kronauer. ""They became workers, and only workers."" Ants that received the toxin treatment maintained the brain composition and connections of a worker, suggesting that SfSPH plays an essential role in the dramatic changes that take place in a worker ant's brain when it becomes a queen. The researchers also found that SfSPH is involved in regulating a reproductive hormone. When they treated the transitioning workers with the toxin, the levels of the hormone - called Duf - dropped. Without SfSPH, the workers never made the transition to queen. ""This is an important first step toward understanding how neural plasticity is involved in controlling behavior,"" says Kronauer.

In December 2018 the Norwegian Coastal Administration's multipurpose vessel, RV Gunnerus, also completed a sea trial in the Trondheim fjord. A major milestone in the development of autonomous ship technology is now being achieved by the Finnish firm Wartsila. It has announced that it is to test a ferry with autonomous navigation in the waters of Finland. The tests are to be carried out in the first half of 2019, and will use the 83-metre long ferry Falco, owned by Finferries. The vessel operates on a route between the Finnish mainland and the island of Korppoo. The 1,500-tonne ship will be fitted with a Wartsila Nacos Platinum Joystick system, which will control the ship's navigation. The system incorporates dynamic positioning and route optimisation, and has a track control system that can compensate for external factors that affect a ship's progress, such as waves, wind and currents. Wartsila has made it clear that the Falco is not to be an unmanned vessel. The system will be operated and monitored onboard the ship, with no remote control. The main objective of the tests is to develop autonomous navigation and positioning capabilities. ""It is important to note that vessels like Falco operate in an intensely congested sea area where there is an especially high volume of ferry traffic and cargo transports,"" said Wartsila's Jonne Jokela. ""Developing this technology can have a considerable impact in terms of safety and efficiency,"" he added. The pace of development of autonomous ship technology is such that Rolls-Royce has now established its own autonomous vessel operations centre in Turku, Finland, which has the responsibility for developing the technology. The control centre is equipped with sophisticated software that enables it to operate several ships at the same time from a distance of hundreds of miles. ""We want to take a leading role in developing fully autonomous ships. This is the most important development project for us today,"" said Rolls-Royce's Esko Mustamaki. ""We will use the centre to develop our technology and to find out what regulations are needed for autonomous ships. This is an excellent example of a partnership between industry and academia, and we hope to learn a great deal from the feedback provided by our partners in Turku,"" he added. Meanwhile, the US Coast Guard is stepping up its efforts to develop regulations for autonomous ships. It has published the first draft of a document that is intended to provide guidance to owners and operators of autonomous ships. It is called Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-18, and is described as a first step towards addressing the use of emerging technologies in the maritime industry. The NVIC states that autonomous systems have the potential to enhance maritime safety, and can provide a means to reduce workload onboard, improve vessel performance and efficiency, and decrease the likelihood of human error. ""To properly and fully address autonomous technology in the marine environment, the Coast Guard is pursuing a 'think big, start small and scale fast' strategy,"" said the Coast Guard's Jeff Lantz. It is not just Rolls-Royce and Wartsila that are developing autonomous ship technology. Last year we reported on how an autonomous containership had been operated by Japan's MOL in a demonstration in Tokyo Bay."

That said; there are tons of free and paid premium themes out there ready to go so you don't have to spend time learning how they work! The main disadvantage to this approach is probably data leaking between wordpress installations. Especially when sharing hosting accounts it's very important check what plugins are enabled before installing them again else someone could hijack the database! It shouldn't matter if you decide not to purchase a pre-made theme since the foundation for every theme exists offsite inside the public repository. So just download whatever you want and start modifying it right away: This takes no coding knowledge whatsoever -the only thing you need are some basic HTMLCSS3 knowledge along with a little bit of handcrafting skills...

LLAMA,tldr-197,"Every machine learning model is based on linear algebra. This document contains introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning. The notes are meant to be used as a quick reference for the most frequently used linear algebra concepts. Note that this document is not meant to be comprehensive, and is just a brief overview of the relevant topics. Given a vector x, the operation xT (x transpose) produces a column vector with the elements of the vector x in reverse order. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is a scalar quantity that is equal to the sum of the product of the corresponding elements of x and y. Given two vectors x and y, the vector cross product x y is a vector perpendicular to both x and y with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors x and y. A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers, called scalars in this context. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. A vector space is called finite dimensional if the set of vectors has a finite number of elements. The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space, i.e., the number of coordinates required to specify any vector. Vectors can be added together. For every vector u and scalar c, the vector cu is also in the vector space. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u v) cu cv. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u - v) cu - cv. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u v w) cu cv cw. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u - v - w) cu - cv - cw. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) u cu du. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) v cv dv. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) w cw dw. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) u v w cu v w dv w. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) u - v - w cu - v - w dv - v - w. A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers, called scalars in this context. A vector space is called finite-dimensional if the set of vectors has a finite number of elements. An inner product is a type of product in vector algebra. The inner product of two vectors in a vector space is a real number (usually) obtained by multiplying the two vectors component-wise, and adding the products. If the vectors are x (x1, x2, ..., xn) and y (y1, y2, ..., yn), then their inner product is x1y1 x2y2 ... xnyn. A vector space together with an inner product is called an inner product space. An inner product space is a vector space equipped with an additional structure called an inner product. The standard inner product on n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the dot product. The dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of two n-dimensional real vectors. The length of a vector is the distance from the origin to the tip of the vector. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is the length of the projection of y onto x. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is equal to the product of the magnitudes of x and y and the cosine of the angle between them. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is equal to the length of y times the length of x times the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of the angle between two vectors x and y is equal to the dot product of x and y divided by the length of x times the length of y. The cosine of the angle between two vectors x and y is equal to the dot product of x and y divided by the length of the"

The notes are meant to be used as a starting point or reference in preparing course material, but do not involve any prerequisites beyond basic knowledge of mathematics. The objective of this note is two-fold: First, it explains the basics and rationale behind certain linear algebra concepts that have recently been found useful when applying advanced machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks (DNNs); secondly, it describes fundamental mathematical results about matrices needed in traditional numerical analysis settings which can often be directly translated into computational algorithms using modern software packages to speed up implementation of these models. While some aspects of computing theory had already emerged during the development of ML, much has changed since the original days of statistics. Machine Learning consists now rather than just statistical inference, with its own algorithmic framework providing an alternative approach from exact interpretation. Interesting applications include computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics and economics. As always happens, there's nothing more compelling than new challenges! In particular, AI research requires new ideas and skills to progress towards real-world application scenarios. And today we will see why this is true."

Tsinghua,tldr-197,"Every machine learning model is based on linear algebra. This document contains introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning. The notes are meant to be used as a starting point for learning linear algebra, rather than as an in-depth study of linear algebra. The notes are primarily written in terms of linear regression, but can be easily applied to other machine learning models as well. For a more detailed review of linear algebra, see Linear Algebra Done Right by Andrew Kolluri and Linear Algebra in Computer Vision by Dan Challen. Preliminaries Linear algebra is based on the linear space of real numbers. The dimension of the space is called the dimension of the linear space. A linear transformation is a mapping from one linear space to another. A vector is a point in a linear space. A matrix is a matrix of numbers, where each row of the matrix is a vector. A matrix is called a square matrix if each row of the matrix has the same number of elements. A matrix is called symmetric if each row of the matrix is the same as the corresponding column. A matrix is called Hermitian if the sum of each row is equal to the sum of the corresponding column. A matrix is called a diagonal matrix if each row and column contains only one number. Symmetric and Hermitian matrices can be used to build other matrices, and diagonal matrices can be used to build other diagonal matrices. Matrix decompositions LU decomposition Given an m-by-n matrix A, we can find the LU decomposition of A as follows: L is an m-by-m upper triangular matrix with diagonal elements equal to 1. U is an n-by-n upper triangular matrix with diagonal elements equal to 1. A is the product of L and U. This is called the LU decomposition. Singular value decomposition Given an m-by-n matrix A, we can find the SVD of A as follows: U is an m-by-m orthogonal matrix, such that each column of U is an orthonormal basis for the column space of A. V is an n-by-n orthogonal matrix, such that each column of V is an orthonormal basis for the row space of A. S is an n-by-n diagonal matrix, such that the diagonal elements of S are the singular values of A. The columns of U and V are orthonormal, and the columns of S are the singular values of A. The singular values of A are sorted in descending order, such that the largest singular value is the first singular value, and the smallest singular value is the last singular value. This is called the SVD of A. Singular values can be interpreted as the squares of the distances between the data points in the column space of A and the data points in the row space of A. The singular values of A are sorted in descending order, such that the largest singular value is the first singular value, and the smallest singular value is the last singular value. This is called the SVD of A. QR decomposition Given an m-by-n matrix A, we can find the QR decomposition of A as follows: Q is an m-by-m orthogonal matrix, such that each column of Q is an orthonormal basis for the column space of A. R is an n-by-n upper triangular matrix with diagonal elements equal to 1. A is the product of Q and R. This is called the QR decomposition. Eigenvalue decomposition Given an m-by-n matrix A, we can find the eigenvalue decomposition of A as follows: E is an n-by-n diagonal matrix, such that the diagonal elements of E are the eigenvalues of A. A is the product of E and a diagonal matrix D, where D contains the eigenvectors of A. This is called the eigenvalue decomposition. The eigenvalues of A are sorted in ascending order, such that the first eigenvalue is the largest eigenvalue, and the last eigenvalue is the smallest eigenvalue. This is called the eigenvalue decomposition. Eigenvector decomposition Given an m-by-n matrix A, we can find the eigenvector decomposition of A as follows: E is an n-by-n diagonal matrix, such that the diagonal elements of E are the eigenvalues of A. A is the product of E and a diagonal matrix D, where D contains the eigenvectors of A. This is called the eigenvalue decomposition. The eigenvectors of A are sorted in ascending order, such that the first eigenvector is the largest eigenvector, and the last eigenvector is the smallest eigenvector. This is called the eigenvector decomposition. SVD decomposition The SVD decomposition of a matrix A is given by: U is an m-by-m orthogonal matrix, such that each column of U is an orthonormal basis for the column space of A. V is an n-by-n orthogonal matrix, such that each column of V is an orthonormal basis for the row space of A. S is an n-by-n diagonal matrix, such that the diagonal elements of S are the singular values of A."

LLAMA,tldr-198,"The Apple Store went down for just over an hour on Tuesday and came back with a brand-new look. The new design is filled with cards, similar to Apple's Store app for iOS, and is more about helping you buy a product, rather than just shopping for one. The site now features a card-based design similar to Apple's iOS and tvOS apps, including Apple Pay support for purchasing items directly from the site, along with the addition of a new account preference allowing for site-wide dark mode to match the dark mode option in macOS Mojave. The redesign includes a ""Shop Now"" button on the top right, which takes you to the site's full catalog. In the left-hand navigation bar, the old ""iPhone"" option has been replaced with ""Apple,"" which will take you to all of the company's devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod, and more. The left-hand navigation bar also includes categories for Services, Apple Store, Support, and Apple Newsroom, while the right-hand side has options to log in to your account, check your order status, chat with a Specialist, set up an appointment at an Apple Store, or find your local Apple Store. On the homepage, Apple highlights its latest and greatest products with larger images and fewer words, a major change from the previous design that featured many products with smaller images and a lot of text. The website is also full of touches from Apple's ""beyond the page"" design language, including curved page corners, drop shadows, and more. In the navigation bar for individual product pages, there's now a ""More Details"" option that can be toggled to show more specs about the product, and Apple has added a new ""Compare"" feature to make it easier to see the differences between products. The new Compare feature is also available on iOS in the Apple Store app. The site's checkout process now supports Apple Pay, allowing you to complete a purchase with Touch ID on the iPhone or Mac, or Face ID on the iPhone X. Apple Pay can be used in the browser to complete purchases on the new Apple Store, even when using an iPad or Mac without Touch ID. The redesigned Apple Store website was first noticed by users in early October. Apple is in the process of revamping its online store experience to better highlight products. These new store pages are built on a completely new platform that Apple is calling ""WebKit2,"" which will be replacing the company's old e-commerce platform, ""Yosemite."" For Apple, this means that the online store will be updated more frequently with new content, and new products will be easier to launch. Apple's website is designed in a way that allows the company to launch new products, pages, and even site designs, without having to go through the App Store review process like third-party developers. Update 1023: Apple has also introduced a new ""Dark Mode"" option in the footer of its website. When enabled, the Apple Store's website design and content will have a dark tint to it, matching the new ""Dark Mode"" option in macOS Mojave. The new option is available to Apple's website users in macOS Mojave. I hope they bring back the product configurator for iPhones. It's a real shame they took that away. I feel like this website is getting more and more dumbed down for the masses. They've had the product configurator for iPhones in the iOS app for a while now. I think they should put a toggle in the mobile site for light and dark mode. I'm confused, I thought this was a MacRumors article and not an Apple press release? They have no need for that, iPhones can be configured on the store app. I really hate the product pages. They just show a few images with a lot of blank space. And they don't even have the basic details like a full list of included accessories."

BigScience,tldr-199,"btrace is an Android trace tool based on Systrace. It supports custom and native events, and it can be set to only capture trace events of the main thread. btrace has a range over other trace tools because: (1) it uses an unoptimized code for tracing. (2) It writes statically typed traces that enables efficient reverse engineering done by many platforms. We use the following approach: first we instrument the tested app with our own apktool; then we inject some specific commands into its execution path 32; lastly, we run our tests without the injected logs. The experiment setup follows Table 1. We test two apps using three different OSs while setting up five Linux distributions as well as four Windows operating systems 33. In order to generate synthetic log files, we create a file containing all the possible event sequences in each examined system. Each sequence contains at least one downtime count and time stamp. The starting point of every generated sequence corresponds either to the application start or user activity click. For instance, if we want to analyse AOL's web browser under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Chrome 77, we would need to build such logs as: where m i represents the current monitor state value during clock cycle i. In this example, the j-th element indicates which command was executed between t Now -T d n1 and t Now T s delay i, where T c i 1000 msec, t Now stands for the current timestamp and T S denotes service period duration. Given the number N of monitored objects and the total number M of clock cycles required to execute the program, we have 2N M possible configurations. Hence, there are (2M) k solutions when considering each input parameter combination. Results This section describes the results obtained after applying the proposed framework to select appropriate monitoring parameters towards maximizing detection accuracy. Specifically, Section 5.1 focuses on evaluating the impact of increasing the observation window size introduced in Section 4.4 against varying systrace logging frequency from 50 Hz to 200 Hz. Next, Section 5.3 discusses how these observations affect possibly selected monitoring metric values as defined in Section 3. Finally, Section 5.4 presents comparative analysis across various combinations of targeted metrics. Impact of Monitoring Window Size Settings Description To evaluate the impact of observing more than just a single step within each observed interval (as described in Section 4.4), we ran experiments employing Performance Evaluation Results As shown in Fig. 7, increasing the observation window size increases average precision but also causes significant increase in both false positive rate and recall rates. For this reason, we choose W 0 (the default value used so far). Comparison With Related Works Our approaches outperform techniques presented in [7] [8] [9] [10] 31] mainly because they aim at detecting rare patterns instead of simple pattern occurrences but not their exact durations. Moreover, they do not require any additional effort related to changing previously deployed monitoring infrastructure. Related Work 6.5.1 Detection Techniques for DDoS Attacks Several research efforts target network intrusion detection and anomaly-based attack detection focusing on DDoS attacks. Most of the existing work relies on TCP packet inspection methods [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] 39] mainly utilizing flow statistics collected over long periods of time. Although useful, these approaches cannot detect very short-time-long-duration (STLD) attacks. To overcome this limitation, researchers propose several low-runtime anomaly detection algorithms working directly on traffic data captured at switches [20] [21] [22] 23, 24, 27, 29, 30, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41 ] primarily exploiting variations in inter-arrival times and inter-sentence timescales recorded via tcpdump subcommand. However, none of them successfully detects STLD DDoS due to inaccurate modeling of classical TCP flows as presented further in Section 8.6. Moreover, all prior works mentioned above suffer from high false positives meaning that most detection alerts are likely misclassifications rather than true anomalous behaviors. Detection Algorithms Based on Dynamic Time Warping A few recent studies focus specifically on developing dynamic time warping (DTW) -like distance measures capable of capturing differences among complex datasets exhibiting abrupt changes [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] and spiky behavior 36. Despite promising initial findings, DTW models still lack robustness with respect to changes occurring in the monitored server's runtime environment 24. This drawback may cause frequent alarms even though no anomalies exist in reality thus wasting valuable resources. Attacker Modeling Approaches Based on attacker profiling information andor historical DDoS dataset analysis [49] [50] [51] [52], experts formulate sophisticated mathematical formulae aiming to predict future actions of potential adversaries. Afterwards, they utilize machine learning approaches like artificial neural networks 20, 21, 22, 53, 54 to learn to recognize regular patterns caused by normal users accessing legitimate websites. Such approaches achieve satisfactory performance if they rely solely on statistical features extracted from individual past cases. Unfortunately, since these methods assume that malicious activities follow certain consecutive patterns, they fail to adapt quickly once new threats occur. Monitor"

Android Debug Bridge The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a tool for debugging and interacting with Android applications. It is part of the Android SDK and is a part of the Android runtime. It has both a command-line interface and a graphical interface. ADB provides access to the debug bridge. ADB is a serial device, which means that you can only connect one device at a time to ADB. It is used for command-line interactions, but it can also be used for debugging applications. ADB can run in two modes: Local: This is when you run ADB from the command line and connect to an Android device. Remote: This is when you run ADB from the command line and connect to an Android emulator. The ADB Interface The ADB interface consists of three parts: Android Debug Bridge: This is the command-line tool that you use to connect to an Android device. ADB Interface: This is the graphical interface that you use to connect to an Android emulator. Android Debug Bridge Client: This is the client that communicates with the ADB interface. ADB can run in either local or remote mode. ADB Interface In the ADB interface, you connect to an Android emulator and run commands from the command line. The following diagram shows the connection between the ADB interface and the Android emulator. Figure 3-10 shows the connection between the ADB interface and the Android emulator. The ADB interface is available in the Android SDK. You can find the ADB interface in the following directory: AndroidSdkplatform-toolsadb Android Debug Bridge Client The Android Debug Bridge Client (ADB Client) is the program that communicates with the ADB interface. The following command shows the ADB Client program: adb The ADB Client is available in the Android SDK. You can find the ADB Client in the following directory: AndroidSdkplatform-toolsadb ADB Interface The ADB Interface is the graphical interface that you use to connect to an Android emulator. You can start the ADB Interface by running the following command: adb devices You should see a list of the devices connected to your computer. You can then use the graphical interface to connect to the Android emulator. Configuring the ADB Interface The ADB Interface is the graphical interface that you use to connect to an Android emulator. The ADB Interface can be configured to run in local or remote mode. The ADB Interface is available in the Android SDK. You can find the ADB Interface in the following directory: AndroidSdkplatform-toolsadb The ADB Interface uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to connect to an Android emulator. The ADB Interface supports remote mode. In remote mode, you connect to an Android emulator from your local computer. The ADB Interface uses the ADB Client to communicate with the ADB interface. Local Mode Local mode is the default mode. When you connect to an Android emulator in local mode, you connect to the Android emulator by name. For example, you can use the following command to connect to the default Android emulator: adb connect localhost:5555 The ADB Interface will display a message that it is connecting to the default Android emulator. The message will also display the IP address of the Android emulator. Remote Mode In remote mode, you connect to an Android emulator by IP address. For example, you can use the following command to connect to the default Android emulator: adb connect 192.168.1.2:5555 You can also use the IP address of the Android emulator instead of the name of the Android emulator. You can use the IP address of the Android emulator to connect to an Android emulator from a remote computer. ADB Client The ADB Client is the program that communicates with the ADB Interface. The ADB Client is available in the Android SDK. You can find the ADB Client in the following directory: AndroidSdkplatform-toolsadb The ADB Client can run in both local and remote mode.

OpenAI,tldr-201,"Researchers have created a smart textile that is flexible, breathable, durable, and functions as a display. It can be integrated with a fabric keyboard and power supply. The textile has the potential to revolutionize wearable technology by allowing for interactive displays on clothing or other textile products. The smart textile is made by embedding flexible, conductive materials into the fabric. These materials can be programmed to display graphics or text, and can even be used to control other devices through touch controls. The textile can be manufactured in a variety of colors and can be cut into different shapes and sizes to fit a wide range of clothing or accessory designs. One of the key benefits of this technology is its durability. The smart textile can withstand repeated bending and stretching without damaging the display, making it an ideal choice for wearable technology that needs to be flexible. Another advantage of the smart textile is its breathability. Unlike traditional screens, which can trap heat and moisture against the skin, the textile material allows for air to flow through, keeping the wearer comfortable. The integration of a fabric keyboard and power supply further expands the possibilities for this technology. Users could potentially control other devices or interact with their phone or computer through their clothing, freeing up their hands for other tasks. Overall, the smart textile has the potential to revolutionize the wearable technology industry by providing a flexible, durable, and customizable display that can be integrated into a wide range of clothing and accessory designs."

Pain expert Dr HTC Yau says there may soon be a way to deliver drugs directly into body tissues using light. It might seem surprising at first - but researchers say some common painkillers could actually stimulate nerves rather than relieve them when applied under specific conditions. A team led by Professor Nicholas Smith of the University of Edinburgh has now found two ways it works this way: 1) opening up electrically-fast gap junctions between nerve cells; 2) increasing levels of ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. Although these effects were known previously - they had never been linked together before - so it's exciting that our clever brain has figured out how to work both methods simultaneously: releasing the painkiller through one method while stimulating your spinal cord via another! In other words, if you apply too much of any kind of analgesia (pain relief), then your brain will know about it! And maybe even start expecting more...in the same area each time?

PaLM,tldr-203,"A team of Italian scientists has created a hydrogel that can remove paints from other paints of similar chemical composition. It can be used to repair street art that has been vandalized, or to remove graffiti from buildings. The hydrogel is made of a polymer that is able to absorb water, and it is also able to form a bond with the paint. When the hydrogel is applied to the paint, it begins to absorb water from the paint, which causes the paint to swell and become soft. The hydrogel then forms a bond with the paint, and when it is removed, it pulls the paint off of the surface. The hydrogel can be used to remove both water-based and oil-based paints, and it is non-toxic and biodegradable."

BigScience,tldr-203,"A team of Italian scientists has created a hydrogel that can remove paints from other paints of similar chemical composition. It can be used to repair street art that has been vandalised or damaged. The new technology is based on the idea of swelling and shrinking, which are common features in polymeric materials such as gelatine and gum arabic. The work published this week by Nature Chemistry shows how simple molecules may contain these properties that make them useful for industrial purposes. ""The thing about polymers is their flexibility: they have an enormous number of conformations,"" says Nicola Elia, professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, who led the study alongside his colleagues Luca Zanzotto and Francesco Cioli. ""But when you want something rigid, like building a molecular motor, then you need one conformation - for example the 'glass transition' where all chains rearrange themselves without moving faster than 10th power slower than the speed of light. "" Elia explains that biologists use small proteins called Gelsolin-like domains (GLDs) to create gels; GLD sequences perform mechanical tasks with ease because they fold into dense, yet flexible structures made up of bundles of coils. By using short synthetic peptides containing GLDs, researchers developed a superhydrophobic coating that could repel water droplets. ""We did not change anything, but just inserted three amino acids close together in our peptide sequence to give it the hydrophobicity we needed. If you insert such a trifold between two coiled-coil regions, the whole structure will become more rigid, while keeping its ability to bend around objects even after being stretched several times longer compared to what happens when there's only a single coil region,"" he highlights. Nicola Elia: ""Gum Arabic glues itself to your finger and stays stuck there until you wash off everything else ... it's very good for adhesion! A molecule with many (coils), therefore, would retain an increased level of rigidity. This allowed us to build a surface able to protect things against damage... From my point of view, you're painting over paint under protection! We also found out that if you put some oil onto it, it becomes sticky again and goes back to its original state, so for applications in the food industry we shouldn't worry too much about pollution issues either. In particular, we investigated whether it was possible to use it for making cell walls biomimetic and durable enough to keep cells intact during cultivation processes across large scales - e.g., for drying fruits and vegetables - the possibility of regulating germination rate through the nature of the applied inhibitor. Our results showed promising potential towards future organic agriculture technologies. Finally, once we had confirmed its excellent performance, we decided to test whether it could prevent graffiti from getting painted over again, possibly reducing vandalism... I think it would definitely help, although I'm sure I'd prefer having much thinner layers of paint to start with!"" Zanzotto adds: ""This method allows you to achieve exceptional properties, both antifouling and self-cleaning ones. With reference to the first property, the tested material prevents biofouling while allowing biological growth on top of it; however, unlike natural coatings, which form films only locally, here the system forms uniform layers across the entire object. On the other hand, according to studies carried out in collaboration with UCLA, the same approach makes the surfaces self-healing thanks to the presence of oxyethylene groups. These functionalities offer unprecedented opportunities for creating smart 3D architectures capable of adapting differentially to external stimuli. For instance, if properly engineered and controlled, upon contact with liquids of low pH the film changes shape due to osmotic pressure increase inside the network, thus facilitating cleaning, whereas once immersed in alkaline solutions the gel volume increases, effectively acting as a barrier preventing any further staining of the substrate."

However, if the incident lasted several days, it might require the IRT to bring in additional resources to investigate and respond to the incident. Timeliness is key for the IRT. Timely investigations and responses help to minimize the impact of the incident. A 24-hour incident is a lot more disruptive than a 48-hour incident.

According to detectives, Lopez was taken into custody near Lake Chapala Boulevard and Coors Avenue around 8:30 am by officers from El Cajon Police Department Senior LEO units. He reportedly shot at both an officer and another man when asked if there were any weapons inside her house. Lopez told investigators he didn't know why someone would want to shoot him because no one ever hit back before, according to reports. The suspect will appear in court next Monday where he faces charges including murderattempt-to-murder, possession of illegal firearmpistol, attempted armed robbery, making threats against persons under protection and false imprisonment.

However, recent studies have shown that it is possible to reliably detect if an image is fake by using a simple classifier.

LLAMA,tldr-207,"StyleGAN2 is a style-based GAN architecture for data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. It improves on image quality, and it also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is real or generated. StyleGAN2 is a powerful, large-scale generative model of images. To make it possible to produce high quality samples, it has a large latent space that contains the relevant image variation information. Unlike StyleGAN1, which produced images of a single style, StyleGAN2 generates samples from a normal distribution over the latent space, which lets it produce images with multiple styles. The StyleGAN2 architecture can be divided into three parts: the generator, the discriminator, and the style encoder. The generator is a mapping network that maps the latent code Z to a generated image. The style encoder is a mapping network that maps the generated image to a style code. The discriminator maps the real and generated images to the probability that they are real. Each component has a few different architectural modifications to improve the quality of the generated samples. The generator uses a single mapping network to generate the image. The mapping network uses a multi-scale architecture to handle the image variation across different spatial scales. The generator and discriminator both use a windowed discrimination mechanism to reduce the computational cost. Each image is processed in non-overlapping windows, and the discriminator is only allowed to use information from the current window. The discriminator has a novel multi-scale architecture that uses a set of progressively smaller networks. The smaller networks make it possible to compute deeper architectures, which improves the discriminator's performance. The discriminator uses a novel sub-pixel discrimination mechanism that can use information from sub-pixel regions of the image. The sub-pixel discrimination mechanism lets the discriminator use information from small objects and thin structures in the image. The generator uses a style encoder to extract style information from the generated image. The style encoder is then used to compute an objective function that can be used to train the generator using the style encoder loss. The style encoder loss allows the StyleGAN2 architecture to produce high quality samples with a relatively small dataset. The style encoder loss also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is real or generated. StyleGAN2 uses a set of small networks to perform the sub-pixel discrimination. Each small network uses a set of kernels that are repeated in a grid pattern to allow it to extract information from sub-pixel regions of the image. The style encoder loss is a style-based loss that is used to train the generator. It is based on the latent code, Z, and the style code, C. The style code is the output of the style encoder that maps the image to a style code. The style code is used as an input to the generator. This means that the generator can produce images of different styles. The style encoder loss is used to compute an objective function that can be minimized using gradient descent. The generator architecture is a mapping network that maps a latent code Z to a generated image. The mapping network uses a multi-scale architecture to handle image variation across different spatial scales. Each network in the multi-scale architecture uses a progressive upsampling mechanism. This mechanism is used to upsample the input image to the desired size. The image is upsampled by a factor of two with a set of upsampled convolutions. Each upsampled convolution is followed by a regular convolution. The windowed discrimination mechanism divides the image into non-overlapping windows, and only allows the discriminator to use information from the current window. This reduces the computational cost, and it makes it possible to use a deeper architecture. The discriminator architecture is a multi-scale architecture that uses a set of progressively smaller networks to extract image variation information across different spatial scales. Each network in the multi-scale architecture uses a progressive downsampling mechanism to downsample the input image. The image is downsampled by a factor of two with a set of downsampled convolutions. Each downsampled convolution is followed by a regular convolution. The sub-pixel discrimination mechanism uses a set of small networks to extract information from sub-pixel regions of the image. Each small network is constructed using a set of kernels that are repeated in a grid pattern. The kernels are repeated in a grid pattern because the image is downsampled by a factor of two between each network in the multi-scale architecture. The number of times the kernels are repeated is equal to the number of times the image is downsampled. The size of"

Players can also spend their money to purchase premium in-game assets, but the best way to build a profit is to sell builds. As with most games, it is difficult to make a profit in Axie Infinity. However, if you are willing to put in the time, you can earn a few bucks. Here are a few ways to make money playing Axie Infinity: 1. Selling builds Axie Infinity is very different from other games in that you cannot just buy a finished build and sell it for a profit. You need to work on your build and then build it. Once you are finished, you can sell it for a profit. Building a build is a slow process. You need to go through the process of creating your own item and then you need to be creative enough to find a unique selling point. Once you have created a good build, it is a good idea to post it in the marketplace for players to see. There are several places where you can post your builds. The most popular place is on Axie Wall, where you can find players who are looking for builds. There are also some premium marketplaces that allow you to sell your builds to other players. The one that is the most popular is called MyShop. You can get a free account by registering on MyShop. The downside of selling builds on MyShop is that you are limited to 15 builds. However, you can get a 15-build account by paying 15 USD for a one-month premium membership. 2. Building Extensions Building Extensions is a new way to make money playing Axie Infinity. You can build your own extensions and sell them for real money. There are several websites where you can find players who are looking for extensions. You can build a custom extension that will match their style. Once you are finished, you can sell it to them for a profit. There are some sites where you can build extensions for other players. They will pay you a fee for building their extension. 3. Designing items Designing items is a way to make money playing Axie Infinity. If you are creative, you can design your own items. You can make use of the in-game tools and then submit your item to the marketplace. Once it is approved, you can start selling it to other players. You can find several people who are looking for custom items. You can also find people who will pay you a fee to design their items. 4. Running a Marketplace Running a marketplace is another way to make money playing Axie Infinity. If you are willing to spend a few hours a week, you can make money by running a marketplace. It is a good idea to run a marketplace that is focused on selling items and builds. If you sell builds, you can use MyShop to sell them. If you sell items, you can use a marketplace like SellPak.

Nicholas Truglia, 21, was found guilty in a Manhattan court on November 14 for stealing 750,000 in cryptocurrency from one person and 450,000 from another. In addition, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office (DANY) said Truglia was sentenced to pay 762,000 in restitution to his victims, and a further 100,000 to his other victims, with more victims set to be added to the indictment. Truglia was also sentenced to pay a 100,000 fine, in addition to his 10 year prison sentence. The three counts on which Truglia was sentenced were: first-degree identity theft, computer tampering, and grand larceny. Truglia's arrest came after a six-month investigation by the DANY, with the help of the US Secret Service and the New York Police Department. ""This case should serve as a wake-up call to all who own digital currency,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. ""The lucrative allure of virtual currencies continues to incentivize bad actors to exploit unsuspecting investors, and my Office will continue to investigate and prosecute those who do."" Truglia is not the only SIM swapper to be convicted by US authorities this year. In April, another SIM swapper, Joseph Harris, 22, of Massachusetts was sentenced to 10 years in prison for SIM swapping and stealing 14 million worth of cryptocurrencies. Harris and Truglia operated in parallel, with Truglia's scam starting in October 2018, and Harris's starting a month later, in November. Both were eventually arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison, and both were also ordered to pay back the money they stole. Authorities said the two men didn't know each other and were operating in parallel, but according to a Wired report from earlier this year, the two may have crossed paths in a private Telegram group, where hackers would talk about their SIM swapping attacks.

Supporters of the executive order argue that tech companies have too much power and influence over public discourse, while opponents argue that the order is an attempt to stifle free speech and could have unintended consequences for online platforms and the internet as a whole. It is important to note that the executive order does not have the power to change the law on its own, and any changes to Section 230 would require congressional action.

Trump signed the order in reaction to Twitter fact-checking two of his tweets earlier in the week where he made false and misleading claims about mail-in voting and voter fraud. Repealing or limiting Section 230 of the Community Decency Act may result in more restricted speech online as companies will not want to be exposed to the potential liability for everything their users want to say.

In recent years, social media platforms have come under scrutiny for allowing misinformation to flourish on their platforms. After the 2016 presidential election, it was revealed that Russian operatives had used the platform to spread disinformation. Facebook, Twitter and Google were called before Congress to answer for their role in allowing misinformation to spread on their platforms.

LLAMA,tldr-213,"The US Navy is planning to expand its fleet so that there will be two small warships to every large warship by 2030. In order to do this, they plan to take older destroyers that are still operational, and upgrade them with new technologies. The Navy would like to have the upgraded vessels ready for combat within five years. They plan to start with the USS Spruance, the USS Ramage and the USS Decatur. These ships are all 30 years old, but still in service. These ships are also all named for famous American officers who served in World War II. The Navy has many older ships that are still in service, and this could be an effective way to keep them operational for longer. It's also a great way to update their technology without spending a fortune. There are many older ships that could benefit from an upgrade. There are also some ships that are not in service that could be taken from ""mothballs"" and upgraded as well. By 2030, the Navy would like to have 355 ships. In order to have enough money to pay for the upgrades and other equipment, they have asked Congress for a 20 billion dollar increase in the annual budget. It's a big investment, but one that could pay for itself in the long run. We'll be watching to see how this Navy investment plays out."

In order to do this, they plan to order a fleet of unmanned vessels (UVs). UVs are less expensive to produce as their designs do not need to consider spaces and support equipment for onboard human operators. The unmanned warships will be able to perform better than warships with humans for long-duration missions that might be physically taxing for human operators, or other missions that pose a high risk of injury, death, or capture by the enemy. In the next five years, the Navy plans to spend a total of 4.5 billion to accelerate the development of three different types of UVs."

In order to do this, they plan to build 20 new small warships and retire 10 older large warships. The new small warships will be built in American shipyards, and the Navy will purchase the ships using funds that have already been appropriated by Congress. The Navy believes that this plan will strengthen the fleet and make it more responsive to changing threats. The new small warships will be a variety of types, including frigates, corvettes, and littoral combat ships. They will be equipped with a variety of weapons and sensors, and they will be able to operate in a variety of environments, including littoral waters and the open ocean. The Navy believes that these new ships will be able to respond to a variety of threats, including piracy, drug trafficking, and terrorism. The Navy's plan to expand its fleet has been met with some criticism. Some analysts have argued that the Navy is spending too much money on new ships and that it should instead focus on maintaining its existing fleet. Others have argued that the Navy's plan is not ambitious enough and that it should build more ships. The Navy's plan to expand its fleet is a significant undertaking. However, the Navy believes that it is necessary to ensure that the fleet is prepared for the challenges of the 21st century."

HQ had received an acquisition offer from an established business but the deal didn't go through. The HQ Trivia app launched in 2017 and it quickly became popular due to its novel live nature, real cash prizes, and Scott Rogowsky playing the game's host. As the game became less popular, HQ tried to keep users engaged through extra in-game lives and an in-person event with a cash prize, but eventually, the game's novelty wore off and the company wasn't able to keep its users interested in its games."

Yusupov said that the company had been struggling financially for some time, and that the pandemic had made it even harder to turn a profit. ""We had hoped that we could weather the storm, but it became clear that we could not,"" he wrote. HQ Trivia was a live trivia game show that was broadcast on the internet. Players could compete for cash prizes by answering questions correctly. The show was popular for its high-stakes format and its charismatic host, Scott Rogowsky. However, the show's popularity waned in recent months, and it was unable to attract enough new viewers. Yusupov said that he was proud of what HQ had accomplished in its short life. ""We built something truly special,"" he wrote. ""We brought joy to millions of people around the world, and we helped to create a new kind of entertainment."" HQ's closure is another sign of the challenges facing the live streaming industry. Many live streaming platforms have struggled to find a sustainable business model, and some have been forced to close down."

""While HQ Trivia was an incredibly fun and successful app, we are unable to raise the capital needed to keep the company going.

Trivia Crack co-founder Chris Larsen was not immediately available for comment. The New York-based HQ Trivia launched in March and quickly became a huge hit. The daily trivia game was hosted by comedian James Corden and featured celebrities and athletes taking on 20-question rounds. The company said it had 30 million daily users and 50 million monthly users, and raked in 5 million in advertising revenue per month. But the app's meteoric rise came at a steep price.

(And don't worry: You can still do this while social distancing.) Inclusion is something we are working hard at at Unifor Local 1902 because it is one way our union members can thrive within their workplace environment. This past week I had the opportunity to attend an employer awareness seminar hosted by Unisys located here in Toronto (also known as Stratford Ontario). A couple months ago my job held discussions about how they wanted all their employees to be able to participate in a number of programs including the following: I am not going into detail on what these additional benefits entail but suffice it to say there has been some very positive discussion regarding those two things being included in your employee benefit package if you happen to work for Unisys. It also comes down to making sure your management team stays open minded when it comes to having different ideas or opinions firsthand! They have worked so long and done so much but unfortunately sometimes just as often times employers tend to feel intimidated by new ideas or opinions which makes them hesitant to embrace change. Remembering why you're doing something matters a lot especially during these uncertain times where everyone is dealing with anxiety particularly health related issues due to COVID-19. We get asked quite frequently ""What's your current goal""? And after thinking deeply about that question for several days I've come up with three personal goals. As most of us know the ability to adapt to changing circumstances from day-to-day seems increasingly difficult to accomplish nowadays. Doing daily tasks becomes less important until there isn't even time left over to think about anything else until it's too late! Every morning I wake up knowing that I will not stop trying to find out who God wants me to be next year whether that's physically or emotionally speaking. See I'm not talking about searching for answers - I mean seeking Him through every step of life! If we don't seek Christ regularly He'll soon forget to show us any signs leading to His presence. As the Bible tells us .....He knows what we need before we ask Him for it. Have you ever appreciated someone enough to make time to spend quality alone-time together?! If yes then definitely let him know he was worth spending his valuable time with today! (Editor Note: The following post contains affiliate links promoting products we love...

Instead despite suffering extreme backaches throughout the entirety of her pregnancy she did opt for epidural anesthesia rather than natural labor pains. Not only does watching one's baby grow inside another woman seem miraculous yet incredibly humbling at the same time but she says many women prefer analgesia instead of allowing themselves to experience the full spectrum of physical sensations. The reason why numerous obstetricians recommend giving an infant naturally via c-section or forceps even though previously offered options might cause severe trauma is typically based off psychological factors pertaining to mother-infant bonding. Not wanting to be separated from their precious newborn for whatever reasons parents may choose to forego medical intervention. Most insurance companies require mothers requesting routine cesareans to have adequate coverage however no matter whichever option you decide to pursue medical professionals always advise against using synthetic drugs prior to delivery whenever possible. To avoid needing painkillers multiple doctors suggest waiting 36 hours between doses purchased over-the-counter in order to provide sufficient time for the body to detoxify itself. Another popular alternative recommended by physicians could involve taking safe herbal supplements focused specifically on relieving discomfort associated with childbirth. Some supplement manufacturers offer caffeine-free energy drinks containing guarana extract alongside propolis extracts proven effective in reducing pre-eclampsia symptoms among pregnant women. One study conducted right around the holidays indicated ginger root taken internally was considered beneficial in easing preterm labor amongst 12 healthy 25-34-year-old female volunteers assigned equally randomized to either placebo or 2gkgday dried ginger rhizome once per day while awaiting onset of labor. Other studies supporting effectiveness of orange juice concentrate fortified with lycopene, beta-carotene, vitamin C and E, lutein zeaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol found decreased frequency of premature deliveries along with fewer cases of low birth weight infants born compared to group receiving usual diet. Personal opinion aside the bottom line remains; medical practitioners believe consuming fruit juices rich in antioxidants play key roles decreasing risk of adverse outcomes e.g. gestational diabetes hypertension and premature rupture of membranes"

Don't get me wrong there's nothing quite like having real coffee mugs made especially for yourself but sometimes it's nice if we don't have to lug around real mugs all day long... Here's another good reason not to lug around real pottery pieces every single time you want some hot drinks: they're expensive... which means you're probably going to have to replace them frequently too unless you find an amazing deal online! This isn't really true anymore thanks to mug warehouses though - particularly when they come up with sale deals after sales...

The study equipped cuttlefish with little 3D glasses and placed them in front of a screen with a 3D movie of a shrimp passing by. When the cuttlefish saw the shrimp, they attempted to grab it with their tentacles. This behavior shows that cuttlefish are capable of binocular vision. Many other animals also share similar vision systems. While other animals have eyes that look at the same thing at the same time, cuttlefish eyes are able to move independently from each other.

Tsinghua,tldr-221,"Our brain perceives what we see in 3D by processing and combining the images from both of our eyes. A new study shows that cuttlefish also perceive the world similarly. The researchers used 3D technology to film a cuttlefish swimming in front of a mirror. As expected, the cuttlefish saw its own image in the mirror, but the researchers were surprised to see that the cuttlefish also saw a ""mirror image"" of its prey. Cuttlefish use their beaks to catch and eat small crustaceans called nemerteans. When the cuttlefish saw its own image in the mirror, it swam toward the mirror, grabbed the nemertean and ate it. When the researchers put a nemertean in front of the cuttlefish's eyes, it did not see the nemertean, but it did see the nemertean's mirror image. The researchers concluded that the cuttlefish's brain uses its two eyes to process the images of the world, but it uses the mirror to see objects it needs to eat."
LLAMA,tldr-221,"Our brain perceives what we see in 3D by processing and combining the images from both of our eyes. A new study shows that cuttlefish also perceive the world similarly. Like humans, cuttlefish use information from both of their eyes to form a 3D view of the world around them. This was shown in a new study that revealed that the cuttlefish's visual system functions similar to that of humans. ""Our results suggest that the cuttlefish visual system is similar to that of humans and primates,"" said Vivek Nityananda, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and the first author of the study. Scientists had previously shown that vertebrates use the differences between the images from each eye to perceive depth. It is called stereopsis, and the ability is believed to be absent in invertebrates like cuttlefish. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the cuttlefish's eyes were working together to create a 3D image, similar to the way human eyes do. The team designed a setup with two screens and a cylinder where cuttlefish swam. They showed different images on each screen and created an illusion of depth. They then observed how the cuttlefish responded to the images. By observing the cuttlefish's eye movements, they found that the invertebrates reacted to the illusion of depth. This shows that the cuttlefish's visual system is using the differences between the images from each eye to perceive depth, similar to the way human eyes do. The study could provide insight into how 3D vision evolved in animals."

In fact, they use their eye movements to draw a representation of its environment. In this case, however, these representations are not useful for navigation or key-shortcuts but can guide them with regard to orientation. To do so, researchers at the Ullens Center for Animal Cognition performed experiments on eight adult male cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis). They were placed inside an aquarium where two identical arenas could be viewed through transparent Plexiglas glasses mounted underwater. The animals were then given different tasks: first, they needed to find food within each arena; secondly, perform walking maneuvers around obstacles - for example, walk along one side of one object while turning another way - and finally make turns back toward the start position without touching any objects. ""Cuttlefish have evolved complex cognitive skills such as learning, memory formation, decision-making, response selection [...] And now we're revealing how they may navigate using visual information gathered over time"" After exploring all possible configurations, it turned out that when looking straight ahead, the fish always made unambiguous decisions about which direction was up. When facing 90 towards either end of its territory, the decision was less clear-cut because there is no obvious point of reference to choose between left and right. However, if you tilted your head slightly away from the horizon, regardless of whether moving left or right would lead to reaching the goal faster, the fish tended to turn directly off of the line connecting origin to destination. This suggests that despite having only four optic flow detectors - three corresponding to horizontal and vertical motion directions, respectively - the cuttlefish draws 3-D maps based on 2-D input in order to create smooth paths between all starting points and goals. These results indicate that even though most movement sequences appear similar across species, single behaviors differ substantially among individuals according to specific environmental conditions or individual experience. One possibility is that the evolutionary advantage of navigating in large three-dimensional spaces might help explain why more sophisticated models of spatial cognition evolve throughout animal evolution. Interestingly enough, besides being able to adjust their viewpoint relative to gravity, humans take into account other cues, like body posture and landmarks. Cuttlefish seem to do exactly the opposite and rely solely upon two-dimensional inputs provided by cameras stabilized on their heads.

The FDA has now approved this genetic health risk report as a direct-to-consumer genetic test. The FDA believes that this test can help people make decisions regarding their health and lifestyle. 23andMe will test for genetic health risks for BRCA1BRCA2 (selected variants), late-onset Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, early-onset primary dystonia, factor XI deficiency, Gaucher disease type 1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hereditary thrombophilia. The test will also screen for drug responses, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and VKORC1. These genes impact how well people metabolize drugs such as warfarin, Coumadin, Plavix, and clopidogrel. The test will also screen for the following diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, primary dystonia, factor XI deficiency, Gaucher disease type 1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hereditary thrombophilia. Women who carry genetic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer, and may be at increased risk of other cancers. 23andMe will also report a person's carrier status for the following diseases: Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, Fanconi anemia group C, Fanconi anemia group G, familial dysautonomia, Gaucher disease type 1, glycogen storage disease type 1A, hereditary hemochromatosis, Mucolipidosis type IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Rett syndrome, and Tay-Sachs disease. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can be passed down from either parent, and the child of a parent with one of these mutations has a 50 chance of inheriting the mutation. If a person's test results indicate that they are a carrier of one of these mutations, it does not mean that they have or will develop the disorder, but rather that they can pass the mutation down to their children. According to the FDA, this test will give people information about possible mutations that are linked to increased risk for conditions that could be avoided or effectively treated.

BigScience,tldr-224,"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate light in a frequency-dependent manner by modifying its phase or amplitude at specific frequencies, and they have been used for many applications ranging from sensing to cloaking. [2] [3] [4] [5] Recently there has also been considerable interest in extracting electromagnetic (EM) energy out of metamaterial-based sources such as lenses, antennas, near-field converters, etc., which is intrinsically related with directional controllability. 6 In this work we propose an approach based on metasurface to achieve polarization conversion between two orthogonal linear polarizations. Side-coupled dipole antenna The proposed design consists of a pair of parallel metal patches placed on top of each other overlaid with dielectric substrate (Fig. 1). The geometry parameters are: L 15 mm; W 20 mm; h s 0.5mm; d 3 mm; r 10.16 j0.067i, tan 5 10 3; and thickness t 4 mm. When excited it produces electric field along x-direction E y and magnetic field H z. This configuration allows us to couple directly pairs of dipoles into Yee cells through ports 2 3 shown in Fig.1 (b). By setting q 11 1, q 12 1 and q 21 1, q 22 1, Gaussian beam propagating normally towards -z-axis from port2 will be captured by the first patch while linearly polarized plane wave arriving from midpoint of x-axis passing through ports 23 will propagate around second one due to opposite sign of mutual impedance. The resulting scattering matrix S xy defined as: where, Note that when S 1, Z 1, i.e. I m Y m , then Z BPW and because of finite width of coplanar waveguide where beams pass through, these reflections must exit back through ports 1 3. However if S 1, there is no reflection back though ports 13 since only left half space is occupied by the structure. Thus in order to block all reflected waves coming down from right hand side of transmission line, appropriate values of S matrices should be chosen so that: S 1; to ensure perfect match condition at terminal openings as indicated in Fig. 1. Polarisation converstion using surface plasmon resonance phenomena A simple way to realize switching between different input states would be to actively switch among them via electrically controlled terminals depicted schematically in Fig. 2. As previous analysis shows in place of passive termination (open circuited terminations), active output couplers provide more flexibility for controlling the excitation level. Active circuits can be incorporated either before the feed network [resistive load] or after the final matching networks [inductors andor capacitors] to produce additional degrees of freedom. In our case three active elements were added: resistive loads R l, inductor C l and capacitor C p connected in cascade. Since injecting currents directly into A m leads to large oscillations of current magnitudephase caused by high coupling coefficient k 13 4L 90 between ports 24, therefore BPA series resonances are exploited here. These resonant conditions mediated by the parasitic capacitance of active element can effectively suppress unwanted radiation effects [ Figs. Two-port half-plane array with multiple inputs Discussion on implementation details Let us now consider how to implement the presented equivalent circuit model within physical system. We start off considering a basic two-ports aperture, represented in terms of electrical length el given by: , denotes wavelength correspondingly). For instance, for a simple slotline, split-ring-loaded monopole antenna and microstrip aperture, appropriate values of e can be found according to: n f 1 and cf o 1 respectively. For the particular device under investigation, we choose w 40 mm, thus the characteristic modular size is approximately equal to 83 m for SiO 2 permittivity r 9.85 limited to maximum operating wavelengths less than max 10m. Both slots dimensions satisfy requirements stated above concerning minimum metallic material required to obtain Q-factor greater 100 without reducing bandwidth too much. Note that the obtained value of f o is consistent with theoretical results stating the threshold radiated power for arbitrary gap-width being proportional to g and inversely proportional to ground plane area. 7 Now we proceed by placing four identical arrays inside a cylindrical cavity containing air underneath 100 radm 2 refractive index surrounding medium. The distance from center axis to array edge was kept constant throughout the process of designing reflecting surfaces. Therefore although not explicitly expressed in equations, assumed idealized shape of reflector does indeed correspond to a cylinder having diameter 58mm and height 35mm (see inset in Fig. 5).

LLAMA,tldr-224,"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate the behavior of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. They have been fabricated with various designs that give them interesting properties, such as the ability to be invisible to microwave radiation, or to focus terahertz radiation. In a paper published in Nano Letters, scientists have developed a design for a metasurface that is capable of a much more sophisticated manipulation of light than previously reported metasurfaces. The new design, developed by scientists at the University of California, San Diego and at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is a sheet of silicon that contains an array of tiny pillars, each of which is a different height. When light hits the metasurface, it encounters the pillars. Depending on the height of the pillars, the light can be reflected or transmitted through. ""This is the first metasurface capable of manipulating the phase, amplitude, polarization and direction of light at the same time and in a reversible way,"" said Boubacar Kante, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. The ability to manipulate light's direction is particularly important. The researchers have calculated that the metasurface could be used to create so-called vector beams, which have controllable shapes. These beams can be used to manipulate particles as small as atoms. ""You can imagine a flat lens made of this metasurface that can be programmed to create vector beams that have different shapes, like a vortex or spherical beam,"" said Alexandra Boltasseva, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. ""This type of flat lens will be extremely useful for applications where a regular lens cannot be used, like in the human body. It will also be useful in optoelectronic devices that use polarized light, such as solar cells and sensors."" The researchers still have to figure out how to fabricate the new metasurface. Kante says that the pillars need to be about 100 nanometers in diameter and spaced about 100 nanometers apart in order to work."

Tsinghua,tldr-224,"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate light in a variety of ways. Light can be manipulated in a metasurface by changing the surface, in effect changing the wave pattern of the light. By changing the surface the wave pattern of the light can be altered and the metasurface can control the phase and amplitude of the light. The result is a metasurface that can manipulate the wave pattern of light in a way that is similar to lenses, filters and prisms. A metasurface can also change the phase of light in a wave pattern that is similar to that of an interferometer. This allows a metasurface to manipulate light in a wave pattern that is similar to that of a mirror. A metasurface can also create an interference pattern in a wave pattern that is similar to that of a diffraction grating. This can be used to diffract light in a wave pattern that is similar to that of a prism. The surface area of the metasurface that interacts with the light determines the overall size of the metasurface. In order to make a small metasurface, a flat mirror can be used.

A refresh token is a token that is used to authenticate your third-party application to your Twilio phone number. The refresh token is the only token that is needed to authenticate your third-party application to your Twilio phone number."
BigScience,tldr-225,"Learn how OAuth is actually used in the real world. We cover topics like the eight common OAuth modes, how to use the Authorization Code grant, and why you should never trust an authorization server. The first section of this course covers a lot more than just authentication - it explains what OAuth is all about, its historical origins, and investigates some very important security questions that surround it. After each topic covered here has been thoroughly explained, we dive into a practical explanation of exactly how an implementation can be built using one or more libraries such as OpenID Connect (OIDC), Google's Android Authenticator, Facebook SDK for iOS, Instagram SDK for iOS, Microsoft's Real Time Authentication Service (RATAS) library, Twitter API, etc., depending on your needs. If you're interested in learning more about open-source tools available to developers who are building their own authentication solutions, then take my recommendation list with a grain of salt: Unfortunately there aren't many great free options out there at this time but if you've got big budget up front, check these out:"
OpenAI,tldr-225,"Learn how OAuth is actually used in the real world. We cover topics like the eight common OAuth modes, how to use the Authorization Code grant, and why you should consider using OAuth for your application's authentication and authorization needs. OAuth (Open Authorization) is a widely used protocol that allows applications to authenticate and authorize users to access their resources on third-party services (e.g. social media platforms, SaaS applications, etc.) without the need for the users to reveal their username and password to the application. OAuth works through a series of steps and modes, with different modes suited for different use cases. Here are the eight common OAuth modes and scenarios for their usage: 1. Authorization Code Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a user's resources on a third-party service. The user is redirected to the third-party service and asked to authorize access to their data. Once authorized, the third-party service redirects the user back to your application with an authorization code that your application can exchange for an access token. 2. Client Credentials Grant: This mode is used when your application is acting on its own behalf and requires access to a user's resources on a third-party service. Your application authenticates with the third-party service using its own credentials and receives an access token in return. 3. Implicit Grant: This mode is used for public clients (applications that run on the user's device) when your application needs to access a user's resources on a third-party service. Unlike the Authorization Code grant, the access token is obtained directly from the third-party service, bypassing the need for an authorization code. 4. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a user's resources on a third-party service and the user is willing to share their username and password with your application. The user's credentials are exchanged for an access token. 5. Device Authorization Grant: This mode is used for devices with limited input capabilities (e.g., smart TVs) that require user interaction to authorize access to third-party services. The user is provided with a device code that they enter on a web page or another device, and the access token is obtained once the user grants authorization. 6. Refresh Token Grant: This mode is used when an access token expires or becomes invalid, and your application needs to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthorize your application. 7. JWT Bearer Token Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a protected resource using a JSON Web Token instead of an access token. 8. SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a protected resource using a SAML 2.0 assertion instead of an access token. The Authorization Code grant, also known as the three-legged OAuth or web flow, is the most commonly used mode of OAuth in the industry. It is preferred over other modes because it offers better security and user experience. With the Authorization Code grant, your application never sees the user's credentials and instead receives an access token that it can use to access the user's resources on the third-party service. OAuth is a popular choice for authentication and authorization because it offers several benefits over traditional approaches, such as: - Increased security: OAuth enables secure, centralized authorization for multiple applications and services, reducing the risk of breaches or unauthorized access. - Improved user experience: Users can authorize access to their data without disclosing their credentials to third-party applications, enhancing privacy and trust. - Easier integration: OAuth provides a standard way to authenticate and authorize access to third-party services, reducing the need for custom integrations and making it simpler to add new services to your application. Overall, OAuth is a powerful tool for implementing robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication and authorization models in your applications."

Tsinghua,tldr-226,"Many things can be done to make animals live longer, even though we don't know exactly why these things work. These can include changing diets, taking certain drugs, or special exercise programs. The one that I've seen the most success with is one that involves cranberries. It's been known for many years that cranberries can protect against heart disease, but it was only in the 1990s that they were discovered to be effective in reducing the risk of death from all causes. That discovery is what led to a significant increase in their use in Europe, where they've been a common food for centuries. In the United States, however, cranberries have been available for only about a decade. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration gave them a low ""generally recognized as safe"" rating. As a result, their use is spreading rapidly. The results of a recent study showed that cranberry juice reduced the risk of dying by 15 percent, and of dying from heart disease by 18 percent. The study also found that cranberry juice helped to lower the risk of death from cancer by 10 percent. It also had an effect on deaths from strokes and dementia. Cranberry juice is made from the juice of the cranberry itself, which is produced by the cranberry plant. The juice is then concentrated, and it is sometimes added to a fruit juice drink. You can also get it in a concentrated form in a bottle. Cranberry juice is also available in the form of a supplement. It can be a good idea to take a cranberry supplement if you don't like the taste of the juice. Cranberry juice also contains antioxidants, which are natural substances that can reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. The antioxidants found in cranberries include proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins. Cranberry juice has also been found to have a mild cholesterol-lowering effect. This is one of the most important ways that cranberry juice helps to lower the risk of death from heart disease. In addition to helping to lower the risk of death from heart disease, cranberry juice also helps to lower the risk of death from stroke. It is also known to help to lower the risk of death from dementia. Cranberry juice has also been found to have a positive effect on the risk of death from cancer. The mechanism for this effect is not well understood. The amount of cranberry juice you should take varies with the type of supplement you are taking. If you are taking cranberry juice in a supplement, the most common dosage is 15 to 20 drops per day. If you are taking cranberry juice in a juice drink, the recommended dosage is 3 to 4 cups per day. Cranberry juice can also be taken as a supplement that contains both cranberry juice and cranberry powder. Cranberry juice has also been found to have a positive effect on the risk of death from diabetes. This is especially true for those who have had diabetes for more than ten years. However, this effect is not as strong as that found for cranberry juice for the risk of death from heart disease. As with cranberry juice, cranberry powder can be added to your diet. You can buy cranberry powder in a powder form in most health food stores. However, you can also get cranberry powder in the form of a supplement. The recommended dosage for cranberry powder is 15 to 20 drops per day. You can also take cranberry powder in a supplement that contains both cranberry powder and cranberry juice. In addition to the benefits of cranberry juice and cranberry powder, cranberries also have many other health benefits. Cranberries are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin A, niacin, vitamin B1, magnesium, manganese, and iron. Cranberries also have an unusually high concentration of anthocyanins, which are antioxidant compounds. Cranberries are high in fiber, which can help to lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In addition, they are high in lutein, a substance that has been found to help to prevent age-related macular degeneration. In addition, cranberries have been found to help to prevent the development of cataracts. Baking and Cooking Cranberries are very high in pectin, a substance that can help to keep baked goods from sticking together. They also have a mild tart flavor that can be used to cut the sweetness of other foods. They are also used to add a mild tart flavor to desserts. In addition, cranberries are often used to add a bright red color to food. They are used in pies, tarts, cobblers, and other desserts. They can also be used to make jams, jellies, sauces, and compotes."

LLAMA,tldr-226,"Many things can be done to make animals live longer, even though we don't know exactly why these things work. These can include changing diets, taking certain drugs, or special genetic manipulations. Genetic manipulations can help us learn how to make animals live longer. For instance, if you have a group of animals and give them a particular drug, then they live longer, you don't know whether it was the drug that made them live longer, or if something else about them allowed them to live longer. But if you genetically engineer the animals to make them have a certain gene, and then they live longer, it is very likely that the gene made the animals live longer. There are many genes that have been shown to affect aging. One way to manipulate genes is to mutate them to make them not work. A gene that has been mutated in this way is called a null allele. There are many null alleles of genes that affect longevity. Some null alleles include: Age-1 (daf-2) These mutants live about twice as long as normal, wild-type animals. If-1 (daf-16) These mutants live about twice as long as normal, wild-type animals, and are resistant to stress and disease. Age-1 and If-1 are usually used together because they have stronger effects when they are both mutated than when they are mutated alone. Other mutations: Insulin-like signaling (Insulin-like Growth Factor - IGF-1) mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) Many drugs can be used to make animals live longer. In general, these drugs are not useful for people to take to live longer, but are very useful for figuring out how aging works. These drugs are sometimes called geroprotectors. These drugs include: Rapamycin (and other mTOR inhibitors) Lithium chloride (and other GSK-3 inhibitors) PPAR agonists Sirtuin activators Perhaps the most exciting research being done right now is using gene therapy to make animals live longer. These gene therapies are designed to work differently than drugs. With drugs, you have to keep taking them every day for a long time, or else the effect stops. But with gene therapy, a gene is put into the animal, so it keeps working all the time, without the animal having to keep taking a drug. Gene therapy is already being used for some diseases. You can read more about gene therapy on the Gene Therapy Information Network website. And here is a video about how it works: Different gene therapies have been used to make animals live longer. For example, one study used gene therapy to increase levels of telomerase. Another study used gene therapy to cause the body to produce more of a protein called SIRT1. What do you think is the most promising research for making animals live longer?"

The xEMU is designed to be more flexible and easier to wear than the Mark III suit. It has better joints, shoulder and elbow mobility, and more flexibility at the waist and hips. It is also designed to work with two different sizes of spacesuits. Astronauts who are medium-sized or smaller can use a medium-sized suit, and larger astronauts can use a larger suit. The xEMU is made up of a number of different parts. A backpack called a Portable Life Support System (PLSS) provides oxygen and water to the astronaut wearing the suit. Another part, called the Hard Upper Torso (HUT), is a hard plastic shell that fits around the astronaut's upper body, and provides more structure and mobility to the suit. The xEMU also has new helmets and gloves, which are designed to be more flexible and easier to wear. Moving around on the surface of the Moon is easier for astronauts wearing the xEMU. It has special boots which allow astronauts to walk, run, and even hop around on the Moon. The suit also has lights, communications, and computer systems that allow astronauts to communicate with other astronauts and mission control. The xEMU is part of NASA's Constellation Program.

NASA has plans to use the xEMU in a variety of applications including: Lunar surface exploration Extravehicular activity in the lunar environment In the event of an emergency in lunar orbit The suit was developed by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and tested by the US Air Force Research Laboratory in Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The suit has been nicknamed ""Buzz Lightyear"" by NASA for its resemblance to the movie character. It is the first suit to be used by humans on the Moon and the first in the history of space exploration to have a digital display. NASA originally intended the suit to be used on the Lunar Prospector mission, but it was later decided to use it for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission instead. Design The xEMU is a large, space-rated suit with features designed to protect the astronaut from a variety of lunar surface conditions. The suit is designed to have the astronaut reach and touch the lunar surface with minimal effort. The suit has two control surfaces: a palm-like section at the base of the suit and a clevis which allows the astronaut to rotate the entire suit 360 degrees. The suit is fully adjustable in length and width. It is built to fit astronauts with a variety of body types. The suit was designed to be more comfortable than earlier suits such as the Apollo suit. The suit has a more rounded design to minimize the pressure on the torso and the limbs. The suit also has increased insulation and a breathable membrane that allows the astronaut to breathe without removing the suit. The suit is constructed from two parts: a chest piece and a back piece. The chest piece is a garment that covers the torso, while the back piece covers the lower torso, legs, and feet. The back piece has a mechanism that allows the astronaut to lift the entire back piece to allow access to the suit. The chest piece has a sleeve that is worn around the astronaut's arm, and it has a pocket to carry items. The back piece has a sleeve that is worn around the astronaut's leg, and it has a pocket to carry items. The back piece has a pocket on the back which is used to store items. The suit has a helmet, which has a visor and a 10-inch display. The visor has a tinted visor which protects the astronaut from the glare of the sun. The visor also has a touch screen display to show the astronauts status. The helmet also has a pair of earphones and a mouthpiece.

The hotel uses facial recognition technology for many services, and the company has plans to expand its smart hotel model into a chain. While this is a 1-of-a-kind example, it does highlight the importance of integration across the board for a seamless guest experience. Just like the hotel, operators in the restaurant and retail sector are looking at ways to make it easier for customers to order and pay for items. This is evident in the growing trend for mobile ordering and payment. According to Statista, mobile ordering will grow by 57 in 2019. McDonald's and Chipotle have been early adopters of this technology, allowing customers to order from their mobile devices and skip the line. In addition, 55 of consumers said they would pay more for a better customer experience. The key for mobile ordering is to give customers a seamless experience that is fast, easy, and intuitive. That's where a skilled integration partner comes in. An integration partner should be able to provide a seamless, frictionless mobile ordering system. It should be easy to use and work in concert with other systems, such as the POS system, to provide a complete ordering and payment experience. Technology is also changing how customers interact with their favorite brands. One big change is the growth of social media. Customers now use Twitter and Facebook to not only communicate with friends and family, but also to get news and share information. Restaurant and retail operators are using social media to reach out to customers and offer specials, promotions, and discounts. Savvy restaurant and retail operators are using social media to learn more about customers and reach out to them. A good integration partner will be able to incorporate social media platforms into the customer experience. Social media can be integrated into the website, mobile app, or even the in-store ordering system to make it easier for customers to order and pay. In addition, the integration partner will be able to incorporate loyalty programs so customers can receive rewards and special offers.

They can also order room service and pay for their stay using the app. The hotel even has a robot chef that can cook a variety of dishes. FlyZoo is part of Alibaba's larger goal to create a ""new retail"" experience that is more convenient and efficient for consumers. The company believes that automation can help to improve customer service and reduce costs. FlyZoo is still in its early stages, but it is already attracting a lot of attention from both consumers and investors.

Tsinghua,tldr-229,"Stories of data loss can be embarrassing, but they help people learn useful things in case they end up in similar situations. This article tells the story of how a security team found and fixed a data loss vulnerability in a web application. This vulnerability was originally reported to us by the security team at the organization that owns the application. It was a good story to share, but there were a few things we could have done better, and a few lessons we can learn from. The Vulnerability We received a security report from the security team at a client organization. The report detailed how the client's web application was exposed to remote attackers through a local file path vulnerability. The client's web application, which we'll call ""App1,"" is a web application built on top of the Django framework. The web application uses Django's standard model, forms, and template engine to generate web pages for users. The web application is built on top of Django's standard application framework and uses the standard web server. When users access App1, they are presented with a login screen. After they enter their credentials and click on the ""Login"" button, the web application requests the user's session from the user's database. The web application then uses that session information to generate a page that the user is presented with. The user can then use that page to navigate through the application. The web application allows users to save their work to a ""Documents"" directory on the web server. Documents are represented as Django models. This is a pretty standard web application. The vulnerabilities in the application are not related to the standard Django application framework or web server. They are related to the way the application handles file paths. The Client's Solution The client took immediate action to fix the vulnerability. They deployed a patch that corrected the file path vulnerability in the web application. Unfortunately, this patch did not fix the vulnerability in the client's database. The vulnerability in the database was caused by the way the client handled file paths in their code. When a user logs in to App1, they are given a session token. The session token is used to validate that the user is who they say they are. When the user saves a document, the web application uses the session token to check to see if the user is authorized to save the document. If the user is authorized, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. The session token is saved in the user's database. When a user logs in, the web application checks the user's database to see if the user's session token is in the database. If the user's session token is in the database, the web application assumes that the user is logged in and that they have a valid session token. The web application uses the user's session token to access the user's session in the database. The web application uses the session to validate that the user is who they say they are. If the user is authorized, the web application writes the user's document to the Documents directory. The problem is that the web application did not check to see if the user's session token was in the user's database before writing the document to the Documents directory. The web application did not validate that the user's session token was in the user's database before writing the document to the Documents directory. This allowed attackers to exploit a vulnerability in the database to steal documents from users. When the web application attempts to write a document to the Documents directory, the web application uses the session token to check to see if the user is authorized to save the document. The web application uses the session token to check to see if the user is authorized to save the document. The web application checks the session token in the database. If the session token is not in the database, the web application raises an exception. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. The web application checks the session token in the database. If the session token is not in the database, the web application raises an exception. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. The web application checks the session token in the database. If the session token is not in the database, the web application raises an exception. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory. If the session token is in the database, the web application uses the session token to write the document to the Documents directory."

OpenAI,tldr-229,"Stories of data loss can be embarrassing, but they help people learn useful things in case they end up in similar situations. This article tells the story of how a company accidentally deleted years worth of customer data and how they recovered from the loss. In this story, a small e-commerce company was in the process of migrating their website to a new content management system (CMS). During the data transfer process, they accidentally deleted the entire database containing all of their customer orders, transaction history, and product inventory. They immediately realized their mistake and tried to recover the lost data. After some investigation, they discovered that they didn't have a backup of the database for the past four years. They also realized that they didn't follow their own internal policy of backing up their data on a regular basis. They were devastated to lose years of valuable information in a snap of a finger. All their efforts and time that they invested in the growth of the company had vanished. But in the midst of despair, the team was determined to recover the lost data. They contacted their CMS provider and IT experts to pitch in and help recover their lost data. Ultimately, they were able to recover some of the lost data by combining different data sources, rebuilding the database manually, and even reaching out to some customers who still had their order confirmation emails to obtain transaction details. It took a lot of effort and time, but the team's persistence paid off. After the recovery, the company learned valuable lessons that they still abide by today. They realized the importance of regular data backups and established a new data management policy. They also ran regular data recovery simulations to ensure they were prepared for any future data loss incidents. This story serves as a cautionary tale for businesses and individuals to always prioritize data backup and establish recovery plans. It also shows that with persistence and effort, lost data can sometimes be recovered."

LLAMA,tldr-229,"Stories of data loss can be embarrassing, but they help people learn useful things in case they end up in similar situations. This article tells the story of how a user ended up losing his important data due to a ransomware attack and what he did to prevent the same from happening again. Before I tell you the story of what happened to me, I would like to tell you about ransomware and what it does. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks a user's files. The files are locked in such a way that they become inaccessible. The malware then presents a screen that asks the user to pay a ransom in order to get back their files. It is usually a crypto currency like Bitcoin. The ransomware then gives a link that can be used to make the payment. After a payment is made, the hacker will release a decryption key that will enable the user to decrypt their files. This malware can be downloaded as an email attachment or by clicking on a link. This story happened about two years ago. I was a second year student at the time. I was a victim of ransomware, and I lost my important files. The malware locked my files, and I had no way of accessing them. When the malware appeared, it demanded that I pay some money to be able to decrypt my files. I had no money at the time and decided to look for another way to decrypt my files. I tried looking for some online tools, but I had no luck. I had to wait for a few days until I came across a site that had a list of ransomware decryption tools. I downloaded a few of them, and they were not able to decrypt my files. I then realized that I had no choice but to pay the ransom. I had no money at the time, but I knew of a friend who could help me out. I asked her for the money, and she helped me out. I paid the hacker, and he sent me a decryption key. This enabled me to decrypt my files. I was very happy that I had gotten back my files. I had no other choice but to pay the ransom. I learned from this experience, and I decided to find a better way to protect my files. I searched online for some software that could help me to recover my files in case the same thing happened. I came across a data recovery software. This software was able to recover my files in the case of a ransomware attack or any other type of data loss. I have been using this software for about two years now, and I can say that I am happy with it. This software is called Disk Drill. It is available for Mac OS X and Windows. There are three versions of this software, and they are: Free, Basic and PRO. Disk Drill is capable of recovering over 200 file formats. This software can recover files from hard drives, USB drives, memory cards, iPods and other devices. This software has a simple user interface and is easy to use. It is also capable of creating an image of a drive or a partition. This software can be used to recover files that have been lost due to ransomware, accidental deletion, OS crash, partition deletion and other data loss scenarios. The free version of Disk Drill is capable of recovering up to 500MB worth of data. The Basic and PRO versions are able to recover unlimited data. I would recommend that you give this software a try. You can download the free version and see if it is good enough for you."

This brings major UI changes such as: Group chat functionality has been added based on information shared publicly about Whatsapp plans to introduce group calls in updates coming later this year. As per WABetaInfo, there will be 2 ways for users to make phone calls: 1.) using normal Call Chat function considering ""audio-only"" mode introduced when you share individual audio file; 2.) With special feature called Mixed Mode, where Messages becomes your only communication channel while making VoIPvoicevideo calls (with Camera option removed). This may change depending on whether they can get data roaming charges waived due to Covid-19 pandemic. For US carrier Verizon plan prices start at 345 for one line if unlimited minutes, text messages, and gigabytes are used monthly. Notably, Microsoft said last week that Group Calls wouldn't appear until the end of April 2021.

Utility coins are designed to be simple, easy to use, and to support a large number of transactions. Coins with utility are, in many ways, a little like utility tokens, but for a very different purpose. Utility coins are, generally, designed to facilitate some use-case, be it providing financial services or entertainment, or even both.

The semiconductor material can be doped, adding impurities to the semiconductor, to improve its electrical properties. In the case of silicon the impurity is boron or phosphorus. Doping silicon with boron creates a P-type semiconductor. Doping silicon with phosphorus creates an N-type semiconductor. Doping silicon with a mix of boron and phosphorus creates a P-N junction. The solar cell works by the P-N junction. Solar panels are connected in series. In series, the voltage of each solar cell is added together to give the total voltage. In the case of solar power, the current is not added together. To maximize power output the solar panels should be connected in parallel. In parallel, the current of each solar cell is added together to give the total current. The maximum power point is the point at which the power is at its maximum.

Tsinghua,tldr-237,"Tardigrades are microscopic extremophiles that can survive exposure to intense temperatures, pressures, and even the vacuum of space. A group of scientists recently recorded high-speed videos of the animals traversing an artificial membrane at very high speeds, and found that they were moving much faster than the membranes' natural physical properties would predict. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, is the first to experimentally investigate the locomotion of tardigrades, a group of tiny animals with tough, scaly skin that can survive extreme environments. These microscopic creatures can survive for months at temperatures ranging from -400 to 150 degrees Celsius and pressures up to 2,000 bars. Their remarkable ability to survive in hostile environments has been known for centuries, and in recent years, they have become a model organism for studying the physics of high-pressure, high-temperature materials. [See Images of the Tardigrades] Millisecond speeds While tardigrades have a limited number of basic behaviors that help them survive, scientists are interested in understanding how they move in order to gain a better understanding of how they adapt to their harsh environments. Previous studies of tardigrade locomotion have focused on observations of the animals' movements. For example, in 2016, scientists recorded the animals' movements using high-speed cameras and concluded that the animals move at speeds of up to 10 millimeters per second. But because the study relied on observations of the animals' movements, the speed of the animals' movements could not be verified experimentally. ""We want to know what the animals actually do,"" said study co-author Kristopher Tarter, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. ""We're not just looking at the animals' motions from a video; we're trying to understand how they move and how they move through a fluid."" The new study provides experimental evidence of the tardigrades' swimming speeds, which can be more than 100 times faster than the speeds observed in previous studies. The team recorded the tardigrades' movements using a transparent, semi-rigid membrane with a thin, porous cover. The tardigrades were released into the membrane and swam through it, much like the tiny organisms swim through water. By watching the animals' movements at high-speed video and tracking their movements with high-precision lasers, the researchers were able to determine the animals' speeds. The researchers also determined that the tardigrades' movements were much faster than the membrane's natural physical properties would predict. In fact, the animals' movements were faster than the membrane's own natural motion at certain points. ""The tardigrades move a little bit faster than you would think, and you have to understand that they're swimming at a much higher speed than you would expect for a typical swimming animal,"" Tarter said. The researchers recorded the tardigrades' movements at up to 100 frames per second. The videos showed that the animals traveled at a rate of up to 3 millimeters per second. At these speeds, the tardigrades could cover 300 times their own body length in just a few seconds. This corresponds to an average speed of 1.2 millimeters per second, which is 100 times faster than the speeds observed in previous studies. To track the tardigrades' movements, the researchers used two lasers and high-speed cameras to determine the animals' speeds. To determine the speed of the membrane, the researchers also used high-speed cameras. ""It's a complicated system,"" Tarter said. ""The membrane is a single layer of polymer, and the tardigrades are swimming in it. So you're trying to track a small moving object in a fluid. It's not a simple thing."" [See Images of the Tardigrades] A new propulsion mechanism The team observed that the tardigrades were able to swim in the membrane by pushing off of it with their feet. To make this observation, the researchers placed a small hole in the membrane, allowing the tardigrades to swim directly in front of it. As the tardigrades swam, the researchers observed that they would sometimes lift the membrane up and away from the bottom of the hole, and other times they would push the membrane down toward the bottom of the hole. In both cases, the tardigrades were able to move forward. ""It's a little bit counterintuitive,"" Tarter said. ""It seems like you'd have to push the membrane down, but it's actually the tardigrades that push the membrane up."" The researchers hypothesize that the tardigrades were moving forward by pushing off of the membrane, like a skateboarder pushing off of the ground."

Nanox will also use the funding to develop software that makes the technology accessible to doctors, patients and industry. Nanox's imaging technology, which is now in development, will replace the existing X-ray devices that generate 2D images, said David Michaels, Nanox's chief executive officer. The new technology will be a combination of an X-ray machine and a 3D printer. ""It's the perfect marriage of X-ray and 3D printing,"" Michaels said. ""We're able to build an object on the spot that we want to examine."" Nanox's machine will emit less radiation than conventional X-ray devices, which means that patients who need the devices for medical diagnosis will get a lower dose of radiation.

It emits less radiation and costs a fraction of the price of conventional imaging machines. The system is based on nanoparticles which emit X-rays as they pass through human tissues. Unlike regular x-ray tubes used in medical diagnostic equipment, this technology does not use gas or liquid scintillator to convert incident photons into visible light. Instead, it uses an array of nanoparticle sensors - called nanoprobes - attached to film coated with silicon dioxide (SiO2) and polystyrene to detect X-ray emission from biological samples. The number of particles reaching each sensor can be counted using standard LED-based photon-counting cameras for real-time data collection. In addition, the nano-probe's ability to generate multiple different layers of yellow fluorescence can help researchers determine how deeply their samples have penetrated tissue. ""X-ray tomography provides powerful three-dimensional structural information about soft-tissue structures such as bone marrow and organs embedded inside complex bodies like the brain,"" said Dr. Daniel Osterholm, CEO at Nanox Inc., ""This approach removes ionizing radiation limits associated with more traditional techniques while offering significant cost savings compared to other methods of CT scanning. This allows healthcare professionals greater access to whole-body imaging capabilities without having to resort to expensive desktop systems."" Nanox works under the premise of collecting data from several hundred different locations simultaneously instead of just one point as would happen if using a single camera. By taking advantage of rapid advances in computer vision algorithms, these measurements are analyzed to infer the density of objects within the sample being scanned."
LLAMA,tldr-238,"An Israeli startup, Nanox, has developed a new type of X-ray machine that generates 3D images. It emits less radiation and costs a fraction of the price of conventional imaging machines. The company's CEO is Dudu Baum, who co-founded the firm with Professor Yuval Zilberman, a serial inventor who holds 80 patents in fields such as telecommunications, semiconductors and bio-medical sensors. Baum said that, ""we have completely reinvented the way imaging is done. We started from scratch, from the chip."" The Nanox machine contains a special chip with a grid of 1,600 x 1,600 miniature detectors that capture all the information in a single X-ray shot. The company has received 5 million in investment so far and expects to raise a further 25 million to bring the product to market in 2018. The new X-ray machine is based on technology developed at Haifa's Technion university. Nanox's system is completely different from conventional machines, which use a single detector and a rotating arm to take multiple X-ray shots. Nanox's system captures all the images at once, using just one shot, thus reducing the amount of radiation and lowering the cost. The result is a 3D image that can be viewed from any angle, in sharp detail. Baum said that, ""if you want to see inside an artery, for example, you can't do it with a single shot. You need to do many shots, from different angles. We can do it with a single shot. If you want to do a CT [computerized tomography] scan, you need to do 600 slices. We can do it with one shot. And there are no moving parts, so there's nothing that can break."" The Nanox machine has a chip with 2.5 million detectors. According to Baum, ""it's 100 times more sensitive than a standard machine."" Another advantage is that it can identify materials such as bone, calcium and metal, so it can also be used for airport security. The company's first machine will be launched in 2018, at a cost of 200,000, a fraction of the price of a conventional X-ray machine. Nanox plans to sell a million machines in the next 10 years, and the total market for X-ray machines is 9 billion a year. The company is now looking to expand its workforce and grow to 200 employees over the next five years. The company has won awards for its technology, including a Wall Street Journal prize and a first place prize at the International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva."

LLAMA,tldr-239,"SQLFlow connects SQL and Tensorflow together so that SQL can be used for machine learning. SQL is a popular data storage solution, so implementing machine learning capabilities to work with SQL data would be highly beneficial. Add a new SQLFlow repository, in this case 'SQLFlow'. Add the sqlflow package. We need the latest version. Run the script to install the SQLFlow packages, including the latest Tensorflow version and MySQL driver. Run SQLFlow, and connect it to the MySQL database. First we need to read the dataset. The read query will extract all the user information from the database. In this case we select the userid and username columns. Now that we've defined the dataset, we can start predicting. The first step is to extract the user names from the dataset into a vector. The dataset has a one-hot encoding, meaning that each user name is represented by a 1, and the rest are 0's. The dot product between two user names gives the number of similar users. For example, the dot product between 'John' and 'Mike' is 0.5, because they both have a 1 for 'John' and a 0 for 'Mike'. Next, we can define the model. In this case, the model is a linear model, meaning that the prediction is a dot product between the input and the weights. In addition, we need to set the training parameters. For example, how many iterations do we want to train for, and what is our learning rate. Now we can start training. First, we need to declare the weights, which will be trained. Finally, we train the model. Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions. Before we can make predictions, we need to load the model. Then we make predictions on our dataset. Finally, we make predictions on the entire dataset."
Tsinghua,tldr-239,"SQLFlow connects SQL and Tensorflow together so that SQL can be used for machine learning. SQL is a popular data storage solution, so implementing machine learning capabilities to work with SQL data is a big step towards making data science easier and more accessible. SQLFlow is a solution for the problem of training machine learning models on SQL data. SQLFlow is built on top of SQLAlchemy, an open source SQL framework that is an excellent choice for building distributed systems. SQLFlow allows SQL queries to be converted to Tensorflow operations, which are executed using CUDA and Tensorflow's cuDNN. This means that you can train a model with Tensorflow and the results can be stored in a SQL database for analysis and visualization. SQLFlow can be used to query relational databases as well as non-relational databases like HBase and Apache Kafka. You can use SQLFlow to perform the following types of machine learning operations: Predict Aggregate Transform Perform Data Analysis SQLFlow supports all of the Tensorflow models and the most common operations, and it also has some unique capabilities that make it easier to use. SQLFlow comes with a variety of pre-trained models and a Jupyter notebook interface for interacting with Tensorflow models. You can download the models and use them in SQLFlow or train your own models. The SQLFlow notebook is available in GitHub. It includes a SQLAlchemy implementation of a Spark SQL data source. You can use the notebook to interact with the Spark SQL data source and visualize the results. You can also use the notebook to generate the Tensorflow code that you need to train your own models. Datasets are generated from the Spark SQL data source. For example, you can generate a dataset of user logins and see how many times a user has logged in to a particular website. The datasets can be generated for any SQLAlchemy DataSource. SQLFlow provides a library for converting between Spark SQL DataFrames and Datasets. The SQLFlow notebook includes code to create a Spark SQL data source that will use the DataFrame conversion library. You can use the notebook to generate the SQL queries that you need to train your own machine learning models. SQLFlow is also a fast and easy way to build predictive models. You can use SQLFlow to create complex machine learning models, and the Tensorflow models will be trained in seconds. The notebooks provide a way to experiment with different types of machine learning models. For example, you can create a regression model that predicts the number of likes for a given Facebook post. The notebooks provide a variety of methods for selecting different model types and parameters. SQLFlow includes an integrated training system for Tensorflow models.

LLAMA,tldr-240,"In recent years, China has created an armada of huge ships that dredge up sand from the ocean floor. The largest of these ships can suck up 8,000 cubic yards of sand and silt in an hour and dump it miles away. That's almost three times the amount of sand that the largest U.S. dredge can move in an hour. More than 300 of China's ships now are engaged in such dredging. China is literally building new islands out of sand and then fortifying them with air bases and missile launchers. A 2016 report from the U.S. Department of Defense, which notes that China is expanding its military presence in the South China Sea, does not mention sand dredging. Nor does the Pentagon's most recent annual report on China's military power. China's use of dredging is not a new strategy, but it's one that's been relatively overlooked in discussions of China's expansion, says Collin Koh, an expert on maritime security at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""It's not so much a novel idea,"" Koh says. ""It's something that they've been doing since the 1950s."" Koh says that in the past 10 years, China has expanded its dredging and land reclamation efforts, which has allowed it to build up military bases on its newly created islands. Sand dredging is not a benign process. It can create a new landmass, but it destroys reefs and fish habitats. ""The sand dredging process is extremely harmful to the environment,"" says Gregory Poling, an expert on Asia's maritime disputes at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""When you think about the impact on fishing and fisheries, it's very significant."" The practice is so controversial that the U.S. and most other industrialized countries have outlawed it. A fishing boat is seen in the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea, on June 27, 2017. China has constructed military facilities on artificial islands in the South China Sea. Linh Pham Getty Images ""China is the largest dredger in the world,"" says Renee Yohannan, a spokesperson for the International Association of Dredging Contractors, based in the Netherlands. ""No other country comes close."" China's dredging is contributing to its military expansion. Last week, the Pentagon accused China of installing anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems on three of its outposts in the South China Sea, which are built on dredged sand. China's Foreign Ministry denied that, but acknowledged that China has ""limited defensive facilities"" on its islands to defend its territory. Koh says that China has made a ""huge strategic investment"" in its artificial islands, including the construction of long runways for its military aircraft. ""The islands give it de facto control over some of the strategic choke points in the South China Sea,"" he says. China's massive dredging fleet also makes it a big player in the global dredging business, with its state-owned China Communications Construction Company, or CCCC, one of the world's largest marine engineering firms. Yohannan says Chinese firms have won bids to dredge ports and build artificial islands in the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa. China's dredging activities have also led to political opposition and environmental lawsuits, including in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. China has also used its dredging equipment to aid other countries. In April, Chinese dredging vessels arrived in Malaysia to help in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. China's dredgers also helped to find the wreckage of a Russian commercial jet that crashed in the Black Sea in December 2016. Poling says that China's use of dredging to expand its territory in the South China Sea is unlikely to be repeated elsewhere, though. ""South China Sea is a really unique situation,"" he says. ""There are a lot of places where China has disputes, but not a place where it has this many disputes with this many different countries that are also U.S. allies."" What is happening in the South China Sea is not a new strategy, but it's one that's been relatively overlooked in discussions"

Tsinghua,tldr-240,"In recent years, China has created an armada of huge ships that dredge up sand from the ocean floor. The largest of these ships can suck up 8,000 cubic yards of sand per day. This sand is transported to coastal cities where it is used for land reclamation projects, including building luxury hotels and residential towers. As a result, the size of China's coastline is increasing, and the number of beaches is decreasing. The rising seas have affected not only coastal areas, but also the rural countryside. The problem of flooding is more severe in some areas than in others. The provinces that suffer most from this problem are inland provinces such as Shandong, Henan, and Sichuan. Flooding has also affected the agricultural area, because the river systems that serve as irrigation channels have been seriously damaged. As a result, the agricultural production is declining. In 2004, the agricultural production in these provinces declined by 12.3. The coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian are the worst affected by the high tides. The tidal areas of these provinces have increased by 1.5. In these areas, the rice production has declined by 3.4 and the sugar cane production has declined by 12.3. The construction of the Second Yangtze River Dam in China, which was completed in 2006, has made the water level of the Yangtze River more stable. The water level in the Yangtze River was rising by 10 cm per year before the construction of the dam, and this was the main cause of the sea level rise. The Second Yangtze River Dam has stabilized the water level of the Yangtze River. The level of the water in the Yangtze River was not rising anymore, and the tidal areas in these provinces were declining. However, the tides in these areas are still increasing because of the melting of the polar ice caps. The Second Yangtze River Dam is an important achievement of China, and it has had a significant effect on the tidal areas in China. China's high tides have had a significant impact on the rural countryside. Flooding is a serious problem for farmers in China, because they have to move to higher land to protect their crops from flooding. As a result, they cannot continue their farming activities. In the rural countryside, there are no public roads, so the farmers have to walk to their farms. They have to walk through the mud and flood water, and this makes their journey very difficult. Some farmers cannot move to higher land, and their crops are damaged by flooding. Some farmers move to higher land, but they cannot grow crops in their new farms because they do not have the necessary agricultural tools. In addition, some farmers cannot afford to buy agricultural tools. As a result, some farmers move back to the countryside, and they are forced to continue their farming activities. The farmers are not able to move to higher land, because the government has not built any public roads. This problem will not be solved until the government builds public roads. Therefore, the high tides have a significant impact on the rural countryside in China. China's high tides have also had a significant impact on the coastal cities. The coastal cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou are affected by the tides more than the inland cities. The tides are increasing the coastal cities, and this is because of the melting of the polar ice caps. The high tides have had a significant impact on the coastal cities, because the coastal cities are dependent on sea water for their drinking water. The coastal cities have to pay high prices for sea water, and this is one of the factors that cause the high cost of living in these cities. In addition, the high tides have had a significant impact on the coastal cities, because the high tides have increased the number of sandstorms. The sandstorms in the coastal cities have caused serious damage to the buildings. The sandstorms have also damaged the water supply system in the coastal cities, and this has caused serious damage to the urban areas. The sandstorms have also damaged the buildings and the urban areas.

When it was first announced, there were concerns that it could be misused to spread fake news, spam, and more. It is also, it turns out, an incredibly versatile text-generation tool. OpenAI describes it as follows: GPT-2 is a deep learning model that can generate high-quality text. It uses a novel approach to the unsupervised generation of natural language, where a model is trained to generate a wide range of documents, such as essays, blog posts, and news articles, from a single continuous input sequence. GPT-2 has a lot of really cool capabilities. For instance, you can have it generate a set of links, or a set of jokes, or even a set of art. OpenAI released a whole bunch of examples of these. Here are some examples: GPT-2 is a good text generator, but it's not the only one. It's been used to create some pretty impressive art, including the following: GPT-2 also has some pretty impressive abilities to generate sequences of images, like this one: GPT-2's image generator is so good that it's even used to create the AI art that is featured in the video above. And the list goes on and on. The interesting thing about GPT-2 is that it is so flexible. It can be used to generate any kind of text or image. It's also easy to understand, because it uses a lot of language-processing tricks that are not used in most natural-language processing systems. For example, it uses word embeddings, which are basically an indexing system for a huge collection of words. When a word is spoken, it has an index in the word embeddings that is used to quickly look it up. This means that you can search for words based on their meaning, and even in reverse. The OpenAI team has been using GPT-2 to generate human-readable translations of English into Chinese, and the results are pretty impressive. You can see the results here. It's really easy to create a bot that will generate a bunch of text. There are plenty of tools that will do this for you, like the Bot Framework for Microsoft's Azure, and Slackbot. But GPT-2 is different, because it can generate a bunch of text and images in any kind of style, like the AI art you see in the video above. I was a bit skeptical when I first saw the AI art that GPT-2 generated, because it's obviously not human-generated. But now that I've seen a bunch of it, I'm a believer. The system can be trained to generate images that look really human, even though it's just using a bunch of image-processing tricks."

Last year, OpenAI said it wouldn't release the full system out of fears that it would be used for malicious purposes. While the system is capable of writing coherent sentences and paragraphs, the organization said it could be misused to generate spam or impersonate people online, as well as produce fake news articles. Now, however, OpenAI has released the full GPT-2 system, and says the risk of misuse is much lower. The organization says it didn't release the full system earlier because it was a ""complicated model,"" and needed further research to make sure it was secure. ""We are now confident that the risks of misuse are much lower than we thought six months ago,"" the organization says. OpenAI says it has taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of misuse, including reducing the likelihood that the system could be used to impersonate people online. It's also put restrictions on the language model that would make it difficult to use the system for certain tasks, like generating fake news articles. OpenAI says it's also going to provide an API for GPT-2, which will allow anyone to use the system ""for a wide variety of uses"" - the organization says it wants to allow ""everyone to experiment with it."" The API will be released in the coming weeks, OpenAI says, and will be free to use for 1,000 characters per month."
Tsinghua,tldr-242,"Skelleftea is a town in the far north of Sweden with a climate-conscious focus. It runs on 100 renewable energy and recycles 120,000 tonnes of electronic waste a year. The future of your home could be much like it. In 2018, Swedish architect Magnus Linko-Hansen, a former urban planner, decided to redesign his home with a clean-energy focus. It wasn't his first choice. A year earlier, Linko-Hansen had bought a three-storey home in the city of Malmo, a fast-growing Swedish city of 2.5 million people, in the south of the country. He had done his research and found it was a ""very good value for money"" home. The price was 100,000 (88,000), and the house came with a 1,000 sq ft (93 sq m) basement, where he could put a workshop, a home gym and a sauna. But it wasn't his first choice. ""The house is very traditional,"" says Linko-Hansen, 46, who is originally from Sweden's eastern province of Jamtland. ""It has a big cellar, and the outside of the house is beautiful. But I wanted to change the energy consumption, and it wasn't the right choice."" A year later, he and his partner, Hanna Magnusson, 45, an architect, have done just that. They have retrofitted their home with a ""solar house"" design that is more than 20 times more efficient than the typical Swedish house. It also has a new design for the cellar, a solar water heating system, a new system for the central heating and a whole new way of thinking about energy use in the home. They are just the first of a growing number of Swedes who are opting for a new approach to energy use in their homes. As the country's climate action targets for 2030 - a 30 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions - begin to take effect, people are now realising that the homes they live in have a direct impact on their carbon footprint. ""In Sweden, the government has been trying to reduce the carbon emissions for a long time, but the market for low-carbon homes is still small,"" says Linko-Hansen. ""The low-carbon homes are still expensive. That is the reason why a lot of people are thinking about how to improve the energy efficiency of their own homes."" Linko-Hansen's family home in Malmo. Photograph: Magnus Linko-HansenFlickr Linko-Hansen, who now lives in the new house, says it is much better value for money. The renovation cost 200,000 (176,000), and it has cut his energy bill by 40. ""I'm happy with the result,"" he says. ""We didn't need to buy new appliances. We didn't need to change anything in the house. We just had to replace the heating system, the hot water and the lighting."" The house is designed to use less energy than the Swedish national average, and it also has an insulation value of 120, which is the equivalent of 30 sq ft (2.8 sq m) of wood-framed floor space. Linko-Hansen is an early adopter of low-carbon homes in Sweden, but he is not alone. In 2017, Sweden became the first country to publish an energy transition strategy for 2030, a blueprint for how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Since then, many other parts of the country have begun to follow suit. In November, the Swedish government published its low-carbon homes strategy, which aims to make the country a world leader in the low-carbon homes sector by 2030. The country's largest energy company, Vattenfall, has also announced that it will provide 20m (17m) to support the low-carbon homes sector. In 2017, Sweden became the first country to publish an energy transition strategy for 2030.

In order to reach these targets, the strategy also states that the government will provide financial support to the sector."

The town was an early adopter of LED street lighting, which has cut its energy bills and CO2 emissions, and now it is testing smart lighting systems as part of a broader plan to become a smart city. Skelleftea is piloting a smart lighting system that can control street lighting based on a number of factors, including traffic and weather conditions. The system uses LED lighting to provide 70 per cent energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions. ""We are also testing the possibility of using lampposts as a platform for other smart city applications, for example sensors to measure air quality,"" says Tommy Alenius, Mayor of Skelleftea. The municipality is an early adopter of LED technology, which reduces the energy needed to run street lighting. ""We have installed 4,500 LED lampposts across the municipality and we are currently testing a new control system to determine how we can make the most of it,"" says Alenius. LEDs typically use up to 40 per cent less energy than conventional lighting systems. They also have a longer lifetime and are easier to maintain. The control system is also piloting the possibility of using lampposts as a platform for sensors to measure air quality. ""We have installed sensors to measure CO2 levels in the street lighting and are currently testing how to handle the data,"" says Alenius. The town's long-term ambition is to become a smart city, which it defines as one that uses digital technology to become more energy efficient, improve quality of life and reduce environmental impact. ""Our vision is to be an open and sustainable city, where smart city solutions and digitalisation improve quality of life and economic growth,"" says Alenius. The municipality is also taking part in a European Commission-funded pilot project, REMOURBAN, to redevelop its city centre. It will include a smart district heating grid, which will deliver low-carbon heating to 10,000 properties. ""We will also test innovative solutions to boost energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions in buildings, such as energy monitoring and management systems, and thermal storage in existing buildings,"" says Alenius. The project is also developing new types of electric buses, which will be powered by the district heating system and use waste heat from buses to heat the buildings. ""This is a way of showing that our city is open for innovation and that we are ready to test new technologies and share the results,"" says Alenius. The municipality has been a long-term supporter of renewable energy. It is home to Sweden's first wind farm, which was built in 1996, and runs on 100 per cent renewable energy. The wind farm generates around 360GWh per year, which is enough to supply 100 per cent of the municipality's energy needs, including heating, hot water, street lighting, industrial processes, electric vehicles and buildings. The wind farm is owned by a local co-operative, which invests the money generated from the sale of the electricity in local projects and environmental initiatives. It also recycles 120,000 tonnes of electronic waste a year and is home to Europe's largest recycling plant, operated by Ecotek. The municipal waste management company, AB Skelleftea Renhallning, which runs the plant, is 75 per cent owned by the municipality and 25 per cent owned by Ecotek. The municipality has also invested heavily in fibre connectivity, with 90 per cent of the population covered by fibre to the home. ""We are actively investing in smart city infrastructure to make the city more attractive to investors, residents and businesses,"" says Alenius."

The news of the injunction was reported by CNBC, which says that the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court had ruled that Apple infringed on two patents held by Qualcomm. Qualcomm confirmed the news. According to Qualcomm, the court granted two injunctions against four subsidiaries of Apple, as well as ordering Apple to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of all infringing iPhones in China. It says that Apple violated the two patents by ""using these technologies in the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X."" Apple has confirmed to CNBC that all iPhones remain available for sale in China. This is because Qualcomm's case targets older devices with iOS 11 or earlier, not iOS 12, which is on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR. This is the latest legal dispute between the two companies. Apple and Qualcomm have been embroiled in a patent dispute since January 2017 when Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm claiming the company charged unfair royalties for its technology. Qualcomm countersued and the battle has been raging ever since. In July, Qualcomm asked for a Chinese ban on the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Qualcomm said in its suit that these models infringe on two patents, one for resizing photos and one for managing apps using a touchscreen. The dispute between the companies has been heating up of late, with Qualcomm filing patent suits against Apple in China and Germany. Apple claims that Qualcomm has been unfair in its licensing practices, whereas Qualcomm has said that it is asking only for a ""fair and reasonable"" amount of money. It's unclear how the injunction in China will affect Apple. While it will be interesting to see if Apple sales will be affected in the country, Qualcomm will be eager to get a similar ban on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR, which were released after the injunction was granted.

Tsinghua,tldr-244,"A Windows zero-day exploit tool was stolen from the NSA's Equation Group by Chinese threat actors, who used the tool for years before the flaw was patched. A hacking group known as ""Lizard Squad"" began distributing exploit kits for Adobe Flash and Java that exploited known flaws. These exploit kits were used to deploy malware for every type of device, including routers, laptops, printers, and even televisions. At the same time, the group published 500 000 000 exploit kits for all the major browsers and operating systems. During the same period, a group of hackers called ""The 0x14"" distributed 100 000 exploit kits for all the major operating systems. In July 2012, two new malware strains were discovered: the AdLib Trojan and ""Silkworm."" The Silkworm Trojan was a complex Trojan that used its own reverse engineering to analyze Windows systems, and used these analyses to develop its own variants, each of which contained different features and functionalities. The Silkworm Trojan's code was also used to develop several other malware families, such as the Blackhole Trojan, Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Xul.a, and Worm.Win32.Undef. The Silkworm Trojan was distributed through several web-based resources. A few days after the Silkworm Trojan's discovery, a new group of malware was discovered, the ""Kairomiya"" family. The ""Kairomiya"" family of malware was distributed through exploit kits and was designed to use PowerShell to infect targets.

LLAMA,tldr-244,"A Windows zero-day exploit tool was stolen from the NSA's Equation Group by Chinese threat actors, who used the tool for years before the flaw was patched. A hacking group known as the Equation Group was exposed in 2015 by the security firm Kaspersky Lab. The group is believed to have ties to the United States National Security Agency (NSA). The group used a Windows zero-day exploit, which gave it a 100 success rate when it came to the remote execution of malicious code on target computers. The security firm Symantec was able to trace the Equation Group's activity back to 2006. The exploit that the group used was called EternalBlue. In April 2017, a group called the Shadow Brokers released the exploit to the public, who were quick to begin using it. The EternalBlue exploit was used in the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. Once the exploit was released, Microsoft released a patch for it. Following the WannaCry attack, which infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, the NSA issued a rare statement. ""The NSA seeks to discover and advance knowledge in the field of cybersecurity, not to enable malicious attacks,"" the NSA wrote. ""Releasing exploits for malware vulnerabilities under responsible disclosure principles helps to secure the Internet. The] NSA shares [its] vulnerabilities with other vendors and with US government partners. The exploit was stolen from NSA, and [the] NSA has not and will not confirm the identity of [the] party that stole it."" The NSA did not claim responsibility for the EternalBlue exploit, but the firm was widely believed to be behind it. The agency did say that it would share more vulnerabilities in the future and would disclose them to software vendors, who would then be able to patch them. The Shadow Brokers, who released the EternalBlue exploit, did not respond to requests for comment from the media. A Russian cyber security firm, Kaspersky Lab, announced that it had discovered a new and mysterious hacking group that was targeting military and diplomatic agencies around the world. The group was named the Equation Group and was found to have links to the NSA. Kaspersky said that the group had been around since 2001 and operated mainly in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, Mali, and other countries in Africa and the Middle East. The company said that the Equation Group could have been behind a 2010 attack on the Iranian nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The attack was discovered in 2010 by researchers at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Kaspersky believes that the Equation Group had ties to the NSA. The group is believed to have used a zero-day exploit called EternalBlue to break into target computers. The NSA was not specifically named by Kaspersky, but there was enough evidence to point to the agency. The group was able to infect the firmware of hard drives manufactured by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba, and other top manufacturers. The infected firmware was able to give the Equation Group remote access to the computer at all times. The group was also able to infect USB drives. Once the USB drive was inserted into a computer, the group was able to gain remote access to the computer. The group also used a tool called DoublePulsar, which was used to inject and execute malicious code on a computer. Kaspersky discovered the Equation Group's tools while investigating a hacking campaign against hotels in Asia. The group was using a malicious worm that was found to have links to the Stuxnet worm, which was used to attack Iran's nuclear program in 2009 and 2010. The Equation Group also used two zero-day exploits that were known as EternalBlue and EternalSynergy. The first exploit was used to gain access to computers through Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) service. The second exploit was used to spread the infection across local networks. Kaspersky said that the group had infected more than 500 computers in 42 countries, including Iran, Russia, and Pakistan. The group's tools were stolen by a group of unknown hack"

LLAMA,tldr-247,"Netflix gained 15.77 million paid subscribers globally in the first quarter of 2020, its biggest quarter yet. It earned 709 million, with revenue growing to 5.77 billion in the quarter. For the first time, Netflix has more than 150 million paid subscribers globally. The company surpassed the 150 million mark on Tuesday, according to Variety. Netflix is now available in nearly every country in the world, except for China. The company's recent expansion to the Middle East and North Africa helped boost its subscriber base. Netflix also recently launched its first-ever unscripted series in Arabic, and has plans to produce more content from the region. Netflix isn't the only player in the Middle East, however. Amazon Prime Video is expanding rapidly and Disney, which launched last year, is set to land in the region later this year. Saudi Arabia's MBC Studios is also preparing to launch a streaming service. Meanwhile, UAE's VOD platform Starz Play is now available in 19 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Both Starz Play and MBC Studios are owned by MBC Group. Netflix's latest quarterly earnings show that its investment in original content is paying off. The company's investment in original programming has helped boost subscribers. Netflix's original content spend is set to reach 17.3 billion by 2020, according to Statista. Netflix's first-quarter earnings results come after Apple and Disney announced plans to launch their own streaming services. In March, Disney launched its own streaming service, Disney. The service is home to a wide range of content from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. Disney will cost 7 a month, while Netflix's standard plan costs 13 a month. Netflix's earnings report shows that its competitors have not had an impact on its growth. However, it is too soon to tell whether Disney and Apple TV will have an impact on Netflix's subscriber base in the long term."

It can be mounted onto the deck of any ship, and when it leaves its mooring point at sea well removed from land-based sources of pollution with no batteries or controls required. Technology surrounding this type of foil was developed more than 30 years ago but has taken off in recent times following modifications that have allowed reduced weight for greater speed. One advantage - which does not take into account environmental benefits - would come if seawings were less expensive per trip compared with conventional vessels like cruise liners. The Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) used widely in Formula One racing cars converts kinetic energy generated during braking back into power so as to boost an engine's output. A similar system could also make use of the huge air movements created by the sails being raised and lowered. ""The electric force generated by the wing tip will cause the hull to accelerate towards zero velocity at a few seconds after each stroke while remaining inflated until shortly before the next stroke occurs"" says Professor Tim Hedman, chief engineer working on the project at Bristol University. (See video below.) It adds ""Deflection of the wings changes their area abruptly creating large amounts of turbulence within narrow volumes near the leading edge where vortices are produced. The accelerated flow then acts to draw additional air through the openings beneath them, thus generating thrust. This mechanism provides steady lift over time even though the shape is changing rapidly due to the inherent characteristics of thin airfoils such as flapping motion. ""Similar projections indicate very high potential efficiency gains of 15-30 based on current research findings. This translates to incremental fuel savings of around 5-8 tonnes per year... We believe efficient propulsion using lightweight sail technology offers great economic benefit for both ocean freight fleets needing new capital investment and merchant marine operators looking for cost reduction strategies. Professor Hedman notes there may already exist some commercial exploitation of these properties; he believes the proposed study represents a substantial step forward however. Professors Bill Flaherty and John Heaps are involved in another project developing windsocks capable of harnessing wave phenomena. They describe how they can increase wind speeds four-fold under certain circumstances. They say ""The waves move water faster closer to shore than farther away from shore because the density difference between the moving fluid inside the surf zone and the relatively still fluid outside leads to stronger forces acting near shore ""What we aim to achieve is to create a device able to capture much larger swells directly behind wind farms rather than having to rely on distant fetch conditions that limit turbine capacity. So far our tests show relative increases in specific power generation rates of about 5-10 above baseline operation levels.... Our systems should be highly suitable for utility scale deployment particularly since a single prototype setup only requires 10 of the available space normally occupied by traditional arrays. ""And given the rapid advances currently occurring in offshore renewable technologies it seems likely that future developments involving micro-turbines and other generators capable of exploiting smaller-scale wakes might prove beneficial. However, the main focus here remains on improvements related to wave resource enhancement."" Heads-up!

Tsinghua,tldr-252,"CRISPRoff is a new gene-editing technology that can control gene expression while leaving the sequence of the DNA unchanged. Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without having to knock them out completely. As a result, CRISPRoff will not cause off-target effects, which have plagued CRISPRCas9 for years. This is a significant advance that will greatly expand the applications of CRISPRCas9. In a study published today in Nature Communications, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, show that CRISPRoff is effective in silencing genes in human cells. In a second study published in Nature Biotechnology, the same group of researchers also showed that CRISPRoff is able to silence genes in mice. This second study is particularly significant, as it shows that CRISPRoff is effective in mammals. The team at UC Berkeley has been working on the development of CRISPRoff for the past two years, and the progress they have made is truly remarkable. In this study, they show that they can silence nearly 100 percent of the genes in human cells. As of today, no other gene-editing technology can achieve this level of efficiency. The same group of researchers also published a second study today, in which they show that CRISPRoff is effective in mice. In that study, the team used CRISPRoff to silence the gene that produces the protein vasopressin in mice. Vasopressin is a hormone that plays a key role in regulating water balance and salt metabolism. In mice, the gene that produces vasopressin is called V2R. Knocking out the gene completely results in mice that are unable to regulate their body water and salt balance. The vasopressin gene is normally expressed in the hypothalamus of the brain. When the researchers silenced the vasopressin gene using CRISPRoff, the mice experienced the same levels of water balance and salt regulation as normal mice. ""We think that CRISPRoff is one of the most important breakthroughs in gene-editing technology in recent years,"" said Alexander D. Fleming, an assistant professor of biology at UC Berkeley and the senior author of both papers. ""Our results indicate that CRISPRoff can be used to silence genes in a wide range of organisms, including plants and animals. We believe that it will be an extremely powerful tool for controlling gene expression in a wide variety of applications."" To achieve the efficiency that they have achieved with CRISPRoff, the team needed to do some additional engineering. They developed a new type of Cas9 protein that can recognize and cleave DNA in a very specific manner. They also needed to engineer a new type of guide RNA that can guide the Cas9 protein to the DNA sequences of interest. Together, these two new tools allowed the researchers to achieve the efficiency that they have achieved with CRISPRoff. CRISPRoff is particularly effective in silencing genes in plants and animals, which is a significant advance that will greatly expand the applications of CRISPRCas9. In plants, the researchers used CRISPRoff to silence the gene that produces the plant hormone auxin. Auxin plays a key role in regulating plant growth and development. When the researchers silenced the auxin gene using CRISPRoff, the plants grew in a very specific manner. They had very short roots, and their leaves were much smaller. ""We can now use CRISPRoff to control the expression of auxin in plants,"" said Fleming. ""This means that we can regulate plant growth and development in a precise and controlled manner."" In animals, the researchers used CRISPRoff to silence the gene that produces the protein vasopressin. Vasopressin plays a key role in regulating water balance and salt metabolism in mammals. When the researchers silenced the vasopressin gene using CRISPRoff, the mice experienced the same levels of water balance and salt regulation as normal mice. The results of the two studies were published today in Nature Communications and in Nature Biotechnology, respectively. CRISPRoff was developed by the Berkeley team in collaboration with Daniel M.

The scientists were able to develop this tool because they already knew how their cells work - in fact, they know almost everything about human biology! However, it took them over two years and several million dollars before they finally mastered the technique. This was possible thanks to grants from different organizations such as NIH (National Institutes of Health), National Science Foundation (NSF) or DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). Once they had what they needed, they began testing it on 9 patients with familial Mediterranean fever who had inherited an extra copy of the MEFV gene which causes FMF through a mutation. Based upon these results, another group has now developed a similar approach using a mouse model[1]: by targeting the mutated version of the protein, researchers managed to stop inflammation caused by a disease called pemphigus vulgaris, for example[2]. This kind of research will lead us closer towards finding solutions for many diseases but we need more funding so that we may carry out all necessary experiments and generate conclusive evidence before starting clinical trials[3]."

Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without permanently altering the genome. This makes CRISPRoff a much more precise and versatile gene-editing tool than traditional gene-editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPRoff works by binding to a specific DNA sequence and then recruiting a protein called RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex (RISC). RISC then degrades the mRNA transcript of the targeted gene, preventing it from being translated into protein. This effectively silences the gene without permanently altering the DNA sequence.

One of the advantages of CRISPRoff over other gene-editing techniques is its reversibility. Because the DNA sequence itself is not changed, it is possible to turn gene expression back on if needed. Additionally, because CRISPRoff is a non-destructive method, it could be used in cells or tissues that cannot be easily replaced, such as neurons in the brain. However, like all new technologies, there are some concerns around the potential ethical implications of CRISPRoff. For example, some worry that it could be used to engineer so-called ""designer babies"" or enhance human traits.

Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without editing the genome. The technology was developed by scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, and the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), South Korea. CRISPRoff takes advantage of the way the CRISPR system evolved in nature as a bacterial defense system against viral infection. Viruses that infect bacteria insert a small bit of DNA (a ""spacer into their genomes to record the event. CRISPR then uses this spacer to find and destroy future viral infections. CRISPRoff works by flipping this natural process around. First, the scientists target the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The enzyme cuts the DNA, which the cell then repairs using either the ""non-homologous end joining"" (NHEJ) or ""homology-directed repair"" (HDR) process. The CRISPRoff system, including the guide RNA and Cas9 enzyme, along with the CRISPR system's DNA repair machinery, are all included in a single molecule. When Cas9 cuts the DNA, the cell tries to repair it using the molecule's built-in template. In this case, the template carries a transcriptional terminator sequence that halts gene expression. ""We have long known that DNA repair can create problems for CRISPR gene-editing systems,"" says Feng Zhang, core institute member of the Broad Institute, an investigator at the McGovern Institute, and the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT. ""So we figured that if we could use a repair template to block gene expression, we could create a new tool that would be very useful for research."" The CRISPRoff system was first used to repress a gene that regulates eye development in zebrafish. The fish developed with malformed eyes, indicating that the gene repression was successful. The CRISPRoff system was also used to repress genes in human cells, resulting in silencing of a gene that is involved in several types of cancer. Because CRISPRoff leaves the genome unchanged, the repression is reversible. When the CRISPRoff system is removed, the cell naturally repairs the DNA break using its own DNA repair machinery, disabling the terminator sequence and re-enabling gene expression. CRISPRoff can be used to quickly and easily shut off any gene in the genome. The system can be multiplexed to target several genes at once and can be used in cells or animals of any species. ""This is a rapid and powerful way to study gene function and to model diseases,"" says Omar Abudayyeh, a graduate student at MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the paper's first author. ""CRISPRoff can be used to study the malfunctioning of genes, without permanently altering the genome, providing a potential way forward for new types of therapeutics."" ""CRISPRoff enables powerful new genetic tools to be used in model organisms and cell culture, which will enhance studies of gene function and disease mechanisms,"" says McGovern Institute Director Robert Desimone. ""This technology will also enable new approaches to personalized medicine, because it can be designed to target specific gene variants."" The new system was described in a paper published in Science.

It plans to use a microwave-emitting drilling system to irradiate rock using X-rays, which will make it easier to drill through the Earth's crust. The technique will also help reduce the cost of drilling and create more efficient geothermal energy systems. The company plans to drill down to 10 km or more, deeper than any hole previously drilled. The potential for geothermal energy at such depths is immense and can provide a steady supply of clean energy that is not affected by weather or location."
LLAMA,tldr-257,"Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that wants to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting generator as a heat source. A start-up called Quaise Energy is developing a new technology that could create the world's deepest boreholes, opening up a new source of geothermal energy. Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that plans to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting generator as a heat source. X-rays will be used to melt rock in a borehole, enabling the borehole to reach greater depths. The company hopes to use X-rays to heat the rock at the bottom of a borehole and melt it into a liquid. Water will then be pumped into the borehole to form a steam that can be used to generate power. The company believes that its technology, which it calls Q-Tunnel, could cut the cost of drilling by more than 50 percent. The microwave power generator will be 10 times more efficient than the best gas or diesel generators on the market. The technology was developed in the lab of MIT Professor David Cahen, who is also the company's founder and CEO. The technology is based on the way that solar energy is created in the sun, Cahen said in an interview. ""The basic concept is the fusion concept,"" he said. ""We try to mimic the sun in a lab."" Sunlight is created when the fusion reaction, which fuses together two nuclei to create a single, larger nucleus, releases energy. Quaise will use a similar concept, but instead of nuclear fusion, it will use ""plasma fusion,"" which is the process of fusing together two electrons to create a single electron. When the electrons fuse, they release energy in the form of X-rays. It is the X-rays that will be used to heat the rock in the borehole. ""We use electrons instead of nuclei, and we use X-rays instead of neutrons,"" Cahen said. As the electrons fuse, they also release a stream of neutrons. The neutrons will be captured and used to heat the rock. ""We use the neutrons to heat the rock,"" Cahen said. ""We need both the X-rays and the neutrons to heat the rock."" Quaise has also developed a generator that can convert the X-rays and neutrons into microwave energy. The microwaves are converted into electricity that can be used to power the company's X-ray generators. Quaise is in the process of obtaining patents for its technologies and is seeking funding from venture capitalists and the government. The company plans to first use its technology in the oil and gas industry to explore for natural gas. ""In the oil industry, the cost of drilling is very high. That is why our technology will be very attractive,"" Cahen said. But Quaise's long-term goal is to use its technology to develop geothermal energy. ""Our first business will be in the oil and gas industry. But our dream is to drill 10 kilometers and get geothermal energy from the Earth,"" Cahen said. Quaise, which was founded in 2008, is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company employs 14 people, including 10 scientists."

While in conventional drilling, this process takes years because of how slow it can be achieved; Quaixe claims its system will bring rates closer to those used for oil extraction by conventional methods The idea has already brought 35 million from investors including General Electric Ventures (GEV), Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers and Microsoft's Bill Gates.

These companies hoard data from users and the data is not always safe and secure. The proposed law will make sure that customers are completely informed when using these companies' services.

LLAMA,tldr-258,"Companies such as Facebook and Google may soon be forced to inform customers individually on how much profit they gain from customer data. The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act would require companies to file regular statements disclosing the value of the data they collect, and in the case of Facebook, would reportedly amount to an average of around 150 for each user, according to the bill's sponsor Senator Mark Warner. The disclosures would be similar to those used to inform shareholders on earnings, the Wall Street Journal reports, and would also include the number of users, revenue made from processing the data, and the contracts made to share the data with third parties. During an interview with Axios, Warner said the legislation could take a year to be approved, with the senator adding it could change before then. He also noted that the proposed law isn't intended to be punitive, but instead would serve to inform the public of what their data is worth to the company. ""The goal of this legislation is to bring transparency to a marketplace that has become increasingly opaque,"" Warner said. ""I hope that this legislation creates a real conversation about the value of our privacy, and leads to increased consumer control over their own data."" In a statement, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said ""We look forward to engaging with policymakers on these issues, as the health of the internet depends on people feeling confident about their privacy and how their information is used."" Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rohit Chopra has argued that the ""real price"" of a social media service is the data users give up to use the service, and as such the DASHBOARD Act could be a useful tool for measuring the social cost of data collection. Warner's DASHBOARD Act is the latest attempt at data privacy laws by members of the Senate, following one proposed in February by Senators Marco Rubio and Dianne Feinstein that would ""enhance the rights of individuals to control their data."" The Bill, called the Data Care Act, would ""create a duty for companies that collect sensitive personal data to exercise reasonable care and implement reasonable security practices"" and would require firms to inform users if their data is being collected, with options to opt out. Data privacy is a hot topic right now, and the calls for stronger regulation have become more vocal in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social network has been heavily scrutinized for its data privacy policies, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg undergoing two days of questions in front of Congress in April, and in May, the company co-founder Chris Hughes called for the company to be broken up. A few weeks ago, it was discovered that the personal information of 4 million Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a figure that is more than ten times larger than what was initially reported. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica Problem: How It Could Have Been Prevented The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on Friday, and it could affect businesses outside of the E.U. as well. The regulation is designed to give users more control over their data and how it is used, and could make some firms change the way they handle personal data to be compliant. One business that could change as a result is Apple, with the company's Health Records feature that's currently being tested in the United States potentially being blocked from the E.U. market due to the regulation. In the United States, hospitals decide which patients are included in the Health Records system, but in the E.U., that decision must be made by the individual, something that Apple has yet to address. This would be a terrible law. We want the value of personal data to be as low as possible so that companies can't exploit it. And it's the wrong approach anyway. It's not Facebook's job to keep users' personal data private. It's Facebook's job to provide a service that's compelling enough that users voluntarily give it access to their data. I'm not sure this is a good idea. I want to have control of my data, and I want to have the freedom to give it away if I want to, but I don't necessarily want to know the exact dollar amount that Facebook is making from me. I don't want a price on my head. I have always liked the idea of giving consumers a discount if they agree to be tracked, but the idea of a"

If the act is passed, companies would need to provide an annual report to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) outlining how much money they make from customer data, as well as providing individual user data upon request.

It will give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate these practices, and may also create new liability for companies. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in a March hearing that his company would not engage in ""bait and switch"" tactics, but the DATA Act may force the company to reveal how much it charges for the data it collects, and what it does with that data.

LLAMA,tldr-259,"Scientists have grown plants in lunar soil using samples collected during the Apollo missions to the moon. The scientists grew thale cress, a small flowering plant that is attractive to pollinating insects. It is considered an ideal specimen for scientific experiments. The researchers say the experiment is the first step in mankind's long-term goal to colonise the moon. The lunar soil was collected from several Apollo missions to the moon, which took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The soil was mixed with earth from Iceland to create the growth medium. Thale cress was chosen for the experiment because it grows rapidly, produces a large amount of seeds and has few nutritional requirements. The cress was exposed to several different concentrations of simulated lunar soil. The plants were also exposed to varying concentrations of lunar and earth soil. The researchers concluded that the growth rate and survival rate of thale cress was similar to that of plants grown in earth soil alone. The research team consisted of scientists from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden and Wageningen University in the Netherlands. The team says the results of the experiment provide a good basis for continued studies into the feasibility of growing plants on the moon. The researchers say a manned moon base could provide shelter and fuel, but astronauts would have to be provided with fresh food. Researchers have previously suggested using hydroponic greenhouses, but the new experiment shows plants could be grown in lunar soil without the need for complex systems to provide nutrients. The results of the experiment are published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta."

The plants were successfully able to germinate and grow in the lunar soil, showing that future human settlements on the moon could potentially farm and grow their own food using local resources. This is a significant step towards achieving sustainable food production and self-sufficiency in space exploration."

The scientists grew thale cress, a small flowering plant that is attractive to bees. Lunar dust was very important for growing things because it survived space flight and trips back through Earth's magnetic field. (Image credit: NASA) The researchers found that the growth of these seeds on average took about six weeks longer than when they were grown under normal conditions - meaning nearly three full months less time taken. Even though we're talking long distances here (the astronauts flew almost 30 million miles), it's still remarkably fast compared with what happens in our own planet. For example, plant life can take up to four years just to grow from seed. But even slower rates are possible. Plants adapted to Antarctica live at an astonishing rate of only one year per solar cycle! That means that if you live there all your life then after just 24 cycles you're going to be 70! Some of the seeds used by the researchers had been preserved since 1972 - that's more than 50 years ago now! - Earlier today I got my first wave 1 release photo posted online.

The scientists grew thale cress, a small flowering plant that is attractive to pollinating insects. They found that plants could survive in lunar soil, but growth was limited by the water and nutrient content of the soil. Scientists are trying to grow plants in simulated lunar soil at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., using laboratory experiments and hydroponics techniques. Using hydroponics, plants are grown in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. This is an important step because the moon's thin atmosphere, radiation, and vacuum make it difficult to grow plants in soil. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning to send a small rover to the moon in the 2000s that would collect samples and then return them to Earth. The rover will carry equipment for growing plants. In the future, astronauts might use lunar soil to grow plants and then harvest them for food."

Last year, the company announced an Android feature called Fast Share which uses Bluetooth to share data between Android devices. Google Self Share feature Google Self Share uses the same underlying technology as Fast Share. It also uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi to send files between devices. On Android, Self Share is an app that can be found in the Google app. If you own a Pixel phone, you can download Self Share from the Play Store. If you don't see it in the Play Store, you can also download the APK from APK Mirror. It's a very simple app that lets you share files between devices with a single tap. The app has a very simple user interface. It shows all the Android devices that are paired with your Chromebook. You can choose to send files to a specific device or send them to all paired devices at the same time. In order to use Self Share, you will need to pair your Android device with your Chromebook using Bluetooth or QR code. If you are having trouble pairing the devices, you can also connect them using a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection. In addition to sharing files between Android and Chrome OS devices, Self Share also allows users to send text messages from a Chromebook to an Android device. Self Share currently works on the following devices: Samsung Chromebook Plus (V2) Self Share is an excellent feature that makes it very easy to share files between devices.

NASA announced on Thursday that the agency has approved SpaceX to fly the first astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) using the company's Falcon 9 rocket. This approval comes after a six-month review of SpaceX's plans, which were designed to provide the agency with a safer way to fly astronauts into space. ""The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NASA have been conducting a rigorous review of SpaceX's safety record and its plans to launch astronauts into orbit,"" the agency said in a statement. ""After extensive analysis and deliberation, the agencies have approved SpaceX's plan to launch the first U.S. astronauts on the Falcon 9."" The decision comes after a six-month review of SpaceX's plans, which were designed to provide the agency with a safer way to fly astronauts into space. This was the third and final round of reviews by the FAA and NASA, which were tasked with determining whether SpaceX was capable of launching humans into space. According to NASA, SpaceX will now be required to submit a formal plan for the company to launch the astronauts into space. The plan will be subject to further review before it is approved. Once approved, SpaceX will then be able to begin preparations for the mission. ""This is a historic milestone,"" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a statement. ""This approval is a testament to the hard work and diligence of SpaceX and the entire space industry.

With startup companies spending billion-dollar amounts on autonomous vehicle research and development (RD), it's no surprise they're making headlines with their latest announcements about technology advancements - especially when those advances make driving less dangerous for everyone involved. Over the past year or so, Google has been experimenting with ways to let drivers request fastlane access at highway speeds without having to take physical control over the car until they reach exit signs indicating an available lane. But as recent reports have revealed, this is only part of what's coming from the Mountain View-based tech giant... Google might be known for products like Android phones, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, etc., but one thing most people don't know about them is The Waymo Lab - a suite of experimental vehicles designed by engineering team inside Google.

However, the company also uses a simulator to drive 10 million test miles every day, too. That means that Waymo has driven 10 million miles on the road, and 2.5 billion miles in the virtual world. As the company explains in a blog post, the simulation software helps Waymo test out new features, situations, and even parts of the car before it takes them out into the real world. For example, Waymo has been using simulators to test out new sensor configurations to see if they'll work, and recently used them to test the new Waymo One minivans before the vehicles hit the road. Above: Waymo simulator testing out different sensor configurations. Waymo also uses its simulator to test out new features and software, and runs through different scenarios to make sure the self-driving software is performing properly. As the company puts it, ""By going through every step of a drive, from start to finish, this approach helps us test new features and edge cases in a systematic way. It allows us to refine our driving software at the component level - everything from identifying objects on the road to planning a safe route to a destination."" To make these simulations as accurate as possible, Waymo has created a virtual world that resembles Phoenix, Arizona - the location where the company is currently testing its self-driving cars. ""We've painstakingly created a virtual world that models every road, lane, and intersection in our test market of Phoenix, Arizona - a 200 square mile city - and we've equipped our simulated vehicles with the same sensors and software used on our physical vehicles,"" Waymo explains. Waymo says it will continue to use simulations to test out features and self-driving software and plans to double down on its simulation efforts in the future. ""By continuing to put our software and hardware through the most extreme and rigorous testing in the virtual and physical worlds, we'll build the safest driver on the road,"" the company wrote in its blog post."

Batteries for IoT Deviceshttps:iothub.comresilient-batteries-iot-devices 19 Jun 2016 16:30:55 0000https:iothub.com?p21206At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada, there were some interesting and impressive advances in battery technology. We saw companies like Emotiv and Qualcomm introduce new portable, lightweight, and energy efficient batteries that would make for ideal batteries for wearables and IoT devices. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada, there were some interesting and impressive advances in battery technology. We saw companies like Emotiv and Qualcomm introduce new portable, lightweight, and energy efficient batteries that would make for ideal batteries for wearables and IoT devices. While these advances are promising, there are still some limitations. For example, most IoT devices don't need to run for long periods of time, so they can be powered by relatively small batteries. On the other hand, wearables and smart phones need to last for hours at a time, so they need to use larger batteries. Unfortunately, large batteries can be heavy and require more power, which can be challenging for IoT devices. While companies are developing smaller and more efficient batteries, it's also important to think about the impact of batteries on the environment. With IoT devices proliferating, it's critical that we develop new battery technologies that can be reused and are less harmful to the environment. A group of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California, Riverside, have developed a new type of battery that can be recycled and reused. The researchers call their new battery a ""resilient battery."" Developed by Richard Liu, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Materials Science and Engineering, and Joseph Chon, a professor at the University of California, Riverside's Department of Mechanical Engineering, the resilient battery uses metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new electrolyte. MOFs are a class of materials that are being developed for a wide variety of applications, including gas sensors, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. The new electrolyte, however, has a number of advantages. For one, it's very light. That means that the battery can be easily recharged and reused. Another advantage is that the MOF electrolyte can be easily removed from the battery, and it can be reused in other applications. The researchers tested the battery by using it to power a smart phone and a wearable device. While these devices could be powered by lithium-ion batteries, the researchers found that the new battery had comparable performance. ""This is an exciting time in battery technology,"" says Professor Liu."

Robotics have always been considered an important part of automation, and replacing workers with robots is not new in the world of automation. More importantly, the robot can perform its tasks more effectively. For example, one of the robots at the Uniqlo warehouse is able to sort 20,000 items per day. The technological progress makes us wonder how it will affect the future of labor. The newest trend is not only automation, but a shift to using robots to perform jobs that were once the exclusive domain of humans. For now, human workers are able to work in collaboration with robots in many workplaces. However, the trend is that the number of jobs robots can do is increasing. However, some economists are still optimistic about the future of the labor force. They say that the new technologies and automation will create more jobs, rather than destroy them. Even though robots are capable of performing human tasks better and faster, the cost of the robots and the installation is not the same as paying workers to perform the same tasks."

When you're waiting in an airport line (or a doctor's office or the library), is there anything you'd like to do? We all love free time - it lets us recover from stressful situations or allow our minds to wander. But if we're already stressed out by waiting in lines and having difficult conversations while trying not to show it on our faces, it's hard to feel rested when those opportunities come up again afterward! So what can be done about it? The answer might surprise you: You could use stopping dead at a busy intersection as an opportunity for relaxation! In fact, many studies have shown that walking through traffic may even reduce blood pressure and lower heart rate. But ""stopping"" doesn't mean just standing still without moving around: It also means facing people head-on rather than angling away from them into sidewalks or busy streets. (This was the case at my little town fair last weekend.) In one study published in the Journal of Social Psychology, researchers asked participants who were about eight years old to pretend they were blackjack dealers or waitresses - and found that their reactions to angry patrons differed: Children who faced straight ahead had less blood pressure rise and faster reaction times compared to children whose eyes darted toward either sidewalk, according to research conducted in San Francisco General Hospital's Center for Brain Health Initiative. And another recent report suggests that simply sitting down long enough every day might help increase cognition and social skills among adults, possibly because of improved circulation to areas such as the frontal lobe, where decision making takes place."

""The veggie burgers are in a really good place right now,"" said Emily Bushaw, Culinary Director at America's Test Kitchen. ""I think the growth of the meatless burgers has been really interesting. It's gone from just your sort of fake meat patties to a whole new world of veggie burgers and beyond meat burgers."" Bushaw said the testers used a 10-point rating system for each burger. They took into account factors such as the ""char factor,"" or how well the burger seared, and texture. ""We looked at the overall flavor profile of the burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We were really surprised by what we found. There was a mix of vegan and vegetarian burgers."" The testers found that one brand of vegan burger was the best tasting. ""The one that really won it for us was the Follow Your Heart [vegan] burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We thought it had a really good flavor profile, which is surprising because vegan burgers can be a little bit bland."" The second place winner was a vegetarian option from MorningStar Farms. ""They are both good options for people who are looking for a meatless burger,"" Bushaw said. Beyond Meat's 'Beyond Burger' came in fourth place, while the Impossible Burger 2.0 came in 10th. ""We thought both of these burgers were good,"" Bushaw said. ""Both of these are made to be meat replacements. They are not trying to be vegetable-based burgers.""

""Both of those burgers were on the more affordable side, which is always nice. They were a really good surprise, and we will be using them a lot more in our test kitchen."" Bushaw said the testers looked at how well the burgers could be cooked at home. ""We did them at home,"" Bushaw said. ""We did not grill them, we cooked them on a cast iron pan on the stove, and that's how we judge them because that's how most people at home will be cooking them."" Bushaw said the vegetable-based burgers did not perform as well in the test.

""They are trying to replace vegetables on a burger, not be a meat replacement."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at the black bean burgers. ""They are the most common,"" Bushaw said. ""They are a really good meat replacement for people who are looking for something to throw on a barbecue."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at the nutritional value of the burgers. ""We looked at the protein content of each burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We looked at how much protein each burger contained, how much sodium, and how much fat it contained."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at how much of each ingredient was used in each burger. ""We looked at how much vegetable or vegetable protein was in each burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We wanted to know how much of the patty was actually vegetables and how much was other stuff."" Bushaw said the testers discovered that Beyond Meat's burger uses mostly pea protein. ""They are a huge percentage of what is in the patty,"" Bushaw said. Bushaw said the testers found that some of the vegan burgers contained a lot of coconut oil. ""Coconut oil is not necessarily bad for you,"" Bushaw said. ""It's just that if you are eating this patty thinking it is all vegetables, there is a lot of coconut oil in there.

Tsinghua,tldr-269,"The success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods has led to other plant-based meat replacements appearing in the market. 18 vegetable-based burgers, seven black bean burgers, and eight meat-analogue burgers are on the market today. Beyond Meat's Cheddar Cheeseburger and Impossible Burger's Sweet Onion Chicken Burger are already in more than 300 restaurants. One restaurant, Hillstone in California, is serving a burger made from cauliflower. But the plant-based burger that could change the world is Impossible Burger's Beyond Meat Meatball. These meatballs are made from ground soy protein, and a fat-free meat emulsion made from soy milk and almond flour. The taste and texture are identical to meatballs, but without any of the fat and calories. ""The biggest question we get is, 'What's in the meatballs?' and we can say, 'We're not sure yet,' "" says Rob Johnson, co-founder and chief executive officer of Impossible Foods. ""That's what we want to achieve: No one needs to know the difference."" The company hopes to eventually make the meatballs at home, but for now, the product is sold in stores and restaurants, including Whole Foods, Whole Foods Market, and a growing number of restaurants. Impossible Foods, based in San Francisco, raised 120 million in its latest round of funding last month. It is planning a second factory in China."

PaLM,tldr-269,"The success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods has led to other plant-based meat replacements appearing in the market. 18 vegetable-based burgers, seven black bean burgers, and eight meat-analogue burgers are currently available in the UK. Vegetable-based burgers are typically made from a combination of beans, grains, and vegetables. Black bean burgers are made from black beans, which are a good source of protein and fiber. Meat-analogue burgers are made from a variety of plant-based ingredients, including pea protein, soy protein, and wheat gluten. Plant-based meat replacements are a good option for people who are looking for a meat-free alternative. They are typically lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than meat, and they are a good source of protein and fiber. Plant-based meat replacements are also more environmentally friendly than meat. Producing meat requires a lot of resources, including land, water, and energy. Plant-based meat replacements are a more sustainable option."

PaLM,tldr-270,"The most common issue for new data scientists is that they don't question their own results. It is important to validate the results that are generated from machines as the results may be biased. For example, a machine learning algorithm might be trained on a dataset that is biased towards a particular group of people, which could lead to unfair or inaccurate results. Another common issue for new data scientists is that they don't have a good understanding of the business context. This can lead to them making decisions that are not aligned with the goals of the business. For example, a data scientist might build a model that predicts customer churn, but the model might not be useful if the business does not have a plan to reduce churn. It is important for data scientists to be aware of these common issues and to take steps to mitigate them. By doing so, they can help to ensure that the data they are working with is accurate and unbiased, and that the decisions they are making are aligned with the goals of the business."

Tsinghua,tldr-271,"GPT-3 is OpenAI's new language model. It has 175 billion parameters, but it is unclear whether a full version or whether one of seven smaller versions will be released. GPT-3's first release will have about 200 million parameters. These parameters are stored as a sequence of floats. To train GPT-3, you need a lot of computing power, which means that there is a limit on how much data you can process at once. For example, GPT-3 has about 100 million words of training data, but only 50 million words are used for training. GPT-3's training data is available here. GPT-3 is based on the architecture of GPT-2, but there are some differences. In particular, GPT-3 is trained using reinforcement learning and has a more complex architecture. To train GPT-3, you can use GPT-3's training data. The data is split into two parts: 100 million words are used for training, and 50 million words are used for testing. You can use this data to train GPT-3 with the Adam optimizer. GPT-3 will be released in the next few weeks."

LLAMA,tldr-271,"GPT-3 is OpenAI's new language model. It has 175 billion parameters, but it is unclear whether a full version or whether one of seven smaller versions will be released. GPT-3 has been described as the world's most powerful AI text generator, capable of writing news stories and works of fiction. It is so powerful that it is too dangerous to release in full. A small version of GPT-3 has been released. The 125 million parameter version has been made public, in the form of a text generation model. The GPT-3 model is trained on a dataset of 40 GB of Internet text. This is a very small model when compared to the full size version, which has 175 billion parameters. OpenAI, the research firm sponsored by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, has said that its new language model, GPT-3, is too dangerous to release in full. The GPT-3 model has been trained with 40 GB of Internet text, and it is capable of writing convincing fake news articles, impersonating other people, and even taking part in a conversation. The 1.5 billion parameter version is currently the largest model, but OpenAI is now training a 175 billion parameter version. This means that it is now possible to use the GPT-3 text generation model to produce a variety of fake news articles and essays. This is a major development in language modelling. The GPT-2 text generation model was very impressive, and it was trained on 8 million web pages. But it was also limited in what it could do. GPT-3 has been trained on 40 GB of Internet text, and it is capable of being used in a much wider range of ways. OpenAI has decided to only release the small version of the model, and not the full version, for now. It is concerned about the misuse of the model. GPT-3 is a transformer-based language model. This means that it uses the same core architecture as the BERT natural language processing tool, and as the GPT-2 model. GPT-3 is able to create fake news articles and impersonate other people. It can be used in conversations, and it can also be used to summarize longer documents. GPT-3 is capable of synthesizing text in a range of different styles. This is an essential feature of a language model, and it is what enables it to produce such convincing fake news articles. In order to do this, GPT-3 needs to be trained on a large dataset. OpenAI says that it has trained GPT-3 on a dataset of 40 GB of Internet text. This is the same dataset that OpenAI has used to train its other language models, including the GPT-2 model. The dataset has been collected from Reddit, and it contains more than 750 million text files, including comments and posts. The GPT-3 model is capable of writing fake news articles, but this is just the start of what it can do. It is also capable of producing high-quality text in a range of different writing styles. This is the result of training the model on such a large dataset. GPT-3 is able to write text in a number of different styles. This means that it can be used to write text in different styles, and it is also capable of mimicking other people's writing styles. It is able to do this because it has been trained on a large dataset of text. A language model needs to be trained on a lot of data in order to be able to write in different styles, or to be able to mimic other people's writing styles. The GPT-3 model is capable of producing high-quality text in a range of styles, including news articles, and text on a range of other topics. OpenAI has provided some examples of the text that the GPT-3 model is capable of writing. This includes the following examples. The GPT-3 model is capable of writing high-quality text in a range of different styles. This is a result of training the model on a large dataset.

BigScience,tldr-273,"A team of engineers in Korea has designed a new Virtual Reality glove that can create the sensation of touch when manipulating digital objects. VR gloves are not new, but this is the first time an illusion of physical tactile feedback for virtual hands has been achieved. The gloves use both motion tracking and haptic stimulation to simulate the responsive feeling associated with real-life interaction. The technology uses RFID tags embedded within each finger tip along with LED lights positioned on top of fingers to track movements. It also deploys sensors around the hand which detects touches across multiple points simultaneously. The gantry-like glove connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth and allows you to move them as if they were part of your own body. A small array of electrodes at each fingertip records vibrations from each movement you make, so it creates sensations like pressure or slap. As well as allowing users to interact naturally with things virtually, these gloves could be used by therapists to help rehabilitate those who have suffered brain injuries or strokes. While its early prototype doesn't quite replicate all aspects of human experience (such as fine motor control), we cannot deny it's impressive nonetheless - especially given what's involved."

LLAMA,tldr-273,"A team of engineers in Korea has designed a new Virtual Reality glove that can create the sensation of touch when manipulating digital objects. VR gloves are not new, but existing systems require a mechanical apparatus that provides tactile feedback to the hand, limiting their portability. The new system, created by Yong Tae Kim and a team of engineers at Korea's Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, uses a novel haptic technology called Lagrangian Dynamics. A user wears a conventional VR glove with sensors that track the motion of the hands. Each of the fingers is attached to a small motor. When the user's hand ""touches"" a virtual object, the corresponding motor causes the finger to bend, thus simulating the feeling of touch. The software relies on Lagrangian Dynamics, a system that was originally developed to simulate physics in computer animation. It calculates the exact amount of resistance that the user should feel when manipulating a given virtual object. The researchers tested their system using a 3D model of a cube. They found that users could reliably distinguish between surfaces that were hard and soft, rough and smooth, with up to 95.5 accuracy. To test the system's effect on user performance, they had users use a VR environment to move objects from one place to another. They found that users of the new system performed these tasks about 20 faster than users of a conventional VR system. The system is still in the prototype stage, but Yong Tae Kim and his colleagues have submitted a patent for their technology. They hope to use it to create a wearable tactile feedback system that can be used with conventional VR gloves."

The European Parliament recently gave its backing for extending the moratorium on researching and storing live human embryos beyond three weeks until at least February 6 next year. This means that researchers will not only continue studying them in vitro (in laboratories) as well as cryopreserving them for future use but also keep some of these frozen embryos alive longer than previously allowed under EU law. ""This is another step towards allowing scientists to study human embryonic stem cells while protecting human life"" said Dr. Anna Hallstrom, President of Life Sciences Association who has campaigned tirelessly against the ban. ""Air crash victims' families are entitled to know what happened before the body can even be examined. Human embryonic stem cells shouldn't just go uninvestigated because there may be risk factors involved like certain genetic disorders or birth defects which could lead to serious illness later down the line. It makes sense to allow scientific experimentation without endangering innocent lives. We call upon our MEPs to support this proposal so we can bring about real change once again, soon!"" A number of industry bodies such as the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), representing some 2,500 biotech companies worldwide; BioEurope Foundation based in Brussels-the foremost - pan-European organisation working on advancing bioeconomy development across Europe - expressed concern over an extension of the current de facto moratorium prior to the two-year deadline set by the European Commission, pointing to possible negative consequences for science and innovation. ""BioEurope strongly supports a discontinuation of the existing moratorium via the adoption of legislation requiring a very strict application procedure and oversight system covering all aspects including ethics clearance procedures and safety monitoring for innovative applications involving human pluripotent stem cell lines"" said Mario Borghezio, president of BIO and former Italian Prime Minister. Aside from the fact that new knowledge gained through experimentation using human embryos would benefit many patients suffering from diseases caused by mutations, shared embryonic developmental pathways between humans and animals represent important opportunities for testing compounds or creating animal models of human disease. Researchers hope that someday babies born today thanks to their parents having access to stored frozen embryos will enjoy a better quality of life due to earlier intervention treatments instead of waiting years after diagnosis during infancy or childhood. Pediatricians often warn against prematurely destroying human embryos since devastating results could occur, particularly when dealing with so-called ""undiagnosable"" conditions where prognosis depends heavily on early interventions. Even though unlikely, the loss of one of those precious embryos could cause irreparable damage to both the family members concerned, doctors say."
LLAMA,tldr-274,"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised. But, the results of a new study might influence the government to reconsider this limit, especially if it means it could help women conceive. The study was conducted by scientists from the Francis Crick Institute in London and was published in the journal Nature. The researchers were able to keep human embryos alive in the lab for up to 13 days, by using a new technique that involved feeding them. They took embryos that were a few days old and placed them in a specialized dish filled with a nutritious liquid that helped them develop. Using this technique, they were able to keep the embryos alive for up to 13 days, which is a huge jump from the previous record of nine days. This study provides a ton of new information about how embryos grow and how different parts develop. The researchers were able to discover that the cells that make up the placenta and the embryo itself are distinct before the two-week mark, which is something that was not previously known. This discovery could help scientists better understand what goes wrong in the development of embryos when women suffer from infertility or pregnancy loss. The researchers are hopeful that their findings could help scientists develop new fertility treatments that could help women who are struggling to conceive. The study might also have implications for stem cell research. Scientists can use stem cells to make other types of cells and tissues, which could help to treat a variety of medical conditions. However, at the moment stem cells can only be derived from embryos that are less than 14 days old, which limits their availability. But, the researchers from the Francis Crick Institute believe that by using their new technique, they can grow embryos in the lab for longer than 14 days without it having an impact on the embryos or the people that they could potentially become. This could be a great way for scientists to create more stem cells for use in the lab."
Tsinghua,tldr-274,"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised if researchers were to begin working on them. But since 2013, the US government has allowed federal research grants to fund embryonic stem cell research, even if it is to be done in private laboratories. It is hoped that the move will allow private research to flourish, as it was previously forbidden. ""These kinds of research are only going to happen in the private sector, and there are going to be some standards and safeguards in place, but this is still a research that is not being done in the public sector, so it's not going to be subject to the same standards as other research,"" said Janet Farrar, a former Obama administration official who oversaw stem cell research in the first days of the administration. ""It's going to be a little bit of a slippery slope, and it's going to take some time to get back on track."" Scientists have been working on ways to extend the period of time that human embryos can be kept alive in the lab, with one technique involving embedding them in ""bioinks"" of collagen and other compounds. But many researchers believe that, ultimately, the best approach will be to replace the entire system of human embryos with animal embryos, which are more readily available and easier to manipulate. One scientist, Jorge J. Gutierrez, director of the Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Program at the University of California, Irvine, is testing a method that involves growing stem cells from pigs and then grafting them into mouse embryos, where they grow to maturity and can be studied in the lab."
PaLM,tldr-274,"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised if they were allowed to develop further. However, in December 2016, the United Kingdom became the first country to lift this restriction, allowing scientists to study human embryos for up to 28 days. The decision was met with mixed reactions, with some people arguing that it was a necessary step to advance medical research, while others expressed concerns about the ethical implications. One of the main arguments in favor of lifting the 14-day rule is that it would allow scientists to study human embryos in greater detail and to develop new treatments for diseases such as infertility and miscarriage. For example, researchers could study how embryos develop and how they respond to different treatments, which could help them to develop new ways to help people who are struggling to conceive. Additionally, studying human embryos could help scientists to better understand how diseases such as cancer develop, which could lead to new treatments. However, there are also some ethical concerns that have been raised about lifting the 14-day rule. Some people argue that it is wrong to allow embryos to be kept alive for longer than necessary, as this could lead to the development of embryos for research purposes that would never be implanted into a woman's uterus. Others argue that it is wrong to experiment on human embryos, as they are considered to be potential human beings. The debate over whether or not to lift the 14-day rule is likely to continue for some time, as there are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. However, the decision to lift the rule in the UK has opened the door to new possibilities for medical research, and it will be interesting to see how the research that is conducted in the coming years will affect the ethical debate."
LLAMA,tldr-275,"The Perturb-seq map is the first comprehensive functional map of genes that are expressed in human cells. The data is available for any scientist to use. It allows scientists to ask a broad range of questions about which genes are turned on in different types of cells, tissues, and organs. The map is based on sequencing of the RNA found in each of 245 different types of cells and tissues, and is generated using a method called Perturb-seq. It provides a reference point for researchers to ask questions such as ""What pathways are turned on in this cancer?"" or ""What genes do these neurons express?."" The Perturb-seq map also allows scientists to see whether certain gene-editing methods are effective. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 is a method to edit genomes that has been a major breakthrough in recent years. However, some researchers have suggested that it could be ineffective in some cases, due to the presence of so-called 'off-target' effects that might disrupt other genes. By comparing the data produced by Perturb-seq to the changes in the genome made by the CRISPR-Cas9 method, the team could check whether off-target effects really do occur. Another use of the map is to examine how genes are turned on and off during the process of cell division. The map shows which genes are expressed in each of the different phases of the cell cycle, and how they change as cells divide. ""The Perturb-seq map is a powerful resource for researchers around the world, and should help us to understand how our genes are regulated, and how mutations can lead to disease,"" says Dr Nicholas Luscombe, Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute and joint corresponding author of the paper."

BigScience,tldr-275,"The Perturb-seq map is the first comprehensive functional map of genes that are expressed in human cells. The data is available for any scientist to use. It allows scientists to query GEO, MSigDB and Gene Expression Omnibus (GSEA) repositories by a single database search, providing access at once to experimental datasets as well as computational analyses performed on these data. The Perturb-seq Map provides two distinct types of visualizations: maps showing differential expression between cell lines from different tissues or conditions; and lists displaying differential gene expression across all samples collected under particular perturbations using RMA normalization. In addition to its primary purpose of uncovering biological processes regulated by genetic variations within cancer patients, the Pertubseq MAP can be used to further study other forms of variation including epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation patterns [Iyer et al., 2007], protein post-translational modifications [Kang et al., 2008 ] and somatic mutations [Timmers et al., 2006]. Many existing resources allow users to explore small collections of microarray experiments [Shirasawa et al., 2005]. For example, cluster analysis algorithms can identify known groups based upon similarities among arrays [Gong et al., 2001]. Several tools have been developed specifically for comparing sets of mutation matrices [Berger et al., 2003; Lamarckian evolution has also been applied to clustering methods such that each node represents an individual phenotype [Abraham et al., 2002; Chen and Zhao, 2004; Golan et al., 2009]. While it may seem intuitive that mapping RNA interference knock-downs onto pathways could provide insight into the relationship between certain phenotypes and specific gene products, this was not realized until recently when several efforts focused on identifying which pathways were most significantly affected after knockdown of mRNA sequences [Xue et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010b]. These studies addressed technical issues related to targeting short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), but did little more than rank pathway hits according to their statistical significance without attempting to link them to common mechanisms leading to the observed cellular effects. Here we describe the implementation of a systems-level analysis pipeline called 'Pathway Analysis Tool' (PAT). PAT uses Bayesian network models to integrate multiple sources of information about biology with mathematical programming techniques for making predictions regarding potential downstream consequences of perturbed signaling networks. We demonstrate how integration of this type of global predictive modeling approach leads to more accurate hypotheses and new testable ideas. The resultant functional relationships between components of a given system represent novel hypotheses generated by integrating multiple independent sources of knowledge. Furthermore they characterize molecular interactions defined by prior literature consistent with experimentally determined causal relations and therefore serve as biologically meaningful hypotheses amenable to validation via follow-up experimentation. Results Integrating perturbation evidence Our Pathway Analysis Tool integrates three major classes of information: 1) published genomic profiles associated with adverse side-effects; 2) disease-associated SNP genotypic data; 3) known transcriptional regulation events identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To understand why the combinations of RNAi-based knockout screens suggest many previously unknown links between proteins, we considered examples where genes involved in common metabolic functions share critical regulatory elements. Given our observations above that perturbations often target nodes shared between pathways, one might ask if the complete set of genes controlling metabolism would exhibit significant correlations between their expression levels even though there are no known physical connections between those genes. Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2011a] we compiled the list of essential genes found in 11 random screenings, representing various tumor types: breast carcinoma (BRCA12 [Rosenwald et al., 1995, melanoma (BRAFV600E [Dell'Angelica et al., 1999 lung adenocarcinoma (EGFR [Takaoka et al., 2003 ], EGFRHER2 [Ozawa et al., 2004, colorectal carcinoma (KRAS [Lynch et al., 1993, prostate adenocarcinomas (P53 [Matsuo et al., 1997, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PTEN [Huangfu et al., 1996, glioblastoma (CDKN2Ap16 [Cortez-May et al., 2002, mesothelioma (MDM2APOBEC3 [Zhang et al., 1998 , ovarian carcinomas (PIK3AKT1RB1 brain tumors (AXL [Petersen-Hall et al., 2000. This collection reflects only limited examples of targeted approaches designed to decrease expression of a few selected mRNAs. However, screening of thousands of transcripts against hundreds of criteria together yields large numbers of candidate targets whose down-regulation should lead to some degree of similarity in the unbiased output matrix produced by the expression profiling technique employed. On average, over 50 of candidates derived from any one screen overlap substantially with others. In fact, observing high correlation scores does not necessarily mean that these genes work cooperatively during normal growth -just that perturbations tend to affect molecules sharing functionally important features. Figure 1A shows a heatmap representing three pair-wise comparisons ranking the 500 highest scoring pairs of essential genes. Each row corresponds to a unique combination of 13 genes originally identified either through ChIP"

The facility will launch later this year and support the creation of up to 2,500 jobs. The new centre at the former Kingfisher factory is designed so that it can accommodate a range of deliveries including commercials, parcels, freight, services or passenger trips by drone and vehicle - an area known as Multi-Mode Aviation (MMA). ""We are investing 9 million into our world-class MMA development program over five years with plans to offer full-scale testing facilities for EV vehicles such as autonomous driving kits and self-driving testbeds,"" said Alex Dolan, Chief Commercial Officer, VanMoof. Using drone technology and sensors, the new airport promises to make deliveries more efficient. It will also help develop infrastructure which enables drone use in rural areas where roads cannot be accessed easily. Currently being built next door to General Motors' future plant in Maidenhead, the airport's base has been strategically located close to major road links. ""The site offers both connectivity from existing routes outwards along the A319 route towards Cambridge Airport, London City through Canary Wharf via M3 M1 and access onto Motorway Network Route 10 between Doncaster and Sheffield via junction 14 of A42AH71M6 explained Dave Spratt, Managing Director with lumiAir Group who made the announcement. With flexible working arrangements already available on-site, companies have started to see huge returns on investment within short space of time. This includes Amazon, DHL Express and Wingless Solutions amongst others. With benefits including reduced logistics costs, improved business agility and boosted brand awareness, the location makes sense given what other industries are forecast to experience."

LLAMA,tldr-281,"A study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has found that Far-UVC light can safely kill 99.9 of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets. Conventional UV lamps can kill viruses on surfaces, but this is the first time scientists have been able to use this type of light to kill a virus in the air. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The study, published in Scientific Reports, shows that the Far-UVC light can be used to kill airborne SARS and MERS coronaviruses. ""This study shows that Far-UVC light has a major advantage over [the] conventional germicidal UV light in that Far-UVC kills viruses in the air, and also on surfaces,"" says David J. Brenner, PhD, lead author of the study and a professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. Far-UVC light, which has wavelengths between 207 and 222 nanometers, has been used for disinfecting water, food and surfaces. However, because it has high-energy components, it can't be used in the presence of people. The study shows that Far-UVC light could be used in public spaces, such as airports, public transportation, doctors' offices and schools. ""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" says Brenner. ""That means it's not only safe; it's not something that we have to worry about as far as it affecting us."" While UVC light is currently used to disinfect surgical tools and surfaces, it can't be used to disinfect the air because of the hazards to the eyes and skin. The study, which was conducted in a lab, tested Far-UVC lights' ability to kill aerosolized coronaviruses. The coronavirus was released into a test chamber, and then the Far-UVC light was turned on for varying lengths of time. To determine how effective the Far-UVC light was, the scientists measured the viral load in the chamber. The results showed that the Far-UVC light was able to greatly reduce the level of viral particles in the air. Further experiments showed that Far-UVC light could kill coronaviruses in the air, whether the air was circulating or still. ""This study shows that two hours of Far-UVC light can kill 95 percent of the virus in the air, and 45 minutes of Far-UVC light can kill 90 percent of the virus,"" says Brenner. He notes that, even though the Far-UVC light can't penetrate through human skin, it can penetrate clothes, which means it could be used to kill viruses in closed spaces. ""For public health workers that are in the midst of an outbreak, this could help decontaminate an entire space,"" says Brenner. He adds that the light can be mounted on the ceiling, walls or floor. ""The light could be mounted in the ceiling or on the walls or floor. We can take our germicidal technology and make it into a thin coating that could be sprayed or rolled on almost any surface. ""You could use this technology in a subway station or an airport or any enclosed area."""

Researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill reported in an article in Science that a 50-watt ultraviolet lamp would kill 99.99 percent of coronaviruses. Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute said that they had found that a single 250-watt ultraviolet lamp could kill up to 99.999 percent of coronaviruses. The first commercial UVC lamps were developed in 1990. By 2000, a significant number of UVC lamps were being sold. It was not until 2012 that a company developed a low-pressure mercury lamp with a short bulb that produced a blue light with a wavelength of 254 nanometers. By 2017, UVC lamps with the same short bulb were being produced at a volume of 20,000 units per year. By 2020, the company was selling 200,000 units per year. In addition to the UVC lamps, there are other UV lamps that are being sold. One of the most common is a UVC lamp with a long bulb that produces a blue light with a wavelength of 365 nanometers. There are also lamps with a longer bulb that produce a blue light with a wavelength of 380 nanometers. Hundreds of millions of UV lamps are being sold. They are used in everything from golf courses to laboratories to bakeries to paint stores. A significant number of UV lamps are sold to hospitals for use in the operating room. The UV lamps are used to sterilize the operating room and also sterilize other equipment. The UV lamps are also used to sterilize the surfaces of medical equipment and instruments. Countries around the world have been switching to UV lamps to kill viruses in the air. They have been ordered by the World Health Organization to do so. Some countries have ordered all of the existing UV lamps to be used in hospitals. In 2018, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that states that UV lamps should not be used for cleaning rooms. However, the FDA issued a statement in 2019 that states that ""UVC lamps may be used for cleaning rooms to prevent the spread of disease.""

A theoretical model was reported recently by Chen et al [83] to explain previous experimental results on spatial frequency selectivity in static and dynamic amplitude-only 2D synthetic wavelength hologram generation. In this paper we extend their approach to understand the effects of the temporal variation in amplitude modulation intensity (AMID). When AMID changes over time during pulse shaping process, the desired fringe spacing between two adjacent zero-order spots will also change accordingly because of the Fourier transform nature of wavelet transformation process. Hence an additional factor called ""temporal extent"" has just begun to be considered when dealing with the mathematical expression of single-shot synthetic wavelength holograms. The remainder of our manuscript is organized as follows: Firstly we introduce how well to use a bandpass filter function (BPF) pulse shape to describe the continuous-time signal obtained after a modulator based on a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), followed by describing a simple example where it is not necessary to take into account all these factors simultaneously. Then we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate theoretically why such a phenomenon exists so consistently and quantitatively. Finally we present conclusions about the importance of considering both the spatial location and temporal evolution of the object under investigation and what could motivate future work along these lines. A where 0 is the central central wavelength of the pump laser; L 1 and L 2 are half-wave plates oriented 45 degrees relative to each other. Assuming 90 o in Fig. 1a), then Eq. (1) Here V k represents the voltage value generated by DAC; denotes its integral time; p indicates the number of pulses emitted by the driver; f s represents the sample rate or Fs. By substituting the values into Eq. (2), one obtains It is clear that every real-signal processed through BPFs always undergoes this equation processing procedure once only: When a pulse compressor is implemented before the nonlinear medium, there is usually no need to consider those factors simultaneously since they may cancel out each other. However, if the amount of electrical energy required to maintain a constant output power increases continuously while keeping unchanged the repetition rate, which means that more electrical energy would be consumed up at slower frequencies. Of course, even though there still might exist some residual low-frequency components left behind, SDCF should be able to reduce them down sufficiently to avoid any issues caused by unwanted distortions. So far many simulations have shown that an appropriate choice of input parameters does indeed make this happen but without explaining how exactly, i.e., whether considering all three aspects together actually improves the quality of the reconstructed signals.

PaLM,tldr-282,"Synthetic wavelength holography is a new non-line-of-sight method that can rapidly capture full-field images of large areas with submillimeter precision. The method has endless potential applications, including noninvasive medical imaging, security, and industrial inspection. Synthetic wavelength holography works by modulating the wavelength of a light beam and then using an interferometer to record the interference pattern between the modulated beam and a reference beam. The interference pattern is then processed to reconstruct a full-field image of the object. This method has several advantages over traditional holographic imaging methods. First, it does not require the object to be in the direct line of sight of the imaging system. This makes it possible to image objects that are behind obstacles or that are moving. Second, the method is very fast, allowing images to be captured in a matter of milliseconds. Third, the method is highly sensitive, allowing it to detect small changes in the object's shape or position. Synthetic wavelength holography is still a relatively new technology, but it has already shown great promise in a variety of applications. In one study, researchers used synthetic wavelength holography to image the interior of a human heart. The images were of such high quality that they allowed the researchers to see the heart valves and chambers in detail. In another study, researchers used synthetic wavelength holography to image a security checkpoint. The images were able to detect hidden objects, such as weapons and drugs, that were not visible to the naked eye. Synthetic wavelength holography is a promising new technology with a wide range of potential applications.

To accomplish this feat, scientists will be able to analyze atoms that were formed at the end of the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. The first steps of the experiment are to use beams of atoms to measure the energies of these atoms, which will allow scientists to determine what elements they are. ""The key to this experiment is understanding how to collect the atoms and measure their energy,"" said Dr. Jeff Parker, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ""This is the first time we have ever measured the energy of atoms created by the Big Bang."

Among these pieces will be some rare isotopes that have never been observed before. The rare isotopes will be separated from the rest of the debris using sophisticated equipment and then studied by researchers to better understand the properties of matter.

Next, there's another set of slides from a session at CloudNativeCon.io, where I talk about setting up and using a cluster-level auth system, based on OpenID Connect. This is a bit different from the ""authentication"" above, because the goal is to let users login to your cluster and use the cluster resources, but the ""auth"" itself is happening at a higher level. I show some code, and also a demo where I connect a bunch of services together. I also talk about how to write secure, decoupled CRDs. (Some slides are shown below.) Next, we've got some slides from the Docker Security Summit, where I talk about securing containers and DaemonSets. Docker has done a great job of making it really easy to create and manage containerized applications. Unfortunately, that's the easy part.

OpenAI,tldr-284,"Everyone is talking about Kubernetes! Apps running in these workloads probably have the concept of users. And where you have users, you have auth. We'll cover topics like service-to-service communication, authentication and authorization in Kubernetes, commonly known as Kubernetes auth. In Kubernetes, service-to-service communication happens quite frequently. When a microservice calls another microservice, it's important that the calling microservice is authorized to access the other microservice's resources. This is where Kubernetes auth comes into play. Kubernetes auth is implemented using the Kubernetes API server, which is the main control plane of the system. There are several ways to authenticate in Kubernetes, including: - Certificates: Service accounts can be used to grant access to Kubernetes resources using X.509 certificates. Kubernetes uses client certificates to authenticate service accounts. - Tokens: Tokens can be used to authenticate users or service accounts. Tokens are generally self-contained and can encode information such as user ID, group memberships, and expiration time. - OpenID Connect (OIDC): This is an open standard that defines how authentication information is exchanged. Kubernetes can be configured to use OIDC for authentication. Once a user or service account is authenticated, Kubernetes uses authorization policies to determine which resources the user or service account has access to. Kubernetes authorization can be controlled using several mechanisms: - Role-based access control (RBAC): RBAC defines roles and their permissions. You can create and assign roles to users or groups of users. - Attribute-based access control (ABAC): ABAC defines policies based on attributes like user, group, and IP address. - Node authorization: Kubernetes can be configured to authorize nodes based on properties like node name or labels. In summary, Kubernetes auth is a critical part of securing your Kubernetes cluster. By using Kubernetes auth, you can ensure that only authorized users and services can access your resources."

Many companies have only one product line, for example, a print or photo lab, or a data center. Organizations with multiple products often have one platform to track and organize customer data, but the platforms are not connected, resulting in fragmented data. The challenge: When customers switch products or services, the data that should link the customer to the different products is lost. The result: Marketing spends more time re-creating customer profiles, and marketing data is fragmented and difficult to access. The solution: Marketing must work closely with IT to ensure that the customer data that flows from IT to marketing is connected, complete, and accurate.

Establish a standard. IT and marketing should collaborate on the structure of the data to make it easier for marketing to access and use. The first step is to create a standard that allows marketing to access all customer data from a common place. It's not a question of creating a single platform; rather, it's a question of establishing a standard that allows marketing to access data from multiple sources. 2. Connect the data. Marketing and IT must create a system that allows the customer data to be pulled from one platform into another. The platform should allow for easy updates to the data, including adding and deleting data, as well as providing a view of the data. 3. Share the data. Marketing and IT should collaborate to ensure that the customer data is available to marketing from multiple platforms. The goal is to allow marketing to access the data across multiple platforms without the data having to be copied. 4. Integrate the data. IT and marketing should collaborate to create a platform that allows the data to be pulled from multiple sources and integrated into one platform. 5. Create a single view of the customer.

The new study suggests that dreams can be influenced in real time, even if the person is asleep. The findings could have implications for those who are suffering from anxiety or insomnia. 'Our study suggests that dreaming can be influenced in real time, even if the dreamer is asleep,' said the study's lead author Matthew Sobel, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UC San Diego School of Medicine. 'We have demonstrated that we can program a dream by using an app to observe a person's brain activity while they sleep. 'The dreamer can then modify his or her brain activity to match the topic of the dream.' The scientists found that people who had been exposed to the word 'suffering' in their dreams experienced anxiety-related brain activity during the day. 'We used this technique to stimulate anxiety-related brain activity in a person who had never been exposed to the word 'suffering' in his dreams,' said Sobel. 'We were able to induce anxiety-related brain activity even though the person was not aware of the word 'suffering' in his dreams.' 'We were able to induce anxiety-related brain activity even though the person was not aware of the word 'suffering' in his dreams.' Sobel and his team used a method called the emotional word effect. This method involves a person recalling a negative memory and then naming a neutral object. The researchers used this method to insert the word 'suffering' into a person's dreams. The scientists then measured the changes in a person's brain activity while he slept. They found that the changes in brain activity corresponded to the topic in the dream. 'We were able to induce anxiety-related brain activity even though the person was not aware of the word 'suffering' in his dreams,' said Sobel. The study is published in the journal PLOS One.

LLAMA,tldr-289,"Scientists can manipulate dreams using an app combined with a sleep-tracking device called Dormio. In a recent study, the researchers inserted certain topics into a person's dreams using the technique. The dream manipulation method works by detecting the sleep patterns of a person using the Dormio. The sleep-tracking device sends a smartphone app a signal when the person is in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. When the Dormio detects that a person is dreaming, the app plays sounds that match the content of the dream. For example, if a person is dreaming about running on a beach, the app plays the sound of the waves. The app only plays the sounds when the person is in the REM stage of sleep. The Dormio is able to differentiate between sleep stages by using a technique called actigraphy. Actigraphy can detect the changes in the movements of a person as they sleep. It can detect when a person is tossing and turning, or if they are in a deep sleep. The REM stage is when dreaming occurs, but it only lasts 20 minutes or so. This is why the sounds need to be played at the right time. The researchers tested their technique in a lab by playing the sounds from a smartphone app. They also tested it by playing the sounds from a bedside lamp. The dream manipulation method was able to influence the dreams of 96 percent of the participants. In the study, the researchers divided the participants into two groups. One group had the app play sounds related to the content of the dream. The other group had the app play sounds unrelated to the dream. For example, if the person was dreaming about a dog, the researchers had the app play a dog barking sound. If the person was dreaming about a car crash, the app played the sound of a car crash. After the participants woke up, the researchers asked them to write down the content of their dreams. The study found that the dream manipulation technique had more success in influencing the dreams of the group that had the app play sounds related to the content of the dream. The researchers then asked the participants to explain how the sounds they heard during their dreams had affected their dreams. The researchers found that the dream manipulation technique had a better chance of affecting the dreams of people who were familiar with the sounds they heard while they were dreaming. The study was published in the journal Neuron on Dec. 14."

The Dormio app and device track the sleeper's brain activity during the initial stage of sleep, known as hypnagogia, and once specific patterns are detected, the app delivers audio cues to influence the dream content. This new method has potential applications in fields such as therapy, education, and creativity."

Also when you are sleeping it stimulates hormones like growth hormone melatonin helping elevate mood as well (8). So what does this have anything todo wout REM? Well we know light suppresses our productionof Melatoninthe brain causing us not only drowsiness but also changes how much deep or slow wave stages one gets while dreaming. Therefore decreases night time performance, increases daytime groggness unless adequate dose taken[67], suggesting lllight therapy has its benefits on non dream stage functions too!

This project was started by user daveh from Gitter (with contributions from users alicewilde kimberlyb). The original author of this code base is Dave Hanson. I wrote these articles in collaboration with my good friend Michael Joyner on his blog at If you know someone who needs some help getting their ducks in order financially then please pass this along... Before writing about angels today it will be best if we discuss what exactly are they? Angels have long been seen as messengers charged with guiding people through life's challenges or helping them solve problems that seem impossible to fix. They also provide spiritual guidance throughout our lives and can even allow us to connect with God himself! There are multiple religions that believe in angelic beings but most Christians see angels like Gods sent down into the world to spread love around the planet. There are certain Scriptures where Jesus talks quite openly about angels - he says ""you shall not kill"" (John 10:10); tells us to pray to ""the father"" instead of simply him in John 14:13-14; tells us to ask ""Hail Mary full of grace..."" when we feel worried in Luke 1:38-39 etc. But there is no mention of any specific kind of animal shape entity asking such things of humans! Or the ones supposedly called ""angels of death"" knocking on doors demanding our physical presence? It has been said that the main reason why too many believers don't believe in an actual needy heavenly government is because of unfounded stories told thousands and hundreds of years ago by clerics who were influenced by medieval beliefs about demons and demonic possession. These stories included supernatural creatures being forced away from their bodies during sleep and having horrific experiences in hell after dying which had terrified children until Christianity became widely accepted worldwide more than 2000 years later. Many still go so far as to say we're all possessed by demons every night due to the fearful legend surrounding these entities but Michael Joyner doesn't buy this stuff. He explains that while it's true angels do visit Terrans (humans), they only come once per lifetime unless one asks them directly to visit again. What happens next depends entirely upon one's behaviour. If your actions reflect kindness towards others and faithfulness to yourself and other human knows you'll get another chance; if you're evil you fail miserably and can't return. Believing in angels helps assign meaning to our own lives without resorting to crazy interpretations of events like those mentioned above. The first time I came across this concept of 'prayer animals' was back in 1998 when I read Nicholas Carr's book ""The Shallows: Why"" (it mentions prayer animals too!). Involving myself in various communities online over the last ten plus years I've now become aware of several different groups dedicated solely to teaching how to request petitions from animals including cats, dogs, birds and fish! Some of the literature suggests using particular phrases or chants based around sacred geometry whilst others suggest direct communication between the petitioners and the requested pets via some type of methodical strumming of metallic objects attached to the limbs of the requesting person. While I'm sure prayer animals exist there really seems little evidence just yet either way. It's hard enough convincing ourselves that invisible forces like gods could help us do something; but imagine explaining that miracles happen nearly daily thanks to our personal prayers directed at celestial beings whom aren't materialistic individuals living off of taxes paid by real humans? Who would take me seriously anymore? Hopefully soon future research can catch up to current scientific understanding and prove whether the existence of mysterious humankind-altering beings is worthy of our total belief system or merely superstition.

It also integrates with an established suite of third-party services like dropbox, S3, Amazon ECS, etc. Why axum? Because: We've been using tower for a long time and it has matured into a great framework. The axum community has been growing rapidly and is very active. Axum offers a lot of additional services, such as HTTP timeouts, tracing, compression, and authorization. Axum is based on the same core technology as tower. The existing core code is more than 10 years old, and so it's already well tested. The tower community has been around for a long time, so there are lots of contributors and tools that can be used to get started quickly. Tower has a solid infrastructure for managing extensions, so there are a lot of components already available. There are a lot of services built on top of tower, such as a full API to Elasticsearch, a great Vault client, and a solid, secure vault extension. What is axum's licensing?

BigScience,tldr-291,"axum is a web application framework that takes full advantage of the tower and tower-http ecosystem of middleware, services, and utilities to get timeouts, tracing, compression, authorization, and more for you. It uses NodeJS as its main runtime engine which makes it easy to integrate with other technologies such as Express or any Java-based server. The name ""Tower"" came from an analogy between how we think about applications in general (e.g., Facebook) versus websites (e.g., Twitter). Tower provides the same type of abstraction over your infrastructure like CoreOS does on bare metal hardware: Instead of having to worry about the CPU core allocation amongst all processes running concurrently or whether each process has enough memory to run effectively, you can simply focus on building meaningful functionality while knowing what will happen at scale. A: I have questions regarding performance in regards to latency improvements. Obviously I don't want my app load times to increase but I do wonder if there are certain things within app development itself I'm doing wrong. In particular, when using the nodejs http module specifically before sending requests, am I better off checking whether there's been data available since our last request? My understanding so far is this should be done once per connection instead. This would allow us to avoid starting TCP connections every time we make a new request without actually blocking until some kind of response comes back from the remote end. Is this assumption correct? Another way of looking at things is this. When working with socket programming languages like node, one thought often occurs is: ""Okay, the clientremote side needs to spend some effort establishing a TCPIP connection for me to talk to them, then they need to transfer their data across the wire... now because I've already established a new thread that's been waiting around here for it to finish I'll probably get into trouble later on if someone else wants to call another function first?"" Sounds reasonable right? Well, it's not really. The overhead associated with creating these threads places a significant costpain point on both sides that leads many people towards writing code like: Client Side Code var client ...; open socket and wait for state change events if (clientstate OPENSTATE) { var recvrdata; ... } ... etc... And on the receiving end we'll have: ... function receive { ... return data; This might block } ... I'd love to hear opinions based on industry best practices andor experiences? A: For those interested in kernel-mode networking TCP transport, here's Larry's contribution to StackOverflow discussing why you're better off handling responses yourself than relying solely upon OS-level operations. (He also includes a short discussion on TCP vs UDP.) That said, I wouldn't say goodbye to OS level features altogether - especially where network initialization termination heartbeats go - unless absolutely necessary."

The new policy went into effect on December 14, 2017. The base pay of 1.40 per mile is the highest in the industry, according to TechCrunch.

Drivers will still receive a ""quality bonus"" based on performance. A driver with a 4.85 rating will receive a 50 cent bonus per order, while a driver with a 4.90 rating or higher will receive a 1 bonus per order.

All tips are included in the 1.00 minimum payment, regardless of how much you are tipped. You will not be required to pay 1.00 for every 100 you spend. So, if you spend 100 on groceries and are tipped 5, you will still receive the minimum payment of 1.00.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. MoviePass is coming back. The movie ticket subscription service that helped drive millions of customers to the theaters, but ultimately went bankrupt, has been acquired by cofounder Stacy Spikes, and will relaunch in early 2020. The new MoviePass, now called MoviePass Entertainment, has been acquired out of bankruptcy for an undisclosed amount below 250,000. Spikes said in a statement that MoviePasss future will be about more than just discounted movie tickets. MoviePass was a data-driven marketing company, but its first chapter was the theatrical exhibition business, Spikes said. This chapter of MoviePass is about entertainment and building community. We are about to take a wild ride here, Spikes wrote in the statement. This acquisition is just the beginning. Stacy Spikes, cofounder of MoviePass, believes MoviePass will come out on top. MoviePass Entertainment MoviePass Entertainment is focused on two main areas: movie ticket subscription and media. The media aspect will include an online media destination, a radio show, podcast, and video content. The movie ticket subscription service will launch in early 2020, with Spikes planning to start with a small group of subscribers in select cities. Spikes said in a statement that the price for the subscription service will be between 9.95 and 14.95 a month. MoviePass had a booming success when it launched in 2017. The service, which allowed members to see as many movies as they wanted in a month for a flat fee, attracted more than 3 million subscribers at its peak. But MoviePass couldnt make that business model work. Ultimately, MoviePass ran out of money to pay for movie tickets, and in August it announced that it was temporarily shutting down its service. Spikes has a theory for why the company went under. He believes that many of the companies that followed MoviePasss lead, like AMCs A-List and Sinemas Sinemia, will eventually go out of business, and MoviePass will emerge as the leader. Spikes said in a statement that MoviePass has a unique and experienced team, and a data-driven technology platform. We will have to be flawless in our execution, he said. I believe we will be.

Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a way to keep ice cream soft even at room temperature, by using a gel that prevents the formation of large ice crystals. The gel is made of a polymer called poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which is a common ingredient in food and medicine. The gel is added to the ice cream mixture before it is frozen, and it forms a network of tiny fibers that trap the water molecules and prevent them from forming large crystals. This keeps the ice cream soft and creamy, even after it has been left out of the freezer for a while."
LLAMA,tldr-297,"Ice cream develops a crunchy texture if left out of the freezer for too long due to overly large ice crystals. Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a new process that makes it possible to create ice cream that stays creamy and soft for longer. The scientists discovered that exposing ice cream mix to a high pressure environment results in smaller ice crystals. Small ice crystals mean the ice cream remains creamy and soft, even if it has been stored at room temperature for some time. The process involves forcing the mix through a high-pressure nozzle and cooling it very quickly. This stops the ice crystals from forming. The ice cream can then be stored at low temperatures. The results are promising: the new technique makes it possible to store the ice cream for 2 to 3 months at -5 C (23 F) and for one month at -18 C (0 F). The new technique is still being tested and could come to market in the near future.

Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a way to melt these hardened crystals so that their frosting remains soft. The research team, led by Professor David Donnelly and Associate Professor Neil Williams, used computer simulations based on crystallographic principles found in nature as well as thermodynamic calculations to determine how best to break down ice formation in frozen foods such as sundaes bases or even smoothies. The researchers then built an experimental apparatus using copper water heat exchangers with heating coils coated with special polymers designed to lower freezing point without melting the product itself. ""The main theoretical problem was knowing what kind of cooling mechanism should be used and also understanding where the optimal operating temperature is when it comes to different types of food products because they're not all going to respond the same way"" said Bachelor's student, Timothy Youleech, who conducted his thesis work under Dr. Donelly at UT-Knoxville's College of Veterinary Medicine Biomedical Sciences Department of Food Science Extension Center. Youleech says he worked closely with the scientists during the course of his study to develop new apparatus called phase change materials (PCMs) which are capable of low-temperature vaporization while maintaining both thermal stability and high conductivity properties demanded by commercial refrigeration equipment. PCMs generally consist of hydrophobic particles surrounded by a polymeric matrix able to absorb a certain amount of energy upon freezing before releasing this stored latent heat of fusion through evaporation of its constituent liquid molecules into the surrounding medium once the applied heat source has been removed."

Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a technique that involves using a plant-based additive to stop the formation of these crystals. The technique was inspired by the structure and functionality of antifreeze proteins found in plants and animals that thrive in sub-zero temperatures. It could prove useful in the cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. The additive could be in products within the next five years."
OpenAI,tldr-297,"Ice cream develops a crunchy texture if left out of the freezer for too long due to overly large ice crystals. Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a new method to prevent large ice crystals from forming in ice cream. Instead of traditional cooling methods, the researchers used a process called micro-cooling, which involves rapidly cooling the ice cream at a very low temperature of -196 C. This technique allows the ice cream to freeze quickly, preventing large ice crystals from forming and improving the overall texture and taste of the ice cream. In addition to improving the texture of ice cream, this new method could also have applications in other frozen foods, such as frozen fruits and vegetables, and in the preservation of biological materials like blood and semen. Overall, this new technology has the potential to revolutionize the frozen food industry and improve the quality and shelf life of frozen foods."
BigScience,tldr-298,"Disney CEO Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board on September 10, the same day that Apple unveiled the launch date and subscription price for the Apple TV Plus. The introduction of Apple's new premium video service has sparked a fierce debate among consumers over whether it is worth paying 9 per month to access exclusive content. The company also announced its third quarter fiscal results yesterday with gross revenue up 40 percent compared to last year's third-quarter gross revenues; however, net income was down by 13 percent and profit before taxes was reduced by 19 percent year-over-year in part due to higher expenses related to acquisitions made during 2019. Apple also reported an increase in overall customer base, of 4 million customers since September 2018 including 1.4 million who paid monthly subscriptions where Apple now has 50 million active users as of Q3 2020. At the end of Q3; the total number of customers had increased by more than 500 thousand: 8.5 million subscribers and 2.6 million paid customers - which means some 230,000 customers joined their services each week (or three times)."

The introduction of a major new streaming service by one company is not entirely unusual - Netflix did much to make people realize you can have all your video in just about any format anywhere when it was introduced back at CES 2017 (that's why Google took so long with YouTube Premium). But Disney has an exclusive deal making its own content available through ESPN, which launches later this year as well - and some observers think ""too many cooks"" are creating too little value out there right now I suspect we'll still get more announcements like these before 2019 comes around: Netflix already announced three big shows earlier last month, including Paul Rudd starring vehicle Living With Yourself; comedy special hosted By Dave Chappelle; plus feature film Our Planet.

The introduction of a new streaming service from the iPhone manufacturer could be a conflict of interest for Iger, as Disney launches Disney Plus on November 12. Iger sat on the Apple board for almost eight years, but his relationship with Apple CEO Tim Cook goes back to 2006, when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs convinced Disney to buy Pixar. Iger was the only Disney executive who was notified of Jobs's serious illness and then his death in 2011. In a statement, Apple said Iger resigned to avoid ""potential conflicts of interest."" ""Bob Iger has been an excellent board member over the past eight years,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. ""More than anyone, Bob understands the value of creative ideas and knows how to put these ideas to work."" Iger is no stranger to the streaming world and it will be a difficult market. Apart from Disney Plus, the company also owns a 60 stake in Hulu. Disney has invested heavily in the streaming business and is making a bet that consumers will be willing to pay monthly for more than one streaming service. The company's goal is to attract millions of subscribers to its own services and take advantage of its extensive catalog of content.

The introduction of Apple TV Plus is seen as a direct challenge to Disney+, which is set to launch on November 12. The two streaming services are expected to compete for subscribers, and Iger's resignation from Apple's board could be seen as a sign that he is siding with Disney in the battle. Iger has been a member of Apple's board since 2011, and his resignation comes after a long and successful tenure at Disney. He is credited with leading the company's transformation into a global media powerhouse, and he is expected to play a key role in the launch of Disney+. The launch of Apple TV Plus is a major coup for Apple, and it is seen as a way for the company to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The service will offer a variety of original content, including shows from some of the biggest names in Hollywood. It is expected to be a major success, and it could give Apple a significant boost in its streaming business."

Tsinghua,tldr-300,"A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning at 1.4 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz. By observing the lightning as it traveled through the air, scientists were able to calculate the speed at which the lightning traveled through the atmosphere. This speeds are typically between 400 to 600 meters per second, which is about 760 to 1,120 mph. The speeds are not consistent with lightning traveling in a straight line, so the researchers believe the lightning traveled in an elliptical orbit. The researchers used the measurements of the three frequencies of radio waves to calculate the curvature of the orbit. They also calculated the curvature of the orbit by measuring the time it took for the three radio waves to travel through the air. The results of the calculations are in agreement with a theoretical model for elliptical orbits of lightning. The research team published their findings in the journal Nature.

That's why we did a desktop client, why we launched on mobile, why we've built our own servers, why we don't store any logs, why we've chosen not to integrate with Facebook's messenger and other companies, why we've taken the liberty to change the name of our service. It's not because we don't want to provide a great product, but because we want to provide the best possible experience for our users and we want to make sure that they feel comfortable using our service. We believe that there is a difference between privacy and security and that it's not possible to have both at the same time. For example, we think that people shouldn't be tracked and we believe that we should be able to prevent that.

LLAMA,tldr-301,"Signal is a private messaging app that doesn't track or store data on its users. In this thread, the Signal development team answers questions by Redditors. The team plans to pop in from time to time to answer questions about the app. ut3hCrypt Signal Development Team QA with the Signal Development Team Hi, we're the Signal development team. We're here to answer your questions. Are there any plans for a webdesktop client in the future? Yes, we plan to do a webdesktop client eventually, but we haven't started on it yet. Being that the NSA can easily break AES and probably break Elliptic Curve Cryptography, what is the point of using Signal? People have been trying to break AES for 15 years and they've had no success. The same goes for the ECC curves we use. We don't see any reason to believe that the NSA can break them. Regardless, the NSA can always break any system if they can coerce you to give them your keys. That's why we're putting a lot of effort into building features that reduce the need for keys. Is there any concern with Whisper Systems being a corporate entity and the fact that (as I understand it) the keys are held on their servers? Yes, that's a concern. That's why we're building features that reduce the need for keys. Can you comment on how Signal's encryption stack compares to that of RedPhoneTextSecure? Signal uses the TextSecure protocol, which is used by both Signal and TextSecure. The only difference between the two apps is that TextSecure supports SMS messages, while Signal does not. Is it possible to integrate Signal into a non-Google Play store ROM? This is a bit complicated. Signal uses the TextSecure protocol, which is open source. You can integrate the protocol into whatever ROM you want. However, the Signal app is not open source, so you can't just take the app itself and put it on a different store. What are your plans to have Android 4.4 support? We'll probably make a 4.4 branch of the app that will work on older Android versions. That said, we'd really like for all of our users to upgrade to Android 5.0 because the new permissions system makes it much easier to keep your private messages private. I'd just like to say a big thanks for the hard work and dedication you guys are putting into making signal better! It's a great app and I'm really happy to support you guys! Keep up the good work! Why is it that all Signal messages are sent with Signal? That's because all of our users are required to install Signal. If you send a Signal message to someone who doesn't have the app installed, the message will be sent using Signal's fallback transport (the regular phone number). If they install the app later, the fallback messages will automatically be converted into Signal messages. We considered building a non-Signal version of the app that only uses SMS messages, but we decided not to do that because it would have required a lot of complicated fallback logic. Is there any difference between the RedPhone and Signal encryption stacks, besides the obvious SMS support on RedPhone? I see you are moving away from the RedPhone name, so I assume there must be some reason. RedPhone and Signal use the same encryption stack. The only difference is that RedPhone supports SMS messages, while Signal does not. We decided to move away from the RedPhone name because we don't think it accurately describes the app any more. The goal of the app is to replace the regular phone call functionality, and ""RedPhone"" sounds like a VoIP app (which it is not). I'd like to use Signal but my friends are more comfortable with Facebook Messenger. I'm wondering if you guys have considered making it easier to communicate between the two platforms and if that's something you guys are planning to do? I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's possible without a whole lot of complexity. If we're going to make it easy to chat with someone who doesn't use Signal, we'd rather do it through SMS messages than through Facebook. SMS messages are a lot simpler than Facebook, and the fallback logic is much easier to handle. Just wanted to say that I was happy to see the new update to the app that included group messaging. I really like"

Our interview series continues from last week's discussion between Kirstian Grnnemark, founder and CEO at Freeooo Limited, and Daymond John, co-founder and Chairman Emeritus at FUBU Group Inc., who gave us his advice during the year he spent leading Universal Studios Japan. (As always, please feel free to post any additional thoughts below!) 2. Do you think there are some fundamental differences in business culture between Asia and America? Daymond: It seems that many executives here don't understand what they need to do beyond just closing sales meeting after sale meeting. They think ""people buy my stuff"" - which means only letting people see the product physically before selling it. I think most Asian cultures want everything fast - they often say ""nothing good happens overnight"" - but Americans generally take things slowly and that's not necessarily bad because sometimes nothing worthwhile ever does happen overnight. You should build something big enough to become successful 'on purpose' - not accidentally - and then let others help make it bigger. If businesses aren't growing quickly or multiple times over, executives should focus on figuring out why. Both groups seem to lean toward positivity despite failure and an open mindset towards new ideas and opportunities even though growth has stalled. Daymond: If executives spend three minutes thinking ""buying must increase 50 next month,"" then they won't find anything wrong with themselves unless they also think ""my life will go down the toilet if I make that mistake."" However, once someone learns through experience and mistakes that success doesn't come easy or instantaneously, such attitude becomes helpful rather than detrimental. Overall, however, Chinese companies tend to treat employees better than American ones while bringing much less value to customers. So although being honest might hurt short-term profits, it's really usually well received long-term because honesty helps all stakeholders connect directly with each other without unnecessary middlemen or intermediaries. Kirstian: Mostly American leaders assume their decisions benefit everyone except them personally, therefore making it difficult to admit errors made and learning lessons gained from failed attempts. Most importantly, not knowing where one's company stands financially makes it impossible to avoid wasting resources unnecessarily. One example I've seen time and again would be: A European leader wants to put two billion euros into building a factory but fails to ask whether consumers actually require such products anymore or wantneed it cheaper somewhere else instead. Therefore, he uses half of the money to develop some innovative servicesproposals competing against existing offerings in order to generate income for himself, staff members, stockholders, etc. And keeps the rest invested in marketing activities. Daymond: Anyone could create an internet site especially designed to sell eBooks for 5 per copy, but attract only 2,000 orders annually, yielding no profit whatsoever, and leave 80 percent of net earnings back to itself. In contrast, when Amazon creates a site intended purely to set eBook prices, collect shipping fees, and charge consumers 5 percent commission amounting to 40 million dollars monthly turnover. (and leaves 80 percent to its investors.) Many small-to-mid-sized enterprises choose to follow the second path since they lack sufficient understanding of consumer preferences andor demand patterns. Especially regarding more important factors determining enterprise survival, such as: customer satisfaction rate, retention rates, advertising costs, brand recognition, differentiation strategy, ability to innovate, economies-of-scale, etc. Kirstian: There needs to be enough transparency among top management teams for different levels within organizations to effectively communicate with each other. For instance, if an employee asks a manager how the organization will handle certain crisis situation, managers should immediately send corresponding instructions to relevant departments ahead of expected outcomes if possible since graduates may end up taking shortcuts due to ignorance. (While attending a conference recently, I heard a headline claiming Google is hiring 30,000 engineers. How? With google ads. Horrible) Also, HR professionals need to establish mechanisms for transparent communication internally and externally. For instance, internal communications should refer to key performance indicators, competitors' practices, current market trends, industry standards, etc. On external communications, ""I'm sorry"

Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras. They're not bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, but they can be easily spotted with the aid of binoculars. Auroras are the natural light show that occurs when charged particles from the sun hit the Earth's atmosphere. When they hit the upper atmosphere, they cause the earth's magnetic field to amplify and deflect the particles into the lower atmosphere, where they create auroras. While auroras can be incredibly bright and stunning, they're also very short-lived. This new discovery is a bit of a spoiler: The diffuse auroral erasers last only a few minutes, but they can cause a lot of trouble for pilots and spacecraft, because they're difficult to see. The researchers used a computer model to examine how the diffuse auroral erasers would look from the perspective of a spacecraft. This is important, because NASA uses this technique to test spacecraft, so that they can see how well they would perform in a real-life auroral environment. Using the computer model, the researchers discovered that the diffuse auroral erasers can cause a temporary loss of signal for NASA's Deep Space Network, a collection of spacecraft that relay signals between spacecraft and the ground. In the case of a GPS, this loss of signal can lead to significant errors. The new discovery of the diffuse auroral erasers was published in the journal Scientific Reports. The research was led by Dr. Deanna M. Burrows, a senior research scientist at the University of Iowa's College of Engineering."
BigScience,tldr-302,"Physicists from the University of Iowa have discovered a new type of aurora in a nearly two-decade-old video. Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras seen on Earth, and they appear to be caused by irregularities at high altitudes within the ionosphere. Scientists study plasma phenomena that occur near magnetic field lines with extraordinary sensitivity: They detect tiny changes in electrical currents causing small perturbations, or filaments, in electric fields along those same lines - thereby revealing their movements through space and time (as well as sometimes locations). A team headed by researchers from the University of Michigan has discovered a mechanism for controlling ocean acidification using freshwater runoff. The work shows how changing surface waters can affect which species thrive in the deep sea, leading scientists to predict an accelerated rate of global warming-driven toxic algae blooms due to climate change. By measuring geomagnetic activity during solar storms over more than 20 years, astronomer Dane Wu from Carnegie Institution of Washington revealed a correlation between intense storms - capable of destroying communications satellites and disrupting power grids - and higher-than-usual amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide released into Earth's upper atmosphere. The key finding is based on three independent measurements across disparate regions, spanning Antarctic ice sheets and Greenland glaciers to mountain tops above the Arctic Circle."

Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras , but they appear to wipe out small portions of the auroral displays for a brief period of time. This new type of aurora was first spotted by studying footage from a 2002 event, where a diffuse aurora was occurring alongside a more active auroral band. The researchers noticed that the diffuse aurora would momentarily dim certain parts of the active auroral band, as if erasing them. Further analysis revealed that this was due to a type of plasma wave that has never been seen before. This discovery highlights the complex and ever-evolving nature of auroras and the importance of continued research in understanding them."

Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras that appears to rotate. NASA has just released a series of images of a new type of aurora that's been discovered on the planet Saturn. Saturn's auroras are caused by the planet's magnetic field interacting with the solar wind. As the aurora season comes into full swing, so too will the research of scientists from the University of Iowa, who are studying the effect of solar winds on the aurora borealis. Scientists are beginning to study a new type of aurora discovered in Antarctica last year. Researchers have discovered that the diffuse auroras are caused by a concentration of electrons coming from space. A new study from the University of Colorado at Boulder shows that while the Northern Lights may be beautiful to look at, they also have a major impact on the ionosphere and Earth's magnetic field. Laboratory experiments have revealed the mechanisms behind the formation of the strange ""screaming"" sound that is created by the interaction of two colliding magnetized plasma flows."

This particular top has such a simple design that can easily work with almost any outfit because of the statement neckline and simplicity of cutout detailing. It comes with three straps that allow this shirt to tie around the waist if that's something you prefer. I think one thing I've learned through time is that there really aren't rules regarding wearing a dress underneath a jacket! Because the material itself doesn't show enough detail this dress would feel nice to wear alone but it still looks amazing paired with leggings and boots."
LLAMA,tldr-307,"In 2017, Astrophysicists at the European Space Agency spotted an iceberg the size of Las Vegas breaking off the Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. The iceberg has since changed shape and split into two. Late last week, when NASA's Operation IceBridge flew its first 2018 Antarctic survey flight, the Pine Island Glacier iceberg had already changed shape and split into two. The massive iceberg's split was first reported by Project MIDAS, a UK-based Antarctic research project that closely watches the Pine Island Glacier. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is a remnant of an iceberg that broke off in 2015 and is now known as B-44. B-44 broke into smaller fragments. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg was initially discovered in October 2017, by a group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine. It was already cracked into four pieces. The iceberg is now located in the Amundsen Sea, which has seen a number of large icebergs breaking off from the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. Since the 1990s, the Pine Island Glacier has lost a significant amount of ice. In total, the glacier has lost 270 square miles of ice, according to NASA. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg has not yet moved far from where it first broke off. But, if it does, it will likely not stay in one piece. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is one of the largest ever seen at 225 square miles, the size of Long Island, NY. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is the second massive iceberg to break off Antarctica in the last six months. The first was the 2,200-square-mile iceberg that broke off from the Larsen C Ice Shelf. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg could also be a sign of the changing climate. Thwaites Glacier is known as the ""weak underbelly"" of the Antarctic ice sheet. According to the Washington Post, if the Thwaites Glacier breaks off, it could raise sea levels by 2 feet. That would be catastrophic for coastal communities. The Thwaites Glacier iceberg is not the only Antarctic iceberg that could raise sea levels. A recently published study in the journal Nature concluded that ""Antarctic ice loss is a major contributor to sea-level rise."" The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Leeds, Imperial College London, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and other institutions. The researchers concluded that the melting of Antarctic ice, including the Pine Island Glacier iceberg, has increased sea levels by 7.6 mm since 1992. The melting of ice in Antarctica has increased by 280 percent since 2009, according to another study published in Nature. As sea levels rise, coastal communities are becoming more vulnerable to flooding and storm surges. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is not the first to break off Antarctica in the last year. But, there is more to the melting of the Pine Island Glacier iceberg and other icebergs in Antarctica than climate change. In some areas of Antarctica, such as the South Pole, temperatures have actually fallen in the last 50 years. This is due to a changing climate and the ozone hole. The loss of ice from the Pine Island Glacier iceberg could also be due to warmer ocean temperatures. The melting of the Pine Island Glacier iceberg and other icebergs has led to some unusual effects. As the Pine Island Glacier iceberg melts, the glacier behind it has sped up and become more unstable, which could lead to more icebergs. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey believe that the Pine Island Glacier iceberg may be a sign of the Pine Island Glacier becoming more unstable and that it could break off more icebergs in the future."
PaLM,tldr-307,"In 2017, Astrophysicists at the European Space Agency spotted an iceberg the size of Las Vegas breaking off the Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. The iceberg has since changed course and is now headed towards the Weddell Sea. If it melts, it could raise global sea levels by up to 10 centimeters. The iceberg is called A-76 and is the largest iceberg ever recorded in Antarctica. It is about 1,670 square kilometers (640 square miles) in size and has a volume of about 130 billion cubic meters. The iceberg is about the same size as the island of Manhattan. A-76 broke off from the Pine Island Glacier in July 2017. The glacier is one of the fastest-moving glaciers in Antarctica and is losing ice at an alarming rate. The loss of ice from the Pine Island Glacier is contributing to rising sea levels around the world. A-76 is currently drifting towards the Weddell Sea. If it melts, it could raise global sea levels by up to 10 centimeters. This would have a significant impact on coastal communities around the world. The loss of ice from the Pine Island Glacier is a warning sign of the impact of climate change on Antarctica. The glacier is one of the most vulnerable glaciers in the world and is a major contributor to rising sea levels. If the glacier continues to lose ice at its current rate, it could disappear completely within the next few decades."

Tsinghua,tldr-307,"In 2017, Astrophysicists at the European Space Agency spotted an iceberg the size of Las Vegas breaking off the Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. The iceberg has since changed course and headed for the Antarctic Peninsula, further away from the Arctic. And the same scientists have seen a 55-square-mile chunk of the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica break away in the past few days. These chunks of ice are already breaking off Antarctica and sliding into the sea. But scientists fear that with climate change, more and more ice shelves will start breaking off and floating into the ocean. This would lead to more sea level rise, even if the icebergs don't make it to the Arctic. ""If you look at a map of Antarctica, we can see there are many more ice shelves and glaciers that are already breaking up,"" Dr. Winton said. ""If you look at the ice shelves that are breaking up, they are mostly in the West Antarctic, and they are the ones that are going to cause the biggest problem for sea level rise."" 2. It's Not All About Antarctica If you think climate change is all about Antarctica, you're wrong. Antarctica is only 2 percent of the Earth's landmass, but it accounts for 20 percent of all ice. And the glaciers in Antarctica are the fastest-melting glaciers on the planet. But Antarctica is not the only place in the world where glaciers are melting. In fact, the U.S. has 25 glaciers that are shrinking. Greenland, meanwhile, is experiencing rapid melting, with ice sheet thinning and the number of glaciers dropping. And there are other glaciers in the Himalayas, and the Canadian Rockies. ""There is not just one glacier melting,"" Dr. Winton said. ""There are many glaciers in many places that are melting, and they all have different causes."" But what we do know is that glaciers in Greenland, Antarctica, and elsewhere are melting faster than ever. And we can expect the Arctic to follow suit. 3. Arctic Ice Is Melting Faster Than Ever The Arctic is the part of the world that's closest to the sun, and its melting glaciers are melting faster than ever. The Arctic has lost an average of 200,000 square miles of sea ice each year for the past three decades, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. That's a loss of 140,000 square miles a year since 2010. That's more than twice as fast as the global average. And Arctic ice is melting even faster in summer, when the sun is most powerful. ""If we look at the summer ice coverage, it is shrinking every year,"" Dr. Winton said. ""It is not shrinking any more slowly than the rest of the ice in the Arctic, so it is shrinking at a faster rate than the rest of the ice."" And scientists expect Arctic sea ice to continue to shrink in the coming decades, and then disappear entirely by the end of this century. 4. The Earth Is Still Warming If you think that the Arctic is melting because of global warming, you're wrong. The Arctic is not the only part of the world to be melting. The Earth is still warming, and that warming is mostly coming from the other parts of the planet. ""The Arctic is not the only part of the world that is warming,"" Dr. Winton said. ""The global warming that we are experiencing is mostly coming from the oceans and the land."" The Arctic is melting, but the Earth is still warming. The Arctic ice cap is shrinking, but the Earth is still warming. (Photo: the-australian-trustShutterstock) The ocean and the land are warming, and the melting of the Arctic ice cap is one of the main reasons why. ""There are other reasons why the Arctic is melting,"" Dr. Winton said. ""It is not just because of climate change."" Scientists know that Arctic sea ice melts because of climate change, but they don't know why the Arctic is melting. 5. There Is No One Reason Why The Earth Is Warming When you think of global warming, you think of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But you can't blame greenhouse gases for everything. And the Earth is not warming because of greenhouse gases. ""Global warming is not caused by the greenhouse gases,"" Dr. Winton said. ""The greenhouse gases are a good thing, they help us survive. They protect us from the sun."" There are a lot of different things that are causing the Earth to warm, but scientists don't know which ones are the biggest factors. ""There are many different factors that are causing the Earth to warm,"" Dr. Winton said. ""It is hard to say which one is the biggest."""

The mineral is named after Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao, a geophysicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who first proposed its existence in 1989. The researchers found the mineral in a diamond that was brought up from the Earth's mantle during a mining operation in South Africa. The diamond is about 1.3 billion years old, and it is thought that the davemaoite formed when the diamond was subjected to high pressure and temperature deep in the Earth's interior. The discovery of davemaoite is significant because it provides new insights into the composition of the Earth's mantle. It also suggests that the mantle may be more dynamic than previously thought, as it is possible that davemaoite could be created and destroyed over time."

Tsinghua,tldr-308,"A team of researchers has found a new mineral about 900 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Davemaoite is made of calcium, silicon, and oxygen. Its existence has been long hypothesized, but only now has it been confirmed by scientists. Scientists had long hypothesized the existence of a mineral called davemaoite. The mineral is made of calcium, silicon, and oxygen. Davemaoite is rare in the world above the Earth's surface, but this discovery is a first for the mineral below the Earth's surface. Researchers from the University of New South Wales and University of Western Australia discovered the mineral after drilling through a natural cavity called a kimberlite. The cavity is 900 kilometers below the Earth's surface. The researchers found the mineral inside the kimberlite. They confirmed the mineral's existence by using an electron microscope and X-ray powder diffraction. The mineral has an abundance of calcium, silicon, and oxygen. It is thought to have formed after calcium carbonate dissolved in a hot liquid, such as magma, and was cooled. Scientists have never before found the mineral below the Earth's surface. The mineral's presence is a big discovery, because it means that scientists can now investigate minerals that are formed deep in the Earth. They can also study minerals that have formed under extremely high pressures. These minerals can provide scientists with a better understanding of the Earth's interior. The scientists will continue to study the mineral and are hoping to discover more. ""In the case of davemaoite, it's a rare mineral, and the first one to be discovered below the Earth's surface,"" said Dr. James Weller, a geoscientist at the University of New South Wales. ""It's very interesting, and there are many questions that we can now ask about the chemical processes that occur deep in the Earth."""

LLAMA,tldr-310,"This article discusses tips and tricks for using SSH more effectively. It covers how to add a second factor to your SSH login, use agent forwarding safely, exit from stuck SSH sessions, and more. Here is a collection of tips and tricks I've picked up over the years that can help you use SSH more effectively. In case you haven't noticed, it is possible to connect to an SSH server with a key-based login without having to type a passphrase. This is convenient, but there is a risk that it exposes you to a man-in-the-middle attack. You can avoid that risk by using SSH with the ssh-agent and a passphrase-protected private key. I'll demonstrate this technique using a Mac, but it will work similarly on any other platform. If you run ssh-add -l at this point, you should see your passphrase-protected key listed. You can also run ssh-add -d, which will disable the passphrase-protected key. This might seem like more work, but it's really not, because the ssh-agent runs in the background until you explicitly kill it. To verify this, run ssh-add -l. You should see your passphrase-protected key listed. Now run ssh-add -d, which will disable the passphrase-protected key. Then run ssh-add -l, and you'll see that the passphrase-protected key is not listed. SSH is probably the most widely used technology to securely access remote machines. As the name implies, Secure Shell (SSH) was originally designed to provide a secure replacement for the original telnet protocol, which sent passwords in clear text. Like many other Unix utilities, SSH has a lot of options and features, some of which are not well known. Here are some tips and tricks for using SSH more effectively. SSH is designed to securely access remote machines using public-key cryptography. It's usually more secure to use SSH key-based login rather than password-based login. Key-based login eliminates the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack, because the SSH server is configured to accept only a key, not a password. This is a secure method, as long as you use SSH with a passphrase-protected key. If you don't use a passphrase, you risk falling victim to a man-in-the-middle attack. But if you use a passphrase-protected key, there is a risk that someone can get access to the machine you're using to generate the SSH key. In that case, the intruder could use ssh-copy-id to copy the key to another account. The solution to this risk is to generate the SSH key on a machine that is in a secure location and never let anyone else access that machine. I call this machine the ""key machine."" The first step in creating a key-based SSH login is to generate an SSH key pair. To do this, log in to the key machine, and run ssh-keygen. This will prompt you for a passphrase. You can then use ssh-copy-id to copy your public key to your remote account. To add a second factor to your SSH login, you'll need to install a program that generates one-time passcodes. One such program is Google Authenticator, which is available for Android, iOS, and Blackberry devices. Then log in to the remote server, and run ssh-copy-id to copy your public key to your remote account. Next, run google-authenticator to configure your key machine. This will prompt you to enter a user name, a secret, and an issuer. The user name is the name of the account you're using on the remote server. The secret is a random number. The issuer is the domain name of the server. You can specify the domain name with the -I option. This will generate a QR code, which you can scan with the Google Authenticator app. It will then prompt you for a passcode, which you can get from your Google Authenticator app. You should now see a 6-digit passcode that refreshes every 30 seconds. Enter the passcode, and the QR code will be saved in the remote account. Now you can log in to the remote account, and instead of being prompted for a password, you'll be prompted for a passcode. To get the passcode, simply scan the QR code displayed on your screen with your mobile device, and enter the passcode. If you have multiple accounts, you can copy the QR code to other accounts and set up passcode authentication for each one. After you set up"

Tsinghua,tldr-310,"This article discusses tips and tricks for using SSH more effectively. It covers how to add a second factor to your SSH login, use agent forwarding safely, exit from stuck SSH sessions, and more. If you're already a frequent user of SSH, you may have been wondering how to add a second factor to your login, how to use agent forwarding safely, how to exit from stuck SSH sessions, and how to make sure that the SSH daemon is running on your server. These are all excellent questions, and this article will cover them all. Step 1: Adding a second factor to your SSH login The first step in adding a second factor to your SSH login is to create a password-less authentication method. The SSH client supports two methods for password-less authentication. They are public key authentication and GSSAPI. 1. Public key authentication Public key authentication is the simplest method for password-less authentication. In this method, the server sends a public key that can be used to authenticate the user. When you login to a server, you provide your public key to the server, and it uses that key to authenticate you. If you ever lose your private key, you'll be unable to log in to the server, but your public key can still be used to log in to the server. The key to this method is that the server must have your public key. This is often a problem because the server may not be the same as the one you're logging into. In addition, it's possible for the server to deny your public key. The following diagram illustrates this scenario: 2. GSSAPI GSSAPI is an authentication method that is used by Kerberos. It's often referred to as Kerberos authentication, but that is a misnomer. Kerberos is the authentication protocol, and GSSAPI is a mechanism for authenticating with Kerberos. GSSAPI works in conjunction with a Kerberos ticket. When you try to login to a server, you first send your credentials to the server. The server sends your credentials to the Kerberos ticket server. The ticket server stores your credentials in a database. The ticket server then returns the ticket to the server. When you try to login to the server, the server sends the ticket to the client. The client uses the ticket to authenticate with the server. The client sends the server your public key, which the server uses to authenticate you. The GSSAPI protocol is very complex. It's possible for a server to deny a ticket. In addition, it's possible for a server to deny a ticket even if you provide your public key. For this reason, GSSAPI is often considered a less secure method of authentication than public key authentication. It is important to understand that GSSAPI is a protocol that is used by public key authentication. You can use GSSAPI to add a second factor to public key authentication. However, it is not the same as adding a second factor to public key authentication. In the example above, you would use GSSAPI to add a second factor to public key authentication, but you would not use GSSAPI to add a second factor to public key authentication. Step 2: Using agent forwarding safely Agent forwarding allows you to run a command on a remote machine without actually logging into the remote machine. It's important to use agent forwarding safely. If you use agent forwarding in an insecure way, it can lead to security problems. This article covers how to use agent forwarding safely. 1. Use the -A option When you use the -A option, the SSH daemon stores your key in the agent. When you use the -A option, the SSH daemon stores your key in the agent. When you use the -A option, the SSH daemon stores your key in the agent. This allows you to run a command on a remote machine without logging into the remote machine. It also allows you to run a command on a remote machine without storing the key on the remote machine. The following example shows how to use the -A option: ssh -A 2. Use the -N option When you use the -N option, the SSH daemon sends a prompt to the client. The client then sends the password to the server, and the server stores the password in the agent. The SSH daemon sends a prompt to the client. The client then sends the password to the server, and the server stores the password in the agent. The following example shows how to use the -N option: ssh -N 3. Use the -F option When you use the -F option, the SSH daemon forwards the password from the client to the server. The following example shows how to use the -F option: ssh -F 4. Use the -D option When you use the -D option, the SSH daemon stores the password in the agent. The SSH daemon then forwards the password from the agent to the server."

LLAMA,tldr-311,"A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourbanitech's tree requires no water, soil, or sunlight to do its job. The Smog-Eating Tower is designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and it is currently being tested in Mexico City, one of the world's most polluted cities. The tower was developed with the help of researchers at UNAM, Mexico's National Autonomous University. It uses a photocatalytic pigment called titanium dioxide, which is activated by the sun's rays and oxygen in the air to neutralize pollutants. Mexico City has struggled with air pollution for decades. In 1992, the UN named it the most polluted city in the world. The city has made some progress since then, but it still ranks among the world's most polluted. Biomitech plans to build 1,000 of the artificial trees over the next few years, and it says it hopes to eventually install them in urban areas around the world. The Smog-Eating Tower costs about 25,000 to build, which is much cheaper than trying to plant 368 real trees. It's also cheaper than other technology to fight air pollution. The company says that one of its trees costs about 10 percent of what it would cost to build an air-purification system. Biomitech is not the first company to develop a structure to help purify air in urban areas. In 2017, a company called Green City Solutions installed air-purifying trees in cities around Europe. They use mosses that absorb pollutants. While Biomitech's technology may be effective at cleaning up air pollution, trees do a lot more than just remove pollutants from the air. They can also help fight climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their trunks. Trees can also help prevent flooding by absorbing excess water and releasing it into the atmosphere. They can also help moderate temperatures by reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the pavement. And they look nice, too. Photo credit: Biomitech Mexico City Smog-Eating Tower"

""The latest electric locomotive prototype ran smoothly without any problems or incidents on its test track in Tianjin at an average speed of 350 kmhour, which means it passed all tests we planned from the beginning of testing last summer. The prototype achieved 300kmhour with no acceleration time. We also performed other important tests successfully, including long-distance tests over several hundred kilometres along country roads using battery power only,"" added President Wang Jing after launching the four-car highspeed train model at the firm's headquarters in Beijing earlier this month. Developed originally by Japan's Hitachi Heavy Industries Co., the electric train uses superconducting magnets and copper coils instead of steel wheels to move through rails above ground level while allowing passengers sitting inside the carriage to see panoramic views ahead thanks to windows opening vertically upwards like shutters.

It took another five years before China officially started construction work at its own site, although some sources believe that due to anti-trust concerns between countries involved, the Japanese who are partners in the project may not be allowed to build more than 50 per cent - meaning there could well remain substantial gaps within certain critical elements such as control systems, batteries, engines etc."

It could be used in both passenger and cargo transport, and could help further the development of China's high-speed rail network. China has been rapidly developing its high-speed rail network. In August, China opened the world's first fully automated high-speed rail line in Chongqing. The 300-km long line can carry up to 1,300 passengers per hour at speeds of 120 kph. It could help China's ambitious plans to expand its high-speed rail network to 38,000 km by 2025, and 150,000 km by 2050, including extending it across the world to connect China to Europe and Africa."

The train, which is called the Shanghai Maglev, is currently the fastest commercial train in operation, with a top speed of 603 kph. It runs on a 30-kilometer track between the Pudong International Airport and the Longyang Road station in Shanghai. The Shanghai Maglev is the second generation of maglev trains in China. The first generation, called the Transrapid, was developed by a German company and operated in Shanghai from 2004 to 2011. The Transrapid had a top speed of 430 kph. The Shanghai Maglev is expected to carry up to 10,000 passengers per day. It is expected to reduce travel time between the airport and the city center from 40 minutes to 8 minutes."

Despite reporting the issue to Tesla many times, he received no response. There have been several software updates since the user started reporting the issue, with some updates fixing the issue temporarily, but dashcam footage confirms that it still occurs. Tesla owner Walter Huang died in a crash at a site similar to the one where this bug occurs last year, and there is evidence that the vehicle veered towards a lane divider and sped up while on autopilot prior to the crash.

""I own a Model S, Model X, Model 3, and the Roadster. I have also driven the Model 3 in Autopilot. The following is a description of my experiences with Autopilot, based on my experience with these vehicles."" The user first reported the bug to Tesla in October 2018. When asked about the bug in a forum post, a Tesla representative responded: ""We are looking into this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention."" The bug persisted and the user continued to report it. The bug persisted for weeks, even after Tesla's representatives attempted to replicate the bug in the test lab. Finally, after months of reporting the bug, Tesla fixed it in software. The Reddit user wrote: ""When I finally got my car back in January 2019, it had been fixed. I have had no issues with Autopilot since then."" Incidents with Autopilot have been reported across the country."
LLAMA,tldr-313,"A bug in Tesla's Autopilot driving program would sometimes pull cars towards lane dividers in specific spots on a Reddit user's commute. Despite reporting the issue to Tesla many times, he says the bug persisted for over a year. The bug would tell the car to make a left turn when it was already in the leftmost lane, but sometimes the car would go to the right when it was supposed to go left. Tesla says the problem was caused by a faulty camera and was fixed in June 2017. In the case of the Reddit user's car, the bug remained even after Tesla updated the software. Tesla says it ""not aware of any instance"" of the bug in its cars. The problem was a faulty camera that was replaced by Tesla in June 2017, but it had no effect on the Reddit user's car. A Tesla representative told Business Insider that the company wasn't aware of any other instances of the problem. The Reddit user, who goes by the handle ""ugarsh,"" said he's spoken to many Tesla employees over the last year, and none of them had seen the issue before. Tesla says that its cameras don't identify lane markings as one or two lines, but rather, as three lines. ""A lane with a dotted line on one side and a solid line on the other is recognized as a single left-bound lane, and a lane with a solid line on both sides is seen as a single right-bound lane,"" the representative said. If there's a bug in the software that makes the car think it's in the rightmost lane instead of the leftmost lane, the car will try to get to the left, even though it's already in the leftmost lane. The bug persisted for many months, and Tesla was unable to fix it. ""For reasons unknown to me, Tesla's Autopilot (AP) software has a bug that causes the car to behave very strangely in a very specific location on my daily commute. AP will detect a lane divider which is actually the exit lane on a highway off ramp. After the car departs the highway, it will try to veer to the left, even though the car is already in the left lane."" The Reddit user said that he initially believed the bug was a problem with the car's GPS, but found out it was an issue with the software. ""I've brought this to Tesla's attention many times over the last year, but they've never been able to fix it. They've inspected the car several times. They've had me demo the issue to service personnel, engineers, and managers. They've tried changing the firmware. They've tried upgrading the AP hardware. They've tried disabling AP in the location. They've tried changing the lane detection sensors, and they've replaced the AP computer twice,"" the Reddit user wrote. ""I even insisted on trying to demo the problem on one of the loaner cars. I finally gave up after they swapped my car for a loaner while my car was in for service and the same issue persisted in the loaner car."" It's not clear why the car has this problem, and the Reddit user doesn't know of any other Tesla drivers who have experienced the issue. Tesla says that all of its Autopilot-equipped cars have the same hardware, but it's not clear if the software is updated at different times. The bug persisted even after Tesla updated the software. It's not clear why Tesla didn't find the bug sooner. Tesla's Autopilot system has been in use since 2015, and the software has been updated multiple times over the years. Tesla has collected more than 1.3 billion miles worth of data from Autopilot since its launch, so it's surprising the company didn't come across the problem sooner. Tesla has been pushing for full self-driving features to roll out to its cars before the end of the year. The company has even said that some cars it built since October 2016 have the hardware necessary for full autonomy, but Tesla says it's waiting for regulatory approval before rolling out those features. Tesla did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on this story. SEE ALSO: Tesla says it's going to try"
BigScience,tldr-313,"A bug in Tesla's Autopilot driving program would sometimes pull cars towards lane dividers in specific spots on a Reddit user's commute. Despite reporting the issue to Tesla many times, no one was able to fix it until now. The driver who submitted the video said that his car had been doing this for years, and that he reported multiple incidents to Tesla but never received an answer or explanation of what happened. Because Autopilot uses laser-based sensing technology rather than cameras, there are very few clear signs when something is wrong with the software - so even users who have experienced similar issues usually can't prove they were affected by Tesla's system. But in recent months, more people encountered these problems using their own vehicles as well, which led some locals to take matters into their own hands. According to The Verge, dozens of residents living near Silicon Valley shared videos showing how drivers' cars would suddenly turn toward lanes while moving at highway speeds without any obvious reason. Some of the footage shows the vehicle coming straight out of nowhere before pulling over onto roadsides; others show the cars directly hitting barriers both physical and virtual. One video posted on YouTube involved two vehicles colliding head-on after being pulled away from a traffic convoy. A third video shows three SUVs veering off an interstate bridge and crashing down into the water below. Tesla has since claimed that all instances where its autonomous-driving features can be compromised come about due to human error. It also says it's working hard to improve AutoPilot's ability to detect abnormal situations like those seen here, although there's still much work ahead."

Visit a Tesla service center: If the issue persists, you may need to visit a Tesla service center. Make an appointment with the service center and explain the problem you are facing with the Autopilot program to the technician. 3. Submit a bug report: If you believe that the issue is a bug in Tesla's Autopilot software, you can submit a bug report through Tesla's website or mobile app. Provide as much information as possible, including when and where the issue occurred and any relevant details. 4. Consider legal action: If you have experienced a serious issue with your Tesla car's Autopilot program and have exhausted all other options, you may want to consider legal action. A lawyer experienced in automotive defects and recalls can advise you on your options. Remember, always practice caution when using Autopilot and never rely solely on the system to drive your car."
BigScience,tldr-314,"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology works, sometimes it does so in ways that are counterintuitive and unwieldy from a human perspective. In its current state, deep learning often uses so-called ""black box"" methods for their modeling and training. This means that while we can see what happens within an algorithm, once it has learned to solve problems using these black-box models - even though they have been proven effective at doing so - we cannot get inside it or examine how it goes about completing each step involved in solving tasks such as image recognition and speech processing. We may think that this lack of transparency means that machine learning systems will never be able to perform well enough on some complex applications (such as autonomous driving) but that wasn't necessarily true when data analytics and machine learning were first developed 20 years ago."
LLAMA,tldr-314,"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology works, we do not know how the conclusions are reached. This is a scary thought, especially since many of these algorithms are going to be making decisions for us. For instance, we may find ourselves in court one day, with a jury, a judge and an AI to decide whether we are guilty or not. The good news is that it is possible to understand what is going on under the hood of these black box algorithms. A new method has been devised that will allow us to understand how the algorithms reach the decisions that they do. This method is called deep-Xplore, and it has the potential to change how we view AI technology. The AI Algorithm Industry There are many companies developing algorithms today. Many of these companies rely on AI, and they use algorithms to solve difficult problems. Some of these algorithms are used to predict the weather, while others are used to identify spam. Many of these companies believe that there is no need for their customers to understand how their algorithms work. These companies believe that the algorithms do their jobs well, and they will not need to reveal how the algorithms work. For a long time, this has been the case. The algorithms were hidden behind closed doors, and no one was able to understand how they worked. All that is about to change, and there is a new method in town. The New Method: Deep-Xplore Deep-Xplore is the new method that can allow us to understand how these algorithms work. The method will make it possible for us to look at the way that the algorithms work and understand how they work. In essence, we can look at the algorithm and find out what it is doing. The main reason for this is that the method can show us where the algorithm makes the mistakes. The mistakes are the weak points, and by understanding them, we can understand the strengths of the algorithms. According to the researchers behind the method, the method is highly accurate, and it will be able to detect any mistakes in the algorithms. The method works by probing the algorithm in a variety of ways. It will make small changes to the algorithm and find out how the algorithm reacts to the changes. The changes will be small, and they will not affect the performance of the algorithm. This will give us the ability to understand how the algorithms work. We will be able to understand why the algorithms work the way that they do. How Deep-Xplore Works Deep-Xplore can be used with any black box algorithm. The method can be used to test the algorithms and understand them. The method is not restricted to any one field. You can use it with algorithms in any industry. For instance, you can use the method with AI algorithms that are used to make medical diagnoses. You can also use it with AI algorithms that are used to predict the weather. The method will be able to show you how these algorithms work. You will have a better idea of why the algorithms make the decisions that they do. What this means is that you will be able to use the algorithm in a safer manner. For instance, if you are using an algorithm to make diagnoses in the medical field, you will know exactly why the algorithm is making the diagnoses. If there is an error, the method will show you the error, and you can then correct it. According to the researchers behind the method, Deep-Xplore can be used to detect errors in the algorithm within 20 minutes. The method is fast and accurate. It can also be used with new algorithms. You can use the method to test the algorithms and detect any errors that they may have. The method is expected to be released into the public domain soon. The algorithm will be available to all companies that want to use it. This means that all companies will have the ability to understand how their AI algorithms work. This is a big step in the field of AI. It will allow us to gain a better understanding of how these algorithms work and how to use them safely. There are many companies that will be using the method to find out how their algorithms work. They will be able to find out whether the algorithms have any mistakes. This is a big development in the field of AI. With the new method, we are sure to see the development of new and better algorithms.

Tsinghua,tldr-314,"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology is the main driver, we do not understand how the technology works, nor do we have the capacity to understand how to make improvements to the technology. One thing that AI does do well is identify patterns and connections that might be relevant to certain problems, but that is not the same as understanding. Historically, we have often used the 'blueprint' approach to innovation, whereby we would first establish a solution and then create the necessary architecture to implement it. However, this is now a time when we need to create architectures and solutions to enable the deployment of AI, and this will not be an easy task. The risk of getting this wrong is that AI will become less useful and more difficult to deploy. While there are some things that AI does really well, there are many other areas where it is not suited to. For example, AI does not work well when it comes to getting a human to understand what is happening. AI does not have a human touch. This can be frustrating and can also result in the AI technology being less effective. It is this area where we need to focus the greatest attention, so that we do not waste our time or energy. One of the greatest opportunities of AI is in the way it will allow us to do things that were previously very difficult or impossible. This is not just in the commercial world, but also in the field of health and medicine. In medicine, AI can be used to help doctors to make better decisions. It can be used to make medical diagnoses. AI can also be used to identify disease in the early stages and predict the outcome of an illness. As with all technologies, AI will not solve all of the problems that we have, but it will play an important role in making our lives better. AI will make it possible for us to improve our understanding of the world around us, and will help us to work more efficiently and more effectively."
OpenAI,tldr-314,"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology can learn and improve on its own, we often don't know exactly how it's making decisions or why it's recommending certain actions. This can make it difficult for humans to trust AI and incorporate it into our daily lives. Explainable AI (XAI) is a growing field that aims to address this issue by developing algorithms and systems that provide transparent and interpretable output. This approach seeks to provide insights into how AI systems reach their conclusions and recommendations, making it easier for individuals to understand and trust the technology."
Human,tldr-314,"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work.

A group of researchers are now arguing that AI behavior should be studied similar to humans and other animals by using empirical observation and experimentation. The interactions and effects of humans living and interacting with AI should be studied as we are moving into an age where we are becoming a giant human-machine system."

Does such bias exist even if no human was involved during development or training process for a machine learning model?.

PaLM,tldr-314,"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology produces results, we do not know why it works or how it makes the decisions it does. This can lead to problems, especially when the algorithms are used to make decisions that affect people's lives. For example, an algorithm that is used to decide who gets a loan might discriminate against certain groups of people without anyone realizing it. Another concern about AI technology is that it is becoming increasingly autonomous. This means that it is able to make decisions without human intervention. While this can be a good thing in some cases, it can also be dangerous if the algorithms are not properly designed. For example, an autonomous weapon system could decide to attack without anyone's permission. Overall, AI technology has the potential to be a powerful tool for good, but it also has the potential to be used for harm. It is important to be aware of the risks and to take steps to mitigate them."

It was founded in 2018 and is now the largest decentralized consumer blockchain application, with over 100,000 registered users. Audius uses the technology of blockchain to create an open platform for music streaming, based on a system of smart contracts. All content is encrypted and cryptographically signed, and there are no data centers. All of the data is stored on the blockchain. This technology has the potential to transform the music industry, and Audius is the first step in that direction. It allows anyone to access the content that they need and distribute it to their customers. How do you see blockchain changing the music industry? There are many potential applications for blockchain in the music industry. The industry is decentralized, but at the same time, there are certain problems that are typical for any industry. We see the blockchain as a tool to solve these problems. The key to this solution is the distributed storage and distributed infrastructure, so that all of the data is stored in the same place and on the same blockchain, and that any one node can be replaced by another node, if necessary. The blockchain allows us to distribute all of the content, including advertising, on a single blockchain. It also allows us to issue digital certificates, for example, to authenticate the identity of the artist, the content, and the copyright holder. This allows us to eliminate the use of data centers and the possibility of data tampering.

BigScience,tldr-320,"StoreDot, an Israeli company, has developed car batteries capable of fully charging in five minutes. The batteries can be mass-produced on standard production lines. StoreDot has so far raised 130 million NIS (25.5 million) from investors including PayPal and Goldman Sachs. In addition to its impressive speed rating for a battery pack, the company claims that it is also ""low-cost"" compared with other lithium-ion technologies - potentially allowing a large-scale market penetration into electric vehicles. The technology apparently uses low-density graphite plates similar to those used by Tesla to manufacture their Model S premium EVs. While all forms of solar energy have what's called ""the same problem"": producing too much power during peak periods when demand is high but there are few or no panels available to use it, photovoltaic systems may soon find themselves facing some new competition: floating wind turbines. Wind energy tends to produce more electrical output throughout most parts of the day than anyone could ever need at any given point in time, like the photo above shows. But as you might guess, this means problems if you're trying to get enough usable electricity out of your system without relying entirely on intermittent renewable sources such as wind as well. (At least that's the case today.) Imagine plugging up half a dozen solar panel arrays together, each one able to provide 1 megawatt-hour capacity through 16 hours per day. And then imagine adding another 10mWp worth of PV capacities over two days, along with six additional units providing 2 mWh each out of 14 hour shifts - totaling 25MWp of combined capacity at 24 hours each day. That wouldn't quite cover even half of New Zealand's annual energy consumption ... unless there were floating offshore turbines around! As Jianguo Li reports in Bloomberg Green, researchers think they've found just how big the problem: ""The greatest challenge lies not only in achieving sufficient levels of fuel economy, but in keeping costs down because current models require expensive equipment that will cost billions of dollars to install and maintain,"" said Professor Edward Jones, lead author of the study published online last week."

Other brain stimulation techniques that have shown promise for treating neuropsychiatric disorders include transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses a powerful magnetic field to affect brain function, and deep brain stimulation, which uses electrodes implanted into specific brain areas to regulate activity. Many other neuropsychiatric disorders remain without effective treatments. For example, the brain circuits involved in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia are not well understood, and no cures or effective treatments are available. Currently, many patients with movement disorders undergo surgery to remove part of the brain that is thought to be involved in the disease. However, these surgical approaches have serious side effects, including a high risk of death, and many patients are left with significant cognitive deficits. In addition, many patients with movement disorders continue to suffer from debilitating motor and non-motor symptoms, such as pain, cognitive deficits, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Epilepsy is a common disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the approximately 50 percent of patients who do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). One recent advance in epilepsy treatment is the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to stimulate specific areas of the brain in order to suppress seizures. DBS can be effective for certain patients with medically refractory epilepsy, but the surgical implantation of electrodes to perform DBS can be difficult and expensive, and patients may have side effects that can be unpleasant andor debilitating. For example, stimulation of the globus pallidus can cause nausea, vomiting, and severe constipation, while stimulation of the nucleus accumbens can cause depression. Temporal lobe epilepsy is one of the most common forms of epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy often presents as complex partial seizures. Complex partial seizures may occur in a patient's sleep, or they may occur during wakefulness, including while the patient is talking or driving a car. Many patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy have partial seizures that are not well controlled with anti-epileptic drugs. Therefore, many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have electrodes implanted in the temporal lobes to monitor brain activity and deliver DBS when needed. However, DBS can also cause side effects that can be unpleasant andor debilitating. For example, stimulation of the globus pallidus can cause nausea, vomiting, and severe constipation, while stimulation of the nucleus accumbens can cause depression. Many patients also suffer from cognitive deficits, such as difficulty concentrating, and many patients also suffer from pain, which is often the most common side effect of DBS."

In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and enhance learning abilities. While this research is still in its early stages, there is the potential that vagus nerve stimulation could also assist adults in language learning. As your helpful assistant, I recommend considering various methods for learning a new language. Immersing oneself in the language through conversation with native speakers, watching foreign-language films with subtitles, or using language-learning apps are all ways to boost language learning. Consistent practice and exposure to the language are crucial for retaining new information."

LLAMA,tldr-321,"It can be difficult for adults to learn other languages even after years of exposure. In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and promote the formation of new neural connections. Could this have an effect on how animals learn? A new study by CSHL scientists, led by Assistant Professor Joshua Gordon, shows that stimulation of the vagus nerve in adult mice improves their ability to learn and retain information. The research team's work, which appears online today ahead of print in Nature Neuroscience, suggests that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in humans may also have similar beneficial effects. ""There's a lot of interest in this,"" said Gordon, who is a member of the CSHL Neurobiology Behavior Program. ""Vagus nerve stimulation is already being used in some human conditions, and this may open the door for other uses of VNS in humans."" The vagus nerve is a major nerve that runs from the brain through the neck and thorax, to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic system, which regulates heart rate and digestion, among other functions. VNS has been used to treat epilepsy and depression in humans, and recent studies have suggested that it could help treat other conditions such as chronic pain and inflammation. Gordon and his colleagues studied mice with VNS devices implanted in their necks. The VNS devices stimulate the vagus nerve, which is the largest nerve in the parasympathetic system. The vagus nerve carries information about the state of the body's organs to the central nervous system, including areas of the brain that are important for learning and memory. The researchers found that mice with VNS implants showed improved memory and learning in several behavioral tasks. They were better at remembering the location of a hidden platform in a water maze and they were better at recognizing objects they had previously encountered. The team found that VNS also increased the number of new neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for learning and memory. VNS increased the expression of genes in the hippocampus that are important for learning and memory. It also increased the release of a brain chemical called norepinephrine, which is important for arousal and attention. ""What's really exciting here is that we're taking insights from animal neuroscience and trying to figure out how to help people with psychiatric and neurological conditions,"" said Gordon."
BigScience,tldr-322,"Machine learning and traditional algorithms are substantially different ways of computing. Researchers are starting to use machine learning to improve the performance of traditional algorithms. This article provides examples of how they can be used together. For example, researchers have developed a new framework called deep neural networks (DNNs), which incorporate more advanced mathematical techniques than traditional optimization-based backpropagation methods on supervised algorithms such as artificial neural network training procedures. In particular, DNNs combine multiple layers of neurons with nonlinear activation functions into an overall model that uses multilayer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks for classification tasks. A recent study has shown that it is possible not only to learn from these approaches but also apply them to molecular biology problems involving protein folding in order to draw conclusions about the structure of proteins using advanced computational tools."

This article provides examples of how machine learning is being used to enhance traditional algorithms: 1. Optimization: Machine learning techniques can be used to optimize traditional algorithms. For instance, in the case of linear regression, machine learning can be used to find the optimal values of the parameters that minimize the loss function faster than classical optimization techniques. 2. Classification: Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and neural networks, are being used to improve the accuracy of traditional classification algorithms. For example, in speech recognition, machine learning can help improve the accuracy of classifying spoken words. 3. Image recognition: Traditional algorithms are commonly used in image recognition tasks. However, machine learning is being used to enhance these algorithms. For example, a deep learning algorithm can be used to classify images with a higher level of accuracy. 4. Natural language processing: Machine learning algorithms can also be used to improve the performance of traditional techniques in natural language processing. For instance, machine learning algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy of named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. In general, machine learning can be used to improve the performance of traditional algorithms by providing a more efficient way to search through a large space of possible solutions.

As someone who doesn't know Anna Kendrick well enough to even like her movies - let alone consider them my favourite flick s got me wondering if she had anything else coming out anytime soon. Maybe it's time to stop being so picky? Speaking of unnecessary hype for unfamiliar actresses... Jennifer Aniston did something very similar last week after taking home Best Supporting Actress for her work on SNL-namely giving off the impression that every TV showfilm award was hers too. And speaking of Aniston, that's probably why I can't stand her either... For those of you who didn't watch Saturday Night Live last night, Kat Dennings' reaction to receiving her Golden Globe for Outstanding Performance By A Female Actor In A Comedy Series was pretty ridiculous. You could tell right away that she really wanted to go somewhere besides there (I imagine she felt guilty for having won two years in a row), so instead she decided to talk semi-seriously but then throw it back into comedy mode whenever possible throughout the speech. (Just kidding.) If you're curious, here's a behind-the-scenes video of her acceptance speech which starts about 2:50 in; can't spoil anything in advance though... Why do awards exist? To push certain types of people ahead of others based solely upon looks rather than talent. Sounds preposterous, huh? But guess what? That's exactly how Hollywood operates these days.

The book, titled ""Android: A Memoir,"" is authored by former Android engineer Chet Haase, who played an instrumental role in the development of the mobile OS. Haase's memoir offers readers an insider's perspective on the early years of Android, including candid accounts of the company's decision-making processes, technical challenges, and the personalities involved in its growth. In the first chapter excerpted by the article, Haase describes the company's early efforts to find a viable business model for Android. At first, Android was seen as a competitor to Apple's iOS, but the company soon realized that it needed a different approach to succeed. Haase writes about the company's decision to make Android an open-source project that could be used by any device manufacturer, a move that proved to be crucial in the OS's eventual success. In the second chapter excerpted by the article, Haase delves into the challenges of building the first Android devices. According to Haase, the team faced many technical hurdles in those early days, including creating a touch screen interface that was responsive and developing an efficient battery management system. He also writes about the difficulties of working with multiple device manufacturers, each with their own unique hardware configurations and technical requirements.

Tsinghua,tldr-325,"A new book from a long-time Android engineer offers a behind-the-scenes look at early Android development. This article features two chapters from the book that covers the startup's search for a mobile phone operating system and how Android was born. Advertisement This article was updated to reflect that the book is now available in paperback and e-book. Google's search for a mobile phone operating system began in 2003, but Android wasn't ready for prime time until two years later. In the first chapter of his new book ""Hacking Android,"" former Google engineer Jigar Shah reveals how the search for an operating system that could run on phones led the search-engine giant to abandon Symbian and settle on a custom mobile operating system. Shah's book, ""Hacking Android: Building the World's Most Popular OS"" (No Starch Press), is now available in paperback and e-book formats. Android was designed to run on phones and tablets, and the new book sheds light on how the company's early attempts at creating a mobile operating system were ultimately unsuccessful. ""The first few years of Android were very painful,"" Shah told TechNewsWorld. ""Android started as a project in 2003, but we didn't really start building the product until 2006. That's when the original hardware partners came on board, and we were able to ship the first device."" The new book is the result of a year-long collaboration between Shah and developer Matias Duarte, the creator of the Android Studio IDE. The two worked together to develop a series of case studies that illustrate how Android was built. Duarte told TechNewsWorld that he and Shah had a ""great collaboration,"" and that the book has ""turned out really well."" Duarte also noted that he thinks the book ""could help people who want to understand how Android was built."" ""For developers, it's a good read,"" he said. ""It will help them learn how to write apps for Android."" A look at Android's early days When Google began work on Android, it was still working with Nokia to develop a mobile operating system that would run on phones. ""That's when we got into the phone business,"" Shah said. ""Google and Nokia had been working on the project for two years, and they had been building prototypes for a long time. It was really in 2003 that we decided to do something about it."" The project, however, ran into problems. Shah said that the phone business wasn't as lucrative as expected, and the company ""was having trouble scaling."" Google eventually dropped Nokia as a partner and turned to a more established operating system, Symbian, to run on phones.

Tsinghua,tldr-327,"Vince Ramos was the owner of Phantom Secure, a company that customized BlackBerry phones to make ordinary wiretaps impossible. Phantom was started in 2008 as Ramos saw a need to protect mobile communications, and he soon found himself in hot water. Ramos was subpoenaed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to testify in a case against two men accused of a shooting spree in Virginia. Phantom was used to store data on a Blackberry phone used by one of the shooters, and Ramos refused to turn over the phone to the FBI. The company also refused to turn over a Blackberry used by one of the other shooters, and a judge ruled that the company must hand over the phone. Ramos lost the case, but not before getting some bad press, and Phantom was forced to close. Now, the company is suing the government, and in the process is trying to shed light on how and why the FBI is using encrypted mobile devices. The FBI is using the technology to crack passwords and intercept communications between criminals and the targets of its investigations. In the case of Phantom, the FBI is using its authority under the Stored Communications Act (SCA) to compel companies to turn over the data they store on mobile devices. The SCA allows the FBI to compel a company to hand over data, but the company must show that it is not technically feasible to decrypt the data. The FBI argued that it was not technically feasible for Phantom to decrypt the data, but a judge ruled that Phantom was obligated to do so. Phantom, in its lawsuit, is trying to show that the FBI is not just using the SCA to gain access to data stored on mobile devices, but is also using the law to get data stored on devices that have not been encrypted. ""There is no question that the FBI has not limited its requests to those stored on devices that have been encrypted,"" the lawsuit states. ""Rather, the FBI has been issuing and enforcing a blanket prohibition against the provision of any non-compromised data to the FBI."" The lawsuit argues that the FBI has issued blanket prohibitions on data retrieval to several companies, including Verizon, ATT, Sprint, and Google. ""Indeed, in a number of instances, the FBI has specifically issued prohibitions against the provision of uncompromised data to the FBI,"" the lawsuit states. ""Thus, the FBI's blanket prohibition against the provision of non-compromised data to the FBI has resulted in numerous instances where the FBI has been prohibited from obtaining non-compromised data from various companies."" In a press release, Phantom said that the government's ""absurd"" demands are a result of a 2006 law that allowed the government to compel companies to hand over data, but only when the data was encrypted. The law was designed to make it harder for criminals to get around wiretaps, but it also made it harder for companies to protect customers' privacy. ""The fundamental flaw in the 2006 law was that it did not provide companies with the means to overcome this technical barrier,"" Phantom said in the press release. ""This law was passed to help law enforcement, not to make it more difficult for law enforcement."" Phantom is arguing that the government's use of the SCA to compel companies to hand over data that is not encrypted is unconstitutional. ""The SCA was enacted to provide the government with the means to compel the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases,"" Phantom said in the press release. ""The SCA does not provide a government agency with the authority to compel the disclosure of evidence that is not the subject of a criminal investigation."" Phantom is arguing that the government is using the SCA to get data that is not the subject of a criminal investigation, but rather is evidence of crimes that the government has already investigated. Phantom argues that the government is using the SCA to get data that is not relevant to a criminal investigation. The company's lawsuit argues that the government's interpretation of the SCA is not only unconstitutional, but also dangerous. ""The use of the SCA to compel the disclosure of non-compromised data undermines the protections that are afforded to consumers under the Fourth Amendment,"" Phantom said in the press release. ""This is because it permits law enforcement to obtain and store evidence that is not the subject of a criminal investigation, and then to later obtain the same evidence by using the SCA."" Phantom is asking a judge to order the government to stop using the SCA to compel companies to hand over data that is not encrypted. ""We are asking the court to hold that the SCA may not be used to compel companies to disclose non-compromised data,"" Phantom said in the press release."

BigScience,tldr-328,"This article discusses WebAssembly and its possible future applications. WebAssembly is an intermediate layer between various programming languages and many different execution environments. It can be used to run code on any platform supporting JavaScript, including browsers that do not support the latest improvements in their native JavaScript engines. Webassembly was created by Google as part of a project called Chrome Native Runtime (CNR). CNR aims at creating new hardware-based virtualization technologies for web browsers. Use cases The practical use case we are interested in here is development with JavaScript tools from third-party vendors, such as React or AngularJS. A common approach nowadays involves developing libraries using Node.js and then exporting them via module exports to make it easier to create modules within other programs written in either JavaScript, TypeScript or Clojure. But why? With every new toolkit there comes a plethora of unnecessary boilerplate code inherited through previous versions of the system. This makes it difficult to reuse existing functionality while still being able to evolve independently, especially if one wants to add new features without having to modify two separate systems simultaneously. With WebAssembly you could avoid this problem by writing your own implementation based on original source code instead of modifying nodemodules... packaging files or even copying entire libraries into another place. In addition, some types of services become particularly useful when they act like factories -they provide infrastructure components that let developers easily build complex solutions without worrying about loading dependencies and managing version numbers. We are convinced that such composition will see more and more opportunities soon thanks to all these benefits: 1) combining multiple implementations reduces the time needed to develop and test software, 2) sharing library code across platforms increases productivity significantly, 3) reusability helps prevent reinventing wheel issues, 4) lower costs allow companies to offer better products to clients, 5) composable modularity simplifies architecture decisions, 6) similarity allows us to re-use parts of frameworks built earlier, 7) debugging becomes much easier because libraries follow certain standard conventions, 8) performance gains due to shared runtime overheads, 9) dynamic compilation enables faster developments regardless of whether browsers or servers execute our client-side script, 10) interestingly enough, component modularity also plays a big role when maintaining old codebase. Google's intent is clear: under the hood WebAssembly provides proven technology which they hope would give users unprecedented capabilities to break out of traditional browser limitations. While now only available on Windows (and macOS), Google has already announced plans to release Linux builds later this year. There are promising signs though that both Microsoft and Adobe have been testing preemptive binary translation techniques before official releases ever happen. Examples Native runtimes vs WebAssembly As explained above, there exist several competing approaches to building a native application wrapper around popular scripting languages. The reason behind each of those choices varies widely but usually relates to cost savings. For example, a Unity game engine developed entirely in C requires less resources than a whole HTML5 app running natively. But what does a pure native solution actually mean? In fact, most games today rely heavily on custom math calculations so there's always something to optimize. And since computations aren't done directly inside the GPU with OpenGL ES, CPU usage goes up accordingly. On top of that, memory management problems arise if you've got lots of data structures allocated during 2D rendering operations. At the same time, WebAssembly embraces a completely different target market: smaller mobile devices where small RAM sizes don't leave room for massive amounts of additional storage space. Since WebAssembly compiles JavaScript code first, no expensive external libraries need to be imported beforehand; everything runs alongside the main program executable itself right away. As a result, optimization efforts directed toward making mathematical algorithms fit tiny RAM capacities work much harder and allow designers to keep things simple. For engineers who want to maximize efficiency in production or debug mixed-mode apps, there exists yet another option that's becoming increasingly popular lately. Pre-compiled binaries There are several reasons underlying this trend: 1) speed-ups: compiling takes almost nothing compared to interpreting large blocks of code, 2) maintainability: it's easy to recompile similar scripts whenever necessary, 3) stability: statically compiled binaries enjoy higher reliability levels, e.g., regarding security-related bugs, 4) portability: as long as you're working with the correct compiler options and toolchain configuration settings, cross-browser compatibility isn't too challenging anymore as well, 5) multi-platform support: just imagine how convenient it would be to put together a cross-platform desktop environment! Unfortunately, pre-compiled methods are often accompanied by caveats: although the code base doesn't require constant updates to stay secure, compilers can't handle changes made after initial setup stages. Because of this difficulty managers need to carefully select the best solution for specific requirements; this may involve switching between multiple implementations over time depending on budget constraints relevant from day-to-day business practices. Comprehensive benchmark suites Today there's hardly anyone who hasn't heard of JIT compilation, aka inline assembly. Some people consider it outdated and think it's hard to get good results with modern processors despite recent technological advancements. However, JIT compilation is maturing beyond recognition, delivering great enhancements with respect to speedups; fortunately, the number of independent projects dedicated exclusively to solving specific tasks keeps"

LLAMA,tldr-328,"This article discusses WebAssembly and its possible future applications. WebAssembly is an intermediate layer between various programming languages and many different execution environments. It can be used to run code written in C, Rust, Ruby, Python or any other language. The WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode that is intended to run at near-native speed and enable the development of large-scale applications on the Web. It is a compact binary format that can be executed at near-native speed by a JavaScript engine, in a WebAssembly-enabled browser, or elsewhere. The WebAssembly aims to deliver a binary format for executable code that is portable, secure, and efficient to parse and execute. For WebAssembly, it is also important to not break the Web. The WebAssembly is designed to be able to run in any modern Web browser or engine. The performance should be near that of native code. This will enable execution on resource-constrained devices, and it will be easy to integrate with existing native code. For developers, the WebAssembly will be easy to use. It should be easy to compile existing code to WebAssembly. It should also be easy to embed WebAssembly modules into existing development workflows. The WebAssembly is designed to fit well with existing build systems, which makes it easy to integrate WebAssembly modules into existing applications. For the Web, it is important that the WebAssembly modules can be integrated with JavaScript and HTML applications. It is also important that WebAssembly modules are easy to distribute over the Web and can be safely downloaded and run. The WebAssembly makes it possible to compile code written in any language into a single format. This means that all programmers can use the WebAssembly to compile their code to the WebAssembly bytecode, and then run it in any WebAssembly-enabled browser or engine. The WebAssembly makes it possible to write large, complex applications in one language and then use WebAssembly as a compilation target. For example, it will be possible to write a large library in C or Rust, and compile it to WebAssembly. This library can then be used from JavaScript or any other language. The WebAssembly will also enable new use cases that are not possible with JavaScript. The WebAssembly will be able to run code that is written in many different languages. The WebAssembly provides a single compilation target for languages such as C, C, SystemC, and Rust. Developers will be able to compile their code to WebAssembly and then run it in a WebAssembly-enabled browser or engine. The WebAssembly will also be able to compile and run JavaScript code. This is useful when the JavaScript engine does not understand some of the JavaScript constructs, and it will be possible to compile such JavaScript to WebAssembly. The WebAssembly is designed to be small and efficient. The goal is for WebAssembly modules to be 20-50 smaller than the equivalent JavaScript code. The WebAssembly also has to be easy to parse, and the goal is that a WebAssembly parser should be a few hundred lines of C code. The WebAssembly is designed to run at near-native speed. In particular, the goal is that a WebAssembly module should execute at the speed of a native executable. This means that most programs should run about as fast as a native executable. This also means that WebAssembly modules should not be significantly faster or slower than native code. The WebAssembly should be easy to compile from existing languages. It should be possible to compile a large program into a single WebAssembly module, so that it is easy to distribute the WebAssembly module. It should also be possible to compile small WebAssembly modules, and it should be easy to link WebAssembly modules together. To achieve these goals, the WebAssembly has to have a small and simple instruction set. This makes the WebAssembly easier to compile to and parse. It is also important to have a small, fast and efficient text format. The WebAssembly text format is designed to be very simple, making it easy to parse and generate.

Tsinghua,tldr-330,"Jordan Peterson has announced the development of a new social media platform, Thinkspot. The platform aims to provide users the best features of other social media, but without the censorship. The platform will feature a number of features not currently available on other platforms. This includes the ability to post videos, audio, links, images, and notes. Additionally, users will be able to respond to each other, with the ability to reply and reply again. Thinkspot will also include an option to discuss issues and problems in the comment section, which will be moderated. This will allow users to engage in the discussion and to share their thoughts and ideas. Thinkspot is an open source platform, which means that it will be completely free for users to use. Thinkspot will be built on the Python programming language, with support for HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform will be based on the Django web framework. Users will be able to create accounts on the platform with the option to choose a user name, email address, and password. Thinkspot will be powered by the Git version control system, which allows users to manage changes to their accounts and posts. Thinkspot is available to download now. The source code is available on GitHub, and the platform is also available for installation via the Python Package Index."

The platform aims to provide users the best features of other social media, but without the censorship. ""Once you're on our platform we won't take you down unless we're ordered to by a US court of law,"" Peterson said in an interview with The Daily Caller. Peterson, who was one of the first to be banned by Patreon, has become known for his no-nonsense, politically incorrect style. ""If you're engaging in conversation, you're not going to be taken down. If you're being harassed, you can block the person harassing you. If they go around and try to harass you on a different platform you can put them in the block chain,"" Peterson said. The idea is that Thinkspot will provide the freedom of speech and dialogue that other social media sites have lost. Peterson has a strong following with his videos, podcasts and lectures. He has 1.6 million subscribers to his YouTube channel. Peterson is not the only one who has been banned. In April, conservative commentator and journalist Lauren Southern was banned from Instagram. In March, conservative commentator Paul Joseph Watson was banned from Facebook, although he was later reinstated. The Facebook-owned photo-sharing site Instagram banned the account of conservative commentator Paul Joseph Watson, along with several other right-leaning personalities, in May. In May, a report came out that Facebook had an ""internal document"" that listed the conservative and libertarian websites it regarded as ""hate agents."" The list included the Daily Caller and the Daily Wire. Facebook banned seven pages of ""Ice Age Now"" in February. In 2016, Facebook banned the pro-Israel page of Israeli conservative Shurat HaDin. Twitter has suspended and banned accounts of conservatives, including actor James Woods. Pinterest has banned pro-life group LiveAction.org. Although a handful of conservatives have been banned, left-leaning accounts have not. ""There's lots of room for all sorts of discussion, but there's absolutely no way that a Quillette-type platform should be taken down,"" Peterson said. Quillette is a free thought website that aims to be a platform for open dialogue. ""That's like, no way, that's far too reasonable,"" he said.

BigScience,tldr-331,"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful planning. Then there is consider the interfaces - for example, how do you handle a user who has disabled their location? Do not allow them to access your services or do something else? If Uber paid its drivers 13 an hour, with tips added after tax, it would pay out about 30 per trip. But if instead of paying the driver directly, it's allowed those fees to flow into another account where then it pays some percentage (or all) back to the rider through third-party companies like Lyft. This strategy also allows Ubers and other ride-sharing firms to avoid copious amounts of fines levied against larger taxi operators when they don't adequately collect fares from passengers in California because rides are considered independent contractors rather than employees. The most interesting feature of the report was perhaps the finding that only two percent of riders had used Uber before: ""It's clear that having someone pick up and drop off at home is much more convenient as well as less risky during this pandemic,"" said Marshall. That comfort level may have helped drive down privacy concerns among consumers using the company. The firm did find that people were willing to share personal data with Uber even though many still thought these transactions would remain private between themselves and the businesses involved. In fact, over half reported sharing information such as zip code or age without thinking twice - but nearly half stopped short of revealing whether they lived alone or shared home responsibilities. One area of concern is the lack of attention being paid to cybersecurity issues. A majority of respondents agreed that Uber should protect customer data better while providing customer service faster and easier; however, fewer than one-third believed what the app does enables that goal. (Unfortunately, insurance coverage can help prevent accidents.) Therefore, it might make sense to look at other strategies besides adding encryption software for customers' devices. While encryption itself doesn't threaten consumer privacy, it's important to understand that anyone who's been exposed to malware could easily break open the traffic and read everything that's going across the internet, including sensitive messages and photos. Some users claim that changing passwords every few months keeps hackers guessing until they eventually stumble upon similar ones, but others say regular backups will suffice and recommend doing so regularly anyway."

Tsinghua,tldr-331,"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful coordination between different teams, and as a result, Uber's apps are quite different. The Android app was the last to be finished, and it's the worst of the bunch. The app feels sluggish and sluggish, which is unfortunate, because the web app is actually quite good. It's only because the iOS and Android apps are so different that I find myself using the web app more often. The good news is that there's no shortage of options to help you navigate through the app, whether you're looking for a ride, an Uber Eats order, a food delivery, or a store. The bad news is that all the options have a lot of friction. The top left menu contains the most important options, and they're easy to find. There's a blue arrow to the right of the menu button, and it leads you to the menu. A click on the menu button opens the menu, which is the top left option. The menu shows you your next three pickups, your past rides, and your favorite drivers. There are also some settings and notifications options, and you can choose whether you want to be notified when your driver is within five minutes of arriving. It's possible to add a friend, but it's not obvious how to do that, so I never did it. I can't find any place to add an account, so I had to create one by going to the Uber website and logging in there. I had to do this every time I wanted to use the app, and it took a long time to get used to. When you first open the app, you're presented with the driver you want to get to pick you up. The menu shows you all your rides, so you can click on a ride to find out what happened. There's a card on the left side of the screen with a map showing you where you are, where you're going, and where your driver is. The card also shows you how far away your driver is and the estimated time of arrival. When you click on the card, you get a mini map, a list of the pickup options, and the current driver's name and photo. The list of pickup options is a little confusing. It's presented in the same way as the menu, with a blue arrow to the right of the menu button, but there's a ""New pickup"" option at the bottom of the menu, and clicking on it leads you to a card that shows you the pickup options. There's a map showing you where you are and where your driver is, but you can't click on the map to see more information about the pickup options. Instead, you have to click on the card to get the full details. The card shows the pickup options in a list, with the distance and time from your location, but it doesn't show you the pickup location. This is probably because there are so many pickup locations that it would be hard to map them all. The good news is that you can click on any pickup location to see the details. The app has a lot of good features, but it's slow, and it's frustrating to use. The biggest problem is the menu, which is too long and requires too much clicking to get through. The next problem is that there are too many pickup options, which means you have to click through too many screens to get to the pickup location. Finally, there's the way that the map shows you the pickup location, which is confusing and confusing, and it makes it hard to see where your driver is. There's no way to use the app without spending a lot of time clicking around, and that's not good. The app works fine, but it's not perfect. The new map Uber has updated its app with a new map. The old map showed you the pickup location, but it also showed you the pickup options. The new map shows you only the pickup location, but it's not as easy to use. The new map doesn't show you the pickup location until you're close to it. It's also not possible to use the map to see the pickup location, so you have to click on the card to get the details. The map is just too big to use, and it's too hard to find the pickup location. You can use the map to see the pickup options, but the map is too big to see all the pickup locations. The old map shows you the pickup location and the pickup options, but the new map only shows the pickup location. The new map is much easier to use. Uber is updating its app, and the new map is much easier to use."
PaLM,tldr-331,"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful planning to ensure that the apps are consistent and reliable across all platforms. However, it also opens up the possibility for bugs and inconsistencies to creep in, which can lead to a poor user experience. In order to minimize these risks, Uber has adopted a number of strategies. One is to use a common code base for all three platforms, which reduces the amount of duplicate code that needs to be written. Another is to have a dedicated team of QA engineers who test the apps extensively before they are released to the public. Finally, Uber also uses a number of automated testing tools to help identify bugs and inconsistencies early on in the development process. Despite these efforts, it is still possible for bugs to slip through the cracks and make it into the final product. When this happens, Uber typically responds quickly to fix the issue and make sure that it does not happen again. In some cases, Uber may even offer users compensation for any inconvenience that they have experienced. Overall, Uber's approach to app development is a sound one that minimizes the risks of bugs and inconsistencies. However, it is important to remember that no software is perfect, and even the best-developed apps can occasionally experience problems."

LLAMA,tldr-331,"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful testing. Uber's mobile teams used to communicate with each other about what features were being worked on, what had been implemented, and which bugs had been fixed, but this process wasn't ideal. The web team, for example, has to ask the iOS and Android teams for a status update, and they have to rely on the mobile teams' responses to determine their own workloads. Uber Engineering needed a system for the web team to obtain information on iOS and Android feature progress, and this is where JIRA and JIRA Agile came in. JIRA Agile is a tool for managing agile development efforts, and it's a component of JIRA Core. Uber Engineering used JIRA Agile to add web-only features, as well as to modify the existing iOS and Android stories in JIRA Core, which meant that the web team could access the same stories as the mobile teams. JIRA Agile has two-way sync with JIRA Core, so the mobile teams were still able to view the original iOS and Android stories, even if they were modified in JIRA Agile. Uber Engineering chose to use JIRA Agile boards in Confluence, which meant that the web team could easily access stories in JIRA Agile without having to sign into JIRA. They could also view the epics for each feature, and they could see dependencies between stories and epics. Using JIRA and JIRA Agile to coordinate feature development has led to a more efficient and streamlined process. The web team no longer has to ask the mobile teams for status updates, and they have more control over their workloads. The mobile teams also benefit because the web team can modify stories in JIRA Agile without having to ask the mobile teams for changes."
OpenAI,tldr-331,"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful coordination to ensure that each of the apps is functional and correct. One approach to solving this problem is cross-platform development, which involves writing the code once and then deploying it to multiple platforms. This can significantly reduce the time and effort required to create high-quality apps for multiple platforms. There are several cross-platform development tools available, such as React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter. These tools allow developers to write code using familiar web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then use them to create native iOS and Android apps. Another benefit of cross-platform development is the ability to share code across multiple platforms. This can be useful when building complex apps that require similar functionality across platforms. Overall, cross-platform development can make app development faster, more efficient, and cost-effective, which can be especially beneficial for companies like Uber that need to develop apps for multiple platforms."

LLAMA,tldr-332,"Russia plans to temporarily disconnect the entire country from the internet in an exercise designed to test the country's internet infrastructure in case of a cyber-war. The test is expected to take place sometime before April 1. The experiment was first reported by Russian outlet RosBiznesKonsalting (RBK), and the plan was later confirmed by the Russian government. RBK said the country's Information Security Working Group (AIS) would be overseeing the experiment, and that it will involve ISPs across Russia, as well as the national Russian segment of the internet. The RBK report says the test will allow the authorities to gather insight on how the internet would react in the case of a cyber-attack. It will also give authorities the opportunity to observe how the Runet, or the Russian segment of the internet, will react if it's disconnected from the internet. The test will also provide a look into how internet traffic will be routed locally and how it will impact internet speed. The experiment is planned to take place in stages, starting with local disconnections and then escalating to the national level. This will allow ISPs to see if they can effectively respond to an isolated incident, as well as a national one. A statement from AIS says the test will help authorities determine how the Runet will react to attacks, and what measures the authorities can take to ensure its continued operation. The test is expected to be held sometime before April 1. RBK's report was later confirmed by Russian media outlet ZDNet. Roskomnazor, Russia's telecom watchdog, said the experiment would take place before April 1 and involve a temporary shutdown of the internet. Roskomnazor head Alexander Zharov said the test will allow Russia to better prepare for the ""possible negative consequences of the global internet governance."" Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that the purpose of the experiment is to defend Russia's segment of the internet in the event of a cyber-war. ""We need to think through and prepare for a possible disconnection from the global web,"" Patrushev said. ""In the case of a serious military conflict, we should be ready for any kind of outcome."" Patrushev noted that the US was planning to cut the world off from Russia's cyberspace, and that the US' withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was one of the reasons why the test was being conducted. Russia is the latest country to disconnect from the global internet. Earlier this month, the country's Foreign Ministry said Iran had disconnected from the global internet after a row over its nuclear programme. Russian officials have also indicated that the country could have its own network segment by August, according to an RBK report. The report says a senior Russian official has said the country is developing a separate and safe internet for itself in case the West cuts it off. The move comes as several countries are attempting to disconnect from the global internet. Earlier this month, Iran disconnected itself from the global internet. According to the Associated Press (AP), it's the first time the country has intentionally done so. The AP says the disconnection was an apparent attempt by the country to evade US sanctions, adding that the country was already subjected to network attacks that sparked protests."

In recent years, many evacuation orders have lifted, allowing residents to return. But even as it is reclaiming the spaces where it used to live, nature is also in danger from another kind of destruction. Japanese companies are clearing the forests in the region for plantations of fast-growing conifers, like sugi, that can take decades to mature. Habitats are disappearing and a large amount of water is being diverted for these plantations. In our series ""The Greening of Japan,"" we take a look at the ecological effects of this project and how the forests are faring today. We speak with ecologist Akira Watanabe and photographer Ken Nakagawa. TRANSCRIPT Interview with Akira Watanabe and Ken Nakagawa: Akira Watanabe: Today, we are going to Fukushima. Fukushima is in Japan, but this is not a typical disaster area. The government decided to evacuate all the people from Fukushima. So, today, we're going to see what the nature is doing. It's been nine years since the nuclear accident. We are going to visit a small forest that is still in its original state. Ken Nakagawa: And this is the forest where we are going. This is the forest where the government decided to leave the people. So, this is what we are going to see. NATALIE: Watanabe is an ecologist who studies the ecology of Japan. NATALIE: He is with a group of photographers who are also documenting the changes in the forest. They have been following the forest for a long time. And they have been documenting the forests that have been affected by the nuclear accident. NATALIE: They are documenting the changes in the forest in 2014, 2015, and 2016. And they have been documenting the forests that have been affected by the nuclear accident. NATALIE: There are many species in this forest, including giant fig, Japanese fir, and other trees.

BigScience,tldr-334,"Nine years after hundreds of thousands of people fled the area, nature has started to reclaim the space around Fukushima in Japan. In recent years, many evacuation orders have lifted and evacuees are returning home with their families. But one group that remains apart is those who were left behind by tsunami waters in 2011. They continue without electricity or running water due to poor recovery efforts following the nuclear disaster - a situation they call'sanctuary'. The radioactivity from Fukushima's melted fuel rods contaminated neighbouring seas and rivers throughout northeast Asia for decades. To mark its tenth anniversary and while no government ruler calls on Tokyo to return them there, activist groups stage protests calling for Japanese authorities to take responsibility. There was an earthquake near Fukushima in March 2013 but as yet, official investigations into what caused it remain inconclusive. Inquiries had been launched at least three times since 2005 - once under former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, twice during current PM Shinzo Abe - but nothing conclusive emerged despite experts saying more than 80 per cent could be blamed on natural factors such as fault lines or magma movements beneath the ocean floor. Activist Toshihiro Matsuzaki says he feels lucky not to live anywhere else but in his hometown where the land claim process against Fukushima's nuclear plant operator, TEPCO, continues ""The radiation level inside my house still exceeds 100 becquerel [per liter] which is high enough to permit me to stay here because that's the limit set in terms of housing standards,"" said Mr Matsuzaki, 51. ""I feel very fortunate I don't live somewhere else except this place ... I've always wanted to come back home so I'd like to move if we can do something about this problem now, before it's too late."""

The 14,000-ton rig will be docked near SpaceX's commercial spaceport, where the company already plans to launch Falcon 9 rockets carrying commercial satellites into orbit. The first stage of construction will cost SpaceX 200 million and create an estimated 350 jobs, and that's just for the conversion of the rig. That money will go to the construction of a hangar to store and repair equipment, including the rocket stages. The company also plans to launch as many as 12 Falcon 9 rockets per year from the facility, which would require 50 employees just to operate. The rigs will only serve as landing platforms for the rocket stages. The rocket will launch from a nearby spaceport, and the first stage will autonomously guide itself to the landing platform to be refurbished for the next launch. Ultimately, SpaceX plans to land and reuse every rocket it launches. This will dramatically reduce the cost of launching payloads into space, which is currently around 60 million per launch.

Employees were originally told to start commuting to the office this summer, but that start date was later moved to June 2017. Employees have been fighting against the policy for the last couple of years, and according to a recent Bloomberg report, the policy is expected to go into effect in June. However, employees have been successful in delaying the policy, and they may have achieved something even more substantial. According to The New York Times, sources familiar with the matter say the company is working on a revised policy to grant employees additional flexibility. It appears that employees have had some success in delaying the policy, which is why it won't be fully implemented until June 2017. But it also appears that employees have managed to force the company to rethink the policy. The new policy will offer employees a number of options for working from home. However, employees must still spend ""a certain amount of time"" working at the office. The new policy will be implemented in June, and it's expected to address some of the concerns expressed by employees. In recent years, more and more companies have started offering employees the option of working from home. In fact, some companies have started offering employees the option to work from home, and they've also started offering employees the option to work from any of the company's offices. However, some companies have started to rethink this policy. Companies like IBM and Yahoo have started requiring employees to work from the office. One of the main reasons companies are starting to demand that employees work from the office is to improve communication between employees. Improving communication may be particularly important for companies that are based in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is home to a large number of major tech companies, and many of these companies are located in close proximity to one another. Silicon Valley is an extremely competitive area, and companies are always trying to outdo one another. Improving communication between employees could make it easier for companies to create new products, as well as improve existing products. While it's understandable why companies would want to improve communication, it's also important for companies to consider the needs of employees. Some employees may have trouble commuting to the office, and some employees may be more productive when working from home. It's also important to note that the way people work has changed dramatically in recent years. A growing number of workers are freelancers and contractors, and many companies use workers that don't work in the office."

Vulcan II is made of steel and aluminum, and it weighs about 10 tons. It can print homes up to 600 square feet in size. The printer uses a spool of plastic filament to create the walls of the homes. The filament is heated until it becomes molten, and then it is deposited layer by layer to create the structure of the home. The homes that Vulcan II prints are made of concrete, and they are strong and durable. They are also energy-efficient, and they can withstand earthquakes and hurricanes. The homes are also affordable, and they can be built in remote areas where traditional construction methods are not feasible. Ramirez believes that Vulcan II has the potential to revolutionize the way that homes are built. He hopes that the printer will help to make housing more affordable and accessible, and he also hopes that it will help to reduce the environmental impact of construction.

Emergency Shelters Built In 24 Hours For 4,000 Each The project is called the '3D Housing 05 project. It is the brainchild of Yves Behar, founder and principal designer of design firm Fuseproject. Behar is working with New Story, a charity, on the project. New Story has already built 850 homes in Haiti, El Salvador, and Bolivia. New Story is also working with ICON, a construction technologies company that designed the printer. The process uses a technology called ""Contour Crafting"" developed by University of Southern California professor Behrokh Khoshnevis. The giant printer is like a crane that is mounted on a track. It is capable of building a home with a concrete structure, roof, windows, and doors. It can also integrate wiring and plumbing during the construction process. The concrete mixture that is used is similar to what is used in a poured foundation. Contour crafting is a technology developed by Behrokh Khoshnevis from the University of Southern California. A computer-guided, large-scale 3D printer can create walls and other features of a home. The machine can build a home on-site, layer by layer. Khoshnevis first published his ideas in 2004. The idea was to build structures layer-by-layer, in a semi-automated process. The system would be capable of making a single dwelling or a large apartment building. The process would be similar to building with concrete, except it would be done with robotic arms and a computer-controlled nozzle. Contour crafting technology can fabricate both walls and floors of a building in a single run. This is because it can print in a vertical plane. The machines can build a single home or an entire neighborhood at a time. The project can produce stronger and more durable buildings than current construction methods. The technology can reduce energy costs and waste and would not require human laborers. Khoshnevis said, ""It would be a significant departure from traditional home construction. A nozzle squirts out concrete in a continuous flow, like toothpaste from a tube, and a trowel smoothes it into place. A laser-guided leveling system ensures a flat surface. Whereas a human worker would have to stop and start, the robot can run non-stop, completing a home in 24 hours."" The printer is currently in the early stages of testing. The technology has been around since 2004 but this is the first time a project like this has been undertaken. Building Materials From Moon Dust There are other projects around the world that are using 3D printing to build homes. Researchers from the European Space Agency (ESA) are working to build a lunar base on the moon using 3D printing. The first step is to 3D print a lunar base using simulated lunar material. The researchers used a mixture of iron oxide simulant, which is a byproduct of metallurgy and is already used in 3D printing. In 2013, the ESA began a project called the 3D Printing of Lunar Regolith (3DPL) project. The project is working to build a lunar base using materials found on the moon. The ESA is also working to see if 3D printing can produce materials and structures using moon dust. The ESA's 3D Printing of Lunar Regolith project is being run in conjunction with the European Union's Future and Emerging Technologies arm, known as the FET. A spokesman for ESA said, ""As a practice run, a one-third scale version of a lunar habitat is being created using a 3D printer."" They are also testing 3D printing methods in vacuum chambers to make sure it will work in the moon's airless environment. The ESA is planning to create a 3D printed habitat on the moon. The base will be designed to take advantage of the moon's low gravity and be built from the moon's natural material. It will be a large dome that is 2.6 meters high"

Tsinghua,tldr-340,"Google is close to finalizing a deal to buy or lease a 1.3 million square foot office building in the West Village. The space is large enough to allow Google to set up a second headquarters in New York, a move that could make the search giant the city's largest private employer. The development, which could come as early as this week, will bring Google's total office space in the city to nearly 1 million square feet. It would bring the company's New York office count to 12,000 people, according to a source familiar with the situation. Google would lease the entire 1.3 million square foot building, which would include the office of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his successor, Bill de Blasio. The city's Office of Buildings would have to approve the deal. The company has been working with the city on the development, which has been in the works for several months, according to sources familiar with the deal. The company has had its eye on the 45-story building for years. ""It would be an incredible space,"" said Larry Kim, a partner at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank who is working with the company on the deal. Google's plans are not expected to change, said one source. Google's purchase or lease of the building would likely be the biggest real estate deal in the city since the 2014 sale of the Westfield Times Square mall to Hudson Yards owner Forest City Ratner. The deal would be part of a larger plan to expand its office space in the city. Last year, the company purchased the 110,000 square foot New York Times Building, located in the Financial District, for 400 million. It is now the largest private employer in the city. Google also has leased 200,000 square feet of space in the Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan. The company is expected to build its own office in the neighborhood. Neighbors have long called for Google to build a large headquarters in the neighborhood. The search giant has spent years looking for the perfect building, eventually settling on a 45-story tower, which has 300,000 square feet of space. It has worked with real estate developer JLL to develop the space. It is also working with real estate developers Douglas Elliman to develop a 100,000 square foot office space in the Lower East Side. The company has also purchased 10,000 square feet of office space in the Union Square Building in Greenwich Village.

PaLM,tldr-341,"Most smartphones sold today have large displays and this presents new challenges and opportunities for app makers and designers. The first iPhone was designed for comfortable one-handed operation, but larger displays have made that difficult to achieve. As a result, app makers have had to adapt their designs to work with larger screens, and designers have had to come up with new ways to make their apps look good on big screens. This has led to a number of new trends in mobile app design, including the use of more white space, larger icons, and more interactive elements. App makers have also had to rethink their use of navigation, as the traditional bottom bar is no longer as effective on large screens. As a result, we're seeing more apps use side menus or other navigation methods. The rise of large-screen smartphones has also had a significant impact on the way we use our phones. We're now more likely to use our phones for tasks that require a larger screen, such as watching videos, reading articles, and playing games. This has led to a growth in the number of apps that are designed for these tasks, and it has also changed the way we interact with our phones. As large-screen smartphones continue to grow in popularity, we're likely to see even more changes in mobile app design. Designers will need to find new ways to make their apps look good on big screens, and app makers will need to adapt their apps to work with these new designs."
Tsinghua,tldr-341,"Most smartphones sold today have large displays and this presents new challenges and opportunities for app makers and designers. The first iPhone was designed for comfortable one-handed operation, but larger displays require that designers add functionality in multiple touch points. To design apps that work well with larger displays, we need to design for both the small and the large. Responsive design is the process of designing and developing an app that can adjust to a wide range of screen sizes and orientations. This approach allows you to focus on the functionality and interactions that your users care about, and then scale the UI to different devices. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of responsive design and how to use the techniques and patterns to create apps that look great on any device. How to use the browser's zoom function and zoom features in other apps to adjust the layout to different screen sizes. Using CSS3 media queries to create different UIs for different screen sizes. CSS3 animations to add life to your app's UI. Responsive design and its impact on apps that run on the Web, desktop and mobile devices. What is WebVR? What is it good for? How does it work? What is it good for? WebVR is a new web standard that enables the creation of immersive virtual reality experiences using web technologies. WebVR provides a set of APIs that let you create VR content that runs in a browser. WebVR allows developers to create interactive 3D experiences that can be viewed from any angle and played in a browser on desktop or mobile devices. WebVR uses the existing web platform to provide users with immersive experiences, rather than using a standalone VR device or operating system. This talk will provide an overview of WebVR, including an overview of how WebVR works and what it is good for. I will also cover some of the technical aspects of WebVR, including how it is implemented in browsers, the API design and some common use cases.

This question is particularly important because mobile app development is a moving target. New technologies are coming out on a weekly basis. So, the question is how to keep up with all these changes and be a good architect. I am not going to try to answer this question here. I have a few posts on the topic on my blog, and you can find those posts here. Instead, I would like to present a state of the union on app architectures in mobile apps. There are two main types of mobile app architectures. The first one is platform-based and the second one is app-based. The platform-based architecture is one in which the app is tightly coupled with a particular platform. You use native APIs and frameworks to develop your app. The app architecture depends on the platform it is built for. You might use an app-based architecture if you want to be more independent from the platform. You use web technologies and APIs to build your app. There are many different ways of implementing an app-based architecture. I have a few posts on the topic on my blog, and you can find those posts here. I will try to cover some of the different approaches and their pros and cons. So, what are the main reasons to choose an app-based architecture?"

BigScience,tldr-341,"Most smartphones sold today have large displays and this presents new challenges and opportunities for app makers and designers. The first iPhone was designed for comfortable one-handed operation, but larger phones require two hands to properly use them. In many cases the users do not know how much of a difference there is between an oversized touchscreen phone (such as Samsung Galaxy S4) compared with its smaller brother. The contrast on most smartphone screens is only about 80 - which means that 20 of the light hitting your screen remains undetected by the device's sensor. This makes it difficult for people using low vision devices such as reading glasses or contact lenses to make out what their fingers are touching. If you want to create apps where user interaction needs to be more precise than in recent years then we recommend testing the following features: An oversized display can also take advantage of 3D graphics capabilities, allowing developers to present information visually that may otherwise need text labels. 3D visualization suits content presentation better because traditional 2D representations could lead users astray if they were not able to recognize objects easily. There are quite few applications available for iOS 7 and iPadOS 1 supporting DirectX 12 on iPhone 6s Plus SE 2. For example, Ringside is known to support DX12 on iPhone 8 Max whereas Poker Pro has been tested to work on both iPhones 5SSEMaxiPad 4S Wifi3G4GLTE models. Here we discuss some notable exceptions that does not include games running at native resolution due to GPU limitations like PowerPlay mobile gaming application, NetEase's PC version game Mobile Legends supports DirectX 12 which runs well at 1080p at 60 FPS on all three devices: iPhone XXR88Plus76s65C5, iPad Air 2312 Wi-Fi; however other games run poorly even when graphically set up high. We hope these resources provide useful insights into ways you should consider optimizing any given iOS 11 SDK release for different hardware platforms.

For app makers, this means they need to consider the ergonomics of their design and make sure important buttons and features are accessible with one hand. However, larger phone displays also offer more space for creative designs and innovative features. App makers can take advantage of this by incorporating larger images, videos, and more complex layout options. They can also create split-screen modes that allow users to multitask, such as having a video call while browsing the internet. Overall, the key is to strike a balance between usability and creativity. App makers need to create designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, regardless of screen size."

(UBER) with its Self-Driving Car project, Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB). Until now however, all these companies have tried to separate themselves into niche areas - from driving cars without human intervention to allowing users to engage socially while they drive, instead of causing distractions by being stuck behind the wheel. With Plymouth University working closely together with Vauxhall Motorsport we're proud to announce the first ever UK university event dedicated to Formula One and motorsports technology, taking place at the historic circuit of Brands Hatch in late March 2014. This exciting three day event will include lectures, demonstrations and hands-on sessions exploring topics ranging from design methods and software testing techniques through to how engineers use and improve performance data analysis skills within automotive projects to name just some examples. The backbone of this unique experience will remain one of the world's largest F1 simulators located adjacent to the race track enabling delegates to gain first-hand knowledge of what goes into running an actual race car Visitors can attend comfortably seated either inside the simulator itself which has 13 seats spread across 3 cabins or over here outside where complimentary hot drinks light refreshments await!

This makes it convenient for people who don't have the technical expertise or permissions to install Jupyter on their machines, or for those who need to access Jupyter notebooks on public computers or shared devices. JupyterLite is built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, while still providing enough features to make it useful for basic data science work. It can be run from a URL or downloaded and run locally, making it flexible enough to fit a variety of use cases. One important thing to note is that JupyterLite does not have access to any local files or resources on the machine it is running on, as it runs entirely in the browser. This means that any data or files needed for analysis would need to be uploaded to the JupyterLite environment or accessed through web APIs or remote storage services.

But the most innovative thing Amazon announced was Echo Frames, a pair of sunglasses that can talk to Alexa. The Echo Frames will have built-in speakers and microphones. You can ask Alexa questions and get replies through the speakers. And you can also use the Frames to make calls. There will be a small touchpad on the frame that you can use to control the Frames, and you'll be able to customize the style and size. The Echo Frames will be available in the US by the end of 2019. Astro Robot Astro is a little robot that can clean your house. It's a sort of Roomba with wheels and a screen for eyes. You can ask it questions, but it can't really talk to you. The screen will display the answers to your questions, and it will show you your calendar and the weather. You'll also be able to use it to watch movies, check out photos, and make video calls. Astro will cost 699.99, and it will be available in the US by the end of 2019. Echo Frames and Astro aren't the only products Amazon announced today. It also revealed a new Echo Show that you can tilt. The new Echo Show is smaller and rounder than the old one. It's also only 89.99, which makes it Amazon's cheapest smart screen yet. The new Echo Show is available for pre-order now and will ship starting on October 16. Amazon also unveiled the Echo Dot with Clock. It's just like the Echo Dot, except it has a digital clock on the front. And there's an Echo Dot for your car now. It's basically an Echo Dot that plugs into your cigarette lighter. It also comes with a little mount that attaches to the dashboard. If you're more into smart rings than smart sunglasses, Amazon has something for you. It announced a new Echo Loop that you can wear on your finger. It has two microphones and a small speaker. You can press a button on the ring to summon Alexa, and you can use it to make phone calls, send messages, and listen to music. It's available for pre-order starting today. Amazon also unveiled a new Echo Glow that kids can use to make music. It's basically a smart version of the light-up balls kids play with. Last but not least, Amazon revealed a new Echo Flex. It's a tiny smart speaker that you can plug into a wall socket, which makes it the most versatile Echo yet. It has a built-in night light, and you can ask it to do the same things you can ask the other Echo devices to do. The Echo Flex is 24.99 and is available for pre-order today.

It's part of your title in life: ""business owner"" or ""professional partner."" Yet we still struggle with it - even though we know what it's meant to mean. We've got some words for you: As one of our partners put it: ""I see entrepreneurship as being about creating something from nothing. I'm not sure I'd ever call [that] business ownership...I'd say my company is owned by me. If I sold the idea itself then maybe that's ownership but if I own all aspects at every level then really there's zero focus on anything other than having money earned for myself through working hard ... You're essentially running a solo show here trying to find ways to make yourself happy doing work you're passionate about. That doesn't address the problems created when people run their businesses like they are running a show rather than focusing on growing their actual biz. Without passion and purpose behind what you do, you're going nowhere fast. And unless you give up your power over others to serve them well endlessly, you're basically never enjoying your stuff very much. It takes a lot of energy to keep pushing forward without knowing whether any goal will actually come true or fail miserably along the way...The pressure always seems unbearable because success wasn't promised on investment day but failure didn't seem possible either. But most importantly, both didn't happen! So now you're running in circles wondering where things could get better before taking another look into getting out again and hoping everything turns around. The only thing guaranteed in 'entrepreneurial' terms is change ... Change is scary so we avoid it like crazy. All the best intentions lead us back to square one."""
BigScience,tldr-348,"This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of ""Multi-Level Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution 3D Human Digitization."" The code can create high-resolution 3D models of humans from a single image. A similar approach was used in [1]. However, the model is trained on images with two cameras attached to each foot. This improves accuracy over methods that use only one camera. The Python versions I have been using are 3.6 and 4.7.4 (on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS). All libraries installed include numpy 1.18.0, scipy 0.14.1, tensorflow-gpu 2.2.3, keras 2.5.5, pytorch 7.1.0, matplotlib 1.2.1, pandas 0.13.2, scikit-image 0.17.0, PIL (Python Image Library) 8. Training In order to train this network we need an appropriate set-up. Our training data consists of human body samples which were obtained by scanning them at high resolution (approx. 300x300 px per pixel). We also obtain realistic environment images (without any objects or people), which are required as input during testing due to their inaccurate camera calibration parameters. In our case they are taken from real environments where there are no people present. They can be either natural scenes such as grasslands, forests etc., urban areas like skyscrapers, buildings or even indoor rooms filled with office furniture. Since our goal is creating precise digitized models, not just low quality approximations, neither precise object pose estimation nor accurate face detection is necessary; hence we do not apply these techniques but rather perform manual labeling manually or through automatic segmentation algorithms [28, 19]. Network Architecture As shown in Figure 6, the main components of the proposed architecture are: Preprocessing module During pre processing several operations are applied: sub-sampling, cropping, background estimation and foreground extraction [6]. Sub sampling -It transforms original image into smaller ones preserving its shape while decreasing its dimensions. For example, if input image has size 500 800 pixels then it will first resize down to 100 150 ... 200 400 pixels depending on maximum allowed heightwidth ratio. Then again it'll drop next layer above in proportion till reaching desired dimensions. Cropping: To achieve better scan matching later on we'll crop out some parts of the image containing little information about the scanned object. We choose rectangle-shaped regions in different scales and locations around the black silhouette extracted earlier. Background estimation: The purpose here is to get rid of unwanted elements inside the scene causing false detections e.g. shadows created by nearby surfaces and bright spots caused by sunlight reflected on windows. It does so by estimating color distribution within region-of-interest and modeling it using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Foreground extractor: As illustrated in figure 5 (a), after performing background removal operation by GMM and applying thresholds it's possible to locate the whole human body area visually. But during actual registration process we can't rely entirely on visual inspection since it results in a very rough estimate of the position of both feet thus making the system less precise. Therefore we try to improve those estimates via machine learning approaches. Intuitively background removed object should appear brighter than surrounding areas. Hence one could expect classification error rates regarding certain partssilhouettes to decrease remarkably when providing more image examples from same class with given features. In other words, multiple instances of foreground samples provide additional context allowing us to obtain more reliable object location estimates compared to single instance scenario. Data Augmentation is particularly important in deep neural networks because simple data augmentation helps prevent overfitting. Since 2D images don't contain enough spatial information to give good predictions, sometimes adding random jitter to all coordinates causes large improvements [26]. Pixels' values are randomly scaled between -0.05 and 0.05. Rotating the entire image: x y z rand 1,..., 1) (this performs random rotation without changing scale factor) Rotating individual views: x y z abs (rand 1,..., 1 (this simulates pure translation along x-axis and second time orthogonal transformation of coordinate system) Image Resizing Predictions After training datasets become available we run inference phase to generate test outputs. During prediction Core-VGG-16 [16] model generates bounding boxes corresponding to detected faces starting from lower left corner upto upper right corner. Labeled points are placed near centers of those boxes. On top of detected persons, foreground blobs are computed based upon RGB channel output and added back to generated point cloud figures in order to make final complete scan representations. Estimated positions of the head and hands represent center of gravity points of respective armshands. These are labeled accurately at least in terms of relative distances among various joints. Inference procedure allows obtaining dense output clouds with highly detailed geometries. Even though most of the segments come close to ground truth labels, errors still occur due to occlusions and missing limbs. An advantage of having deep convolutional networks instead of simpler regression-based solutions relies on ability to: predict exact poses directly and take full advantage of intermediate layers capabilities, unlike hand-crafted appearance descriptors. While predicting skeleton's bones, fusing complementary depth channels makes it much easier to deal with partial perspectives"

In order to achieve this goal, the island nation plans to build more farms, especially on waste land. However, the island nation is facing a dilemma. It has to provide its people with a balanced diet, but it cannot continue to rely on imports for this. Thus, the solution is to use waste to produce more food. One of the major components of waste is rice. While Singapore has one of the highest rates of rice consumption in the world, its rice supply is not sufficient to meet demand. The country imports more than 90 percent of its rice, and is likely to be dependent on imports for the next 30 years. The island nation is now looking to create a new source of food from rice waste. By transforming rice waste into biofuel, Singapore hopes to become self-sufficient in rice production by 2025. The Circular Rice Initiative In order to achieve this goal, Singapore is taking a two-pronged approach. First, it is exploring the feasibility of a closed-loop system that produces energy from rice waste. It is using the city-state's own rice waste to fuel electric cars. The initiative is called the Circular Rice Initiative. Second, the government is planning to build a large-scale rice production facility that will utilize waste. The facility is expected to generate enough rice for 1.5 million people. In addition to rice, it will produce other crops, such as sugarcane, and possibly palm oil. The facility is expected to be completed by 2022. While the initiative will be a major investment for the government, it is expected to save Singapore 1.5 billion in food costs. The government has stated that it hopes to reduce its food imports by 50 percent by 2030. Investing in the Future of Food A successful venture in the circular rice initiative will be a major step toward Singapore's goal of becoming self-sufficient in rice production. This will not only reduce the island nation's reliance on imports, but also contribute to the overall goal of reducing its food imports by 50 percent by 2030.

Configurations can easily be modified, upgraded or removed without restarting containers. At this time there has not been much interest in installing Docker on Linux so we don't have an official way for it yet but I would highly recommend trying out one of these methods as they are almost foolproof. The work around at this point is to use VMWare Fusion Pro 12.0 with Docker support (I am unsure what version that will be available when writing this post). The problem here is that you can't run multiple virtual machines concurrently due to some hardware limitation. In order get around this limitation you need either 2 CPU's or create your own physical machine which runs both systems simultaneously.

Discussion is discouraged on Wikipedia. Jeff doesn't like people using Stack Overflow to debate each other. He thinks that the focus of the site should be on providing answers, not discussion. There's a separate site, Stack Exchange, for discussion. Jeff says, ""If you are more interested in debating programming trivia than finding quality answers to your programming questions, you are in the wrong place."" I think Jeff is right. The problem with the wiki model is that it's only good if everyone is trying to work together. If someone is trying to make the site worse or spread misinformation, then the wiki model falls apart. If you edit an article on Wikipedia to spread misinformation, other editors will revert your changes. If you keep doing it, you'll eventually be banned. On Stack Overflow, there is no mechanism for enforcing good edits. If you post an answer that is wrong, people will downvote it. If you post a good answer, people will upvote it.

The problem with wikis are they don't lend themselves easily to discussions because you have to keep your answers up-to-date and current regularly if it's going to actually become useful knowledge. For example, on Wikipedia there's been quite a bit happening lately. Is anyone really interested in keeping track of all those conversations?

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but I'm new to this site and I really don't understand what this article is saying. Is there a mistake in this article? If not, then what is it that I'm missing?

LLAMA,tldr-357,"React Arborist is a fully-featured tree component for React. It provides all the common features expected in a tree, for example, it can open and close folders, efficiently show thousands of items, and so on. The tree is implemented using Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI when the data changes. The tree also automatically renders the items in a tree structure, and you can easily customize it to display any kind of data. An important feature of the tree is its memory optimization. The tree uses a Virtual DOM representation of the tree to efficiently update the UI. It also uses an efficient algorithm to render the tree, minimizing memory usage by reusing the same instance of an item when it appears multiple times in the tree. A tree is defined by an array of items. Items can have children. If an item has children, it is a folder. If an item doesn't have children, it is a leaf. You define the type of an item with a config object. It specifies the data, children and other features for an item. The React Arborist library is a standalone component, and it doesn't depend on other libraries. You can download it from npm or import it directly from unpkg.com. The tree is a React component that is built on top of a Virtual DOM representation of the tree. When the tree data changes, React automatically updates the Virtual DOM tree and only the changes are reflected in the DOM tree. This provides a significant performance boost when rendering thousands of items. The tree supports keyboard navigation, which enables the user to navigate the tree using the keyboard only. The tree supports drag and drop which enables users to reorder the tree, move items between folders, and so on. The tree provides a Context API which enables you to open and close folders and items, and access the data, selection and other items in the tree. The tree is highly configurable and you can customize it to display any kind of data. It provides an extensive API to customize the look and feel of the tree. There are many ways to get started with React Arborist. The most straightforward way is to use it with create-react-app. Another way is to use create-react-app, create a new React app and install the react-arborist package with npm. The React Arborist tree provides a rich API to customize its look and feel. The following sections describe the various ways you can customize the tree. The tree provides a set of pre-defined styles that you can use to customize the look and feel of the tree. It uses the react-app-rewired library to customize the look and feel of the tree. For more information, see Using the React Arborist App Rewiring Library. You can use the App Rewiring library to customize the look and feel of the tree. It also enables you to use your own CSS and JS files, and override the existing components. The app rewiring library enables you to override components and styles. You can also import your own CSS and JS files. For more information, see Using the React Arborist App Rewiring Library. The tree provides various APIs that enable you to control the behavior of the tree. For example, you can control the node expansion, selection, and so on. The tree provides a Context API that enables you to access the tree data, selection, and other information. You can use the API to control the behavior of the tree. The following sections describe how to use the Context API. To access the Context API, you need to wrap your tree with the withContext function. This enables you to access the API from your tree. The Context API enables you to get and set data, selection and other information from your tree. For example, to get the currently selected item, use the getSelectedItem method. The Context API enables you to open, close and toggle the expansion state of the tree and its items. For example, to open an item, use the openItem method. The Context API enables you to select an item in the tree. For example, to select the item with the id ""1,"" use the selectItem method. The Context API enables you to access the tree data. For example, to get an item by its id, use the getItem method. The Context API enables you to access the data for the currently selected item. For example, to get the name of the currently selected item, use the getSelectedItemName method. The Context API enables you to get the currently selected items in the tree. For example, to get the currently selected items, use the getSelectedItems method. The tree supports keyboard navigation. You can use the keyboard to navigate the tree.

LLAMA,tldr-358,"The ACLU polled the 20 biggest brick and mortar retailers in the US last year and only one said they did not routinely photograph customers. Walmart admitted to testing facial recognition technology but has no plans to implement it. Amazon, meanwhile, has been selling its facial recognition technology to police departments and is working on using it to track people as they go about their daily lives. The 45-minute film will be released in October. Facebook has confirmed that it has stopped allowing advertisers to target housing, employment, and credit ads based on people's ethnicity, gender, and age. It's a reversal of the company's earlier decision to remove the ad targeting option following a lawsuit by the National Fair Housing Alliance. Facebook says that it can now prevent advertisers from discriminating against people by using its multicultural affinity segmentation, which groups people based on their interests, not their ethnicity, gender, or age. ""We want to be a responsible digital platform that not only protects civil rights but also serves as a key force for social progress,"" Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in a blog post. Facebook is also creating a new tool to let people see all the current ads a Facebook page is running, even if they're not in the intended audience. A new study has found that the ""right to be forgotten"" laws that allow people to request that Google remove links to their personal information are not working as intended. The study, which was published by the University of Michigan's School of Information, analyzed 2.4 million URLs that people tried to get removed from Google searches of their names between 2014 and 2017. The study found that of the 291,000 requests that Google granted, only 43.3 of them were for personal information, and that 22.2 of the granted requests were for pages containing negative information about the requester. The researchers found that Google approved about 54 of the requests they received, while the other 46 were rejected. More than 3 million people have viewed the video, which shows a fake video chat with a purported Apple tech support rep. The scammers attempt to get the victim to download remote desktop software that lets them access the victim's computer. The video is a recreation of a real scam that YouTube star and tech reporter Dave Lee experienced when he was contacted by the scammers and agreed to record a video of the interaction. The scammers tried to trick Lee by saying that they were calling from Apple and could tell that he was having issues with his computer. The scammers told Lee that he needed to download software that would help them fix his computer, but he refused. Lee posted a video of the conversation to YouTube and the video has been viewed more than 1.8 million times. Four months after the story broke, Facebook has finally responded to the outcry over its Messenger Kids app that allows children as young as 6 to have their own social media account. Facebook says it's working on new tools that will give parents better control over who their children can interact with on the app, but it did not give a date for when the tools will be available. The tools will allow parents to specify that their child can only send and receive messages from parent-approved contacts. Parents can also remove a child's account at any time. Facebook has come under fire for not having adequate safeguards to prevent children from being bullied or harassed on the app. The app is aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 12, and the company says that it has designed it to be compliant with federal laws that limit the collection and use of data on children. A US senator is asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Snapchat is violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which limits the data that can be collected on children younger than 13. Snapchat says that its app is not intended for children younger than 13 and that it relies on parents to make sure that children aren't using its app. Snapchat says that it has no interest in collecting data on children and that it automatically deletes the data it collects on children every 30 days. YouTube has announced that it is planning to launch a new app for kids on Feb. 23 that will feature child-appropriate videos and channels. YouTube says that the app will be free and will be ad-free"

These technologies can be used to track customers' movements in stores, collect data on their purchases, and target them with advertising.

Bitcoin is already decentralized by design - which means it's open source software that's anyone can download, run on their computers, modify without permission and reuse freely if they wish to do so. The whole concept behind Bitcoin was originally inspired by ""The Matrix"" movie series (for those who don't know). As explained there, our online identity isn't really defined by anything outside ourselves, but instead we are always being controlled by someone else somewhere. This is why one day you may wake up with no memory of your own existence, just because you're programmed into thinking otherwise. In this respect, Bitcoin sounds like the ultimate solution to this problem; it will allow us all to literally be whoever we want. Additionally, money itself wasn't created until quite recently (around 1694), when economist Adam Smith played around with ideas about how people could trade goods and services. At first he concentrated mostly on creating something similar to gold coins, known later on as silver dollars. However, he quickly realized that currency alone couldn't solve any problems, considering that most countries were still running on feudal systems where property rights didn't exist at all. It became obvious right away that only paper money would work, meaning bank notes printed automatically upon demand. Because nobody has control over its creation process, using fiat money requires trust between individuals, guaranteeing everyone's access to cash - even though nobody actually keeps their assets safe under lock and key. Nowadays, crypto currencies have become quite popular, especially after governments started regulating crypto markets more strictly due to their growing popularity among ordinary citizens throughout the world. Some of these regulations include taxation, laws against illegal activities and other issues related to financial safety."

Chinese scientists have found that the gene-editing He Jiankui performed on twins Lulu and Nana last year had unintended consequences.

But it's unclear whether the missing genes will affect the twins' health. Missing genes in the Chinese twins Lulu and Nana's father is HIV-positive, so the scientists intended to remove the CCR5 gene in the embryos to make the girls immune to the AIDS virus.

But He's team now says that the twins are healthy. The girls' immune systems are still functioning, but it's unclear whether the deleted genes are affecting other areas of the twins' bodies. But the results of the report were ""highly inappropriate,"" said He Jiankui. He said that he would monitor the twins' health over the next 18 years.

It is important to note that the gene-editing was performed on embryos, which were then implanted into women's wombs. This means that the twins were born with the edited genes. It is not yet known whether the gene-editing will have any long-term effects on their health. The Chinese government has condemned He Jiankui's actions and has called for a full investigation. The World Health Organization has also expressed concern about the gene-editing, and has called for a moratorium on all clinical trials of gene-editing in humans."

The new service hasn't been announced yet but it seems like it's going to come soon - with support starting at least in Australia. Snapchat's main rival on this list - Instagram - launched its own payments system earlier this year called ""Instagram Shopping"" after seeing how other social media platforms were taking advantage of mobile shopping. Now that Facebook wants payday as well (or maybe even sooner), all eyes are spotlighted onto why they've chosen Shopify rather than their native app. The latest addition to Snapchat was only possible because Shopify made use of their image-based payment processing services. Alongside the ability to easily upload images into your shop with no coding required, you can also try out several different formats for making purchases from; namely: In the future, we could see more integration between both apps since both companies seem interested in pushing further towards online commerce. Shopify offers some incredible features such as: customizable ecommerce themes, drag-and-drop functionality to create an e-commerce storefront without any coding experience needed, email marketing tools, security settings, inventory management, shipping estimates, coupon codes discounts, faster website loading speeds, etc... It doesn't stop there though! Aside from: shipping rates, product categories, ordering processes, sales notifications, and many more! It also comes backed by top brand partners including Nike, Adidas, ASOS, Clarks Shoes, Samsung, Levi's Jeans, New Balance, Burberry, Dior, and almost every major fashion designer you might encounter anywhere around the world today! With so much variety when choosing what theme or template to install, it takes away one huge problem which all businesses have to deal with: design costs. No matter if you're just beginning to build up your business or want something completely unique featuring branding elements from your company logo, Shopify makes sure you get exactly what you need! Plus, all of them are free to download instantly, ensuring no extra fees attached once purchased. While both apps offer similar functions, each platform focuses on specific user groups within the industry. This means that if you're looking for feature-rich solutions for building a sophisticated customer relationship strategy using smart automation capabilities, then Shopify may not be the best option due to limitations regarding integrations and out-of-the-box options available. For example, most cloud-platform ERP systems include advanced analytics and CRM capability. However, these aren't always built into either Shopify or BigCommerce applications themselves. Instead, software vendors often partner with third-party developers who specialize in certain programming languages and technologies to enhance built-in functionalities. For example: However, Shopify relies solely upon built-ins whereas Big Commerce allows users to choose another vendor above among 36 providers. So, whether you decide to go with Shopify vs Big Commerce depends primarily on: what size boutique you're planning to run along with where you're based globally. By selecting one of these platforms instead of creating your own solution specifically catering to your needs, you'll find yourself saving money, time, resources, and energy whilst giving customers everything they're searching for: ease-of-use, simplicity, speed, high-end graphics quality, multichannel selling capabilities, secure transactions, seamless data synchronization, and highly optimized performance. Having said that, none of these two platforms do anything wrong per se. In fact, the good thing about having multiple choices is: you never know until you explore!

Tsinghua,tldr-366,"GPS systems are unable to work underwater as water breaks down the radio waves GPS relies on to function. MIT scientists have developed a device called an underwater backscatter localization system (UBLS) which uses sound to accurately locate underwater objects. Using a sonar device, an underwater UBLS device can be sent into the water and determine the location of a fish, or other object, that is in contact with the device. The UBLS system uses sound waves to transmit data to the fish or other object, and the sound waves bounce off the object and back to the device, providing the location of the object. The UBLS device can be fitted with a GPS to provide accurate location information. By using sound waves to send data to the fish or other object, the UBLS system does not require power, as radio waves used by GPS systems require power to work. MIT's UBLS device can be used to send data to a fish and determine the location of a fish in the water.

The system is comprised of a transmitter and receiver that send and receive acoustic signals to and from a transponder. The transponder is attached to the object to be located and transmits a unique acoustic signal. The receiver detects the signal and uses it to determine the distance and direction to the transponder. The transmitter then transmits a second signal, which is received by the transponder and reflected back to the receiver. The receiver uses the reflected signal to calculate the object's position. The system is accurate to within a few meters and can be used in both fresh and saltwater."
BigScience,tldr-366,"GPS systems are unable to work underwater as water breaks down the radio waves GPS relies on to function. MIT scientists have developed a device called an underwater backscatter localization system which works in seawater and is capable of working upside-down, too. The prototype uses sensors mounted onto a vehicle that can move parallel to or perpendicularly with respect to water current. The researchers say this gives them better control over how fast their sensor runs through water compared to other methods such as using robots that float passively by. Their method could also help optimize marine location services like LoRaWAN (LOReal WAN) technology used for communications between submarines, boats, ships, and land-based stations. This technology helps save time during search-and-rescue missions because it removes errors caused when signals bounce off ocean surfaces. Television In television broadcasting, analog terrestrial TV broadcasts use carrier frequencies ranging from 470MHz - 960MHz. Digital-only television signal carriers may range anywhere from 1GHz to 27GHz, depending upon the transmission band used; some countries allow broadcasting higher than 27 GHz but most do not. Studies showed that at nighttime in cities where there isn't significant interference from mobile phone towers or radar radars, there was no difference in reception quality between 433 MHz and 928 MHz channels, although in areas closer to radars and tower transmitters these results varied significantly. Some studies show that recepcao depends more on antenna height rather than frequency. It has been shown that one meter of stationery metal walls typically only reduces reception by 20, while four meters will reduce reception levels by 50, even if they were removed all together and replaced by large windows with clear sides. Radio Communications via Radio Frequency Interference occur when two radios operating within close proximity interfere with each other's transmissions due to cross-talk. When left unprotected, RFID readers may be easily interfered with by nearby RFID tags. In contrast to electromagnetic radiation near microwaves bands in the VHFHFUHF spectrum, high-frequency low-power millimeter-wave emissions exhibit relatively small absorption losses at typical distances, making the subject of intense research interest. Just as with AMFM applications, the appropriate shielding distance varies considerably based on emission power density, receiver sensitivity, transmitter type, target reflectivity, and many other factors. For example, tag-to-reader interference increases sharply below 7-100 mWm, whereas reader-to-receiver interference generally rises much slower beyond 100 mWm. One study found that interference occurs whenever the total reflected power exceeds 5 dBm at 45 incidence angle and 40-60 mm separation; however, about half the emitted power must exceed 3 dBm for severe interferences above 70 incident angles and 150 mm separation. An antenna design often involves minimizing near-field coupling to surrounding structures so that signal strength falls below worst-case interference thresholds. Microwave It depends mostly on directionality of antennas at source and receiver, whether you need limiting of its effects, or just trying to avoid it entirely There is another theory regarding microwave interference: ""If your radio's operator is talking loud enough to reach outside his house into your basement, then he probably needs legal permission to operate his radio there! Because his radio might affect yours in ways you don't know yet."""

Spotify is frustrated with Apple's 30 percent take of subscription revenue and the restrictions that the App Store puts on third-party apps. Announced in an official Spotify blog post, the music streaming service explains how Apple has given itself ""an unfair advantage at every turn."" Apple requires that Spotify and other digital services pay a 30 tax on purchases made through Apple's payment system, including upgrading from our Free to our Premium service. If we pay this tax, it would force us to artificially inflate the price of our Premium membership well above the price of Apple Music. And to keep our price competitive for our customers, that isn't something we can do. As an alternative, if we choose not to use Apple's payment system, forgoing the charge, Apple then applies a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions on Spotify. For example, they limit our communication with our customers - including our outreach beyond the app. In some cases, we aren't even allowed to send emails to our customers who use Apple. Apple also routinely blocks our experience-enhancing upgrades. Over time, this has included locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as Siri, HomePod, and Apple Watch. Spotify also says Apple has blocked Spotify from accessing Siri and HomePod, which is a big deal because Spotify has created Siri commands and AirPlay 2 support that Apple is refusing to implement. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek in a Twitter thread explained that the goal of the complaint is not to ""harm Apple,"" but to address Apple's anti-competitive behavior and allow ""all companies to compete fairly and consumers to win."" In recent years, Apple has introduced rules to the App Store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience - essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers. After trying unsuccessfully to resolve the issues directly with Apple, we're now requesting that the EC take action to ensure fair competition. Ek says Apple has blocked Spotify's efforts to upgrade its app for years, has ""routinely"" blocked its experience-enhancing upgrades, and has ""applied a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions on Spotify."" Apple has responded to Spotify's allegations, calling it ""misleading rhetoric"" and accusing the music streaming company of wanting all of the benefits of the App Store without contributing to the costs of running it. Ek took to Twitter to respond, saying that Apple's statement is ""cute"" but doesn't address the core issues. The Spotify complaint comes after Apple Music overtook Spotify in paid U.S. subscribers in July 2018, and the service is said to be continuing to grow rapidly.

Amazon's device has been able to sense habits and ask about them since 2018, but the biggest change with this version is that customers can ask Alexa for specific advice or information. This includes practical, helpful tips such as ""How do I buy a new car?"" or even more personal questions like ""How would you describe your best friend in three words"" - all of which can get answered by AI without any user input. The feature was originally announced at CES back in January 2019 but did not go live until last September after major upgrades were made to how it works. What's also very interesting here is Google Assistant got similar functionality out earlier than Alexa before too. In fact, nest smart home devices use much of what we've seen from Alexa already including Nest Hub Max, Echo Show 5 (Amazon) 10 (Google), Fire TV Stick 4K 3rd Gen (Amazon), Pixel 4 XL (Google). There are a few limitations though when using these tech solutions. For example, there aren't many things an Alexa app can't help you with yet unless you're asking something related to purchases or financial services. Other people have reported issues ordering products online through their voice assistant. Experts say that if both companies could come together soon then they'd be able to offer a lot more features. As well as getting better experiences overall, it's clear that consumers are starting to clamour for simple answers rather than having to search the web themselves. Farmers have observed that online sales platforms often charge high prices for seeds while providing low quality products unlike local stores where farmers pay retail rates According to global market research firm Euromonitor International, India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets worldwide during 2020 owing to Covid-19 outbreak. (Picture: Pixabay) Till recently seed farming had always remained dormant within farmers' investment priorities due to lack of reliable availability and affordable price tags. However, following COVID-19 pandemic impacting large sections of Indian society, increasing digitalization amongst rural households and rapid adoption of smartphones among farmers, interest in buying agricultural produce via online shopping portals has grown significantly. Globally, several countries claim exclusive rights over certain crops which means growers cannot purchase seeds outside those jurisdictions causing delays in planting seasons across different regions. While some areas have started issuing permissions allowing sellers of other brands to grow specific crop varieties under broader licenses granted by governments, others still remain non-transparent regarding licensing agreements between cropping firms and state-owned organisations. In these situations, farmers who want to invest extra money into growing fresh produce may opt to source agricultural commodities elsewhere resulting in increased food supply costs borne only by consumers thereby putting pressure on government budgets."

The update will bring greater transaction privacy through Schorr signatures, which will make simple transactions indistinguishable from multi-signature transactions. Taproot allows Bitcoin to offer private transactions by making use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature type. While it is important to remember that no one is really talking about a ""private"" Bitcoin, but rather, an ""indistinguishable"" Bitcoin, there is no reason to expect that there will be a significant drop in Bitcoin transactions. Why is this? After all, Bitcoin is not currently usable without the ability to make multi-signature transactions, and with the use of a signature type like Schorr, it becomes even easier. So why aren't we seeing a huge drop in Bitcoin transactions? As we discussed in a previous article, the only reason for a drop in Bitcoin transactions would be a massive decrease in demand for Bitcoin. That simply isn't the case, and it isn't even remotely close to being the case. If the adoption of Bitcoin had dropped off dramatically, it would be easy to see. The reason why we haven't seen a massive decrease in demand for Bitcoin is because there are several different use cases for Bitcoin that have not been sufficiently tapped into yet. There is a large user base of people who have Bitcoin because they want to use it as a currency for things like sending money to family overseas. They are the first to turn off when they see that there is no growth. There is also a large user base of people who are trying to use Bitcoin to purchase things online. There is a large user base of people who want to use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services. There is a large user base of people who want to use Bitcoin to invest. Bitcoin is the only digital currency that has the ability to support all of these use cases, and if Bitcoin were to suddenly lose any of these use cases, it would certainly cause a drop in demand for Bitcoin. The recent switchover to Taproot is an example of the Taproot protocol that was being tested before the switchover. This test of the Taproot protocol will allow Bitcoin to implement some of the privacy features that it will have in the future. Taproot also allows Bitcoin to become more scalable, and it does this by reducing the amount of gas that needs to be spent on every transaction. Taproot will not only make Bitcoin more private, but it will also make Bitcoin more scalable, which is a good thing. So why aren't we seeing a massive drop in Bitcoin transactions? Because there are several use cases for Bitcoin that have not been sufficiently tapped into yet.

The images show a surface littered with craters, with some reaching several hundred miles in diameter. The images also show terrain that is covered in smooth plains. These areas are the result of volcanic activity in the planet's past. The plains are also streaked with ridges and cracks, which were likely the result of the planet's cooling and shrinking. The spacecraft also spotted smaller craters with bright halos around them. Scientists believe that these areas are covered in ejecta from other craters. The images show the planet's surface in much greater detail than what we've seen previously. Scientists hope that the images and data will help them better understand the planet's geology and formation. BepiColombo will remain in its current orbit around the Sun until late 2020.

Ripple has long argued that banks should soon be able to use alternative currencies like bitcoin as payment methods for international remittances. The announcement came just days after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against Ripple and six other people alleging they conspired in an illegal scheme to defraud investors by under-reporting their profits. On Tuesday, SEC Director Daniel Paulsen told CNBC he was not concerned about crippling regulations on crypto companies such as Facebook or Twitter which could jeopardize innovation. In his first interview since being appointed new director at the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, Mr. Paulsen said if regulators create too many rules it would stifle innovation from emerging technologies firms. He also asserted there is no need for aggressive enforcement of laws designed around securities fraud, saying that ""it doesn't serve the public interest"" and ""funds some criminality. It funds some organized crime activity because it's so easy...to circumvent those kind of anti-money laundering requirements."" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently called Bitcoin ""too hardcore"" based on its five distinct features: privacy, decentralization, immutability, universality, and fungibility. While acknowledging these are important qualities, he added that Bitcoin's benefits don't extend far beyond payments when used outside of traditional financial transactions. This can lead individuals who aren't involved in traditional finance to have a false sense of security regarding cryptocurrencies, including XRP - something that might explain why consumers seem reluctant to adopt them more broadly into everyday life. ""I can't tell you how often I've seen this conversation happen where somebody says 'Oh my gosh, I got bitcoins four years ago but now I'm probably safe'...I think most people reading this still feel pretty secure right?

Tsinghua,tldr-377,"Scientists from the University of Oxford and robotics firm Devanthro grew cells on a robot skeleton in an experiment designed to create more flexible lab-grown cells. The researchers used the robot as a scaffolding for growing skin cells on top of, and next to, the body of the robot. In a paper published in the journal Nature, the researchers described how they used a small chip, which contained a 3D printer, to grow the cells. The robot, which is known as a ""multi-arm manipulator,"" is a humanoid robot that can be programmed to carry out a number of tasks. The robot is made up of a number of joints, each of which is controlled by a servo motor. The robot's joints can move 100 degrees in all directions. The robot is able to move around a workspace, and the researchers used this to create a 3D cell-culture platform. ""It's the first time anyone has ever grown cells on a robot,"" said Inderjit Dhillon, a mechanical engineer at the University of Oxford and the lead author of the study. ""We hope that our platform will allow scientists to develop new types of tissue for use in drug discovery, drug delivery, regenerative medicine and other applications."" The researchers began by printing a scaffold on the robot, which is made up of 25 separate layers. The cells are then placed on top of this scaffold and grown for 14 days. After this time, the researchers took the cells off the robot and placed them in a petri dish. They then analyzed the cells, and discovered that the cells were flexible, and able to move around the robot's joints. ""We're really excited about this platform,"" said co-author, Devanthro CEO, Dilip Misra. ""This is the first time we've ever printed and cultured cells on a robot. We're looking forward to collaborating with researchers and the medical industry to explore how this platform can be used in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and drug discovery."" The researchers also tested how the robot would respond to various drugs, including the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. The robot was able to withstand the harsh chemicals and continued to function. ""The main challenge with growing cells in the lab is that they tend to stick to the surfaces they're grown on,"" said co-author of the study, Alastair Johnson, a mechanical engineer at the University of Oxford. ""We wanted to develop a platform that would allow cells to grow on a variety of different surfaces."" The researchers are now working to improve the robot, and to make it a fully functioning device. They hope to use the robot to develop drug-delivery systems, and to allow for the controlled delivery of drugs to specific areas of the body.

LLAMA,tldr-377,"Scientists from the University of Oxford and robotics firm Devanthro grew cells on a robot skeleton in an experiment designed to create more flexible lab-grown cells. The researchers used the soft-robot skeleton as a platform on which to grow skeletal muscle tissue. After it grew, they disconnected the robot from its power source and then electrically stimulated it to see if it would move. The experiment wasn't about building the bionic man, though. It was about the fact that lab-grown tissue is stiff and difficult to grow around anything other than rigid plastic scaffolds. The stiffness of these scaffolds can actually lead to the lab-grown tissue being less functional. The researchers used a robot skeleton in order to create a more natural environment for the muscle tissue to grow around. They were able to remove the rigid scaffold and grow the cells directly on the robot. The hope is that the more natural environment will lead to cells that are more functional and less stiff. The team used a custom-made bioreactor to grow the cells on the robot's skeleton. The robot skeleton was made of artificial tendons and silicone air sacs, or actuators, that were designed to be similar to the ones in the human hand. The robot skeleton was also able to replicate the way the human hand moves when grabbing something. The team used neonatal rat muscle cells to grow the tissue. They attached the cells to the robot skeleton, which was then placed in the bioreactor. They used electricity to stimulate the cells in the same way they would be stimulated in a living body. The cells grew and developed into functioning muscle tissue around the robot skeleton. The researchers then removed the robot skeleton from the bioreactor and connected it to a portable battery. They were able to make the muscles contract by sending an electrical current through the robot skeleton. This experiment demonstrates that it's possible to use the robot skeleton as a scaffold and that the muscle tissue will still function after it's removed from the bioreactor. The team hopes to continue their research using human cells instead of rat cells in order to test how the muscle tissue could be used in the human body. This is just the beginning of the research, but it's an important step towards the use of lab-grown muscle tissue in the human body. The University of Oxford and Devanthro presented their research at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation."

While Facebook has rules regarding the type of content that is allowed, it is impossible for the company to review every single piece of content that is posted. This has led to a number of issues, including the spread of misinformation and hate speech. In an effort to address these issues, Facebook has been working to improve its content moderation system. However, this has proven to be a difficult task, and there is no guarantee that the system will be able to completely eliminate the spread of harmful content."
BigScience,tldr-379,"As one of the largest social networks, Facebook receives a massive amount of content from users all over the world.

It is for this reason that using our tools will help you keep up with your followers and build a rapport with them in an effort to make their lives easier when they need a dentist in Realm City AZ! When posting picturesvideos online, there are some things people want to know about the dentist they're looking at before making a decision to visit: In fact, even if someone doesn't mention anything negative in public (obviously!), there may still exist unseen issues buried beneath those photos - which could potentially affect how comfortable other patients feel being treated by himher. Fortunately, we've developed technology called Dental Practice Reviews,which helps us identify potential problems online based off private feedback left within each patient profile. Dental Practice Reviews uses real client testimonials posted into a database through third-party referral sources such as Google My Business, Yelp, Microsoft Outlook, etc., so that a user can compare between different reviews submitted by various clients and find out exactly where hisher concerns lie. With every new review added, we update our search algorithm to ensure that most recent opinions reflect current overall satisfaction rates. This means that no matter what brand name you're using, only newer ratings impact results like ""Best Dentists"" searches more than 6 months old; older ones won't feature anywhere near these lists. To put things simply... when you post positive feedback about another dental office on Dental Practice Reviews, the entire community gains access to it. By doing this, it's possible to install word-of-mouth marketing campaigns across thousands of individual profiles without ever having to spend money advertising offline."
Tsinghua,tldr-379,"As one of the largest social networks, Facebook receives a massive amount of content from users all over the world. While Facebook has rules regarding the type of content that is acceptable, they don't police the content that they do not want. In fact, they often actively encourage their users to violate their rules. Because of this, Facebook is constantly under fire for their lack of control over content. For example, a couple of weeks ago, Facebook was accused of not taking down a post by one of their users who called for violence against their children. The post went viral and even received a statement from the White House. In fact, the White House released a statement that said, ""We are deeply troubled by this content and by reports that Facebook did not remove it quickly enough."" The White House also stated that it was ""deeply troubled"" that Facebook didn't take the post down sooner. This is a prime example of why Facebook needs to have a clear and easy-to-understand policy regarding what content is acceptable and what content is not acceptable. Failing to have such a policy will only make it easier for their users to post content that they do not want their friends to see. And that's just the type of content that they are most concerned about. What about the other types of content that Facebook receives? Well, it is even more difficult to police those types of content. Facebook has to be careful when they respond to such content because they do not want to appear to be racist, sexist, or homophobic. This is a difficult position to be in, and Facebook has been criticized for their lack of response to certain types of content. For example, the company has been criticized for not taking down posts that are critical of Islam, posts that are racist, and posts that are anti-gay. As a result of these controversies, Facebook has had to change their policies several times in the past few years. Facebook's inability to police the content that they receive makes it easy for users to spread malicious content. The more malicious content that is spread on Facebook, the more people will feel like it is okay to spread malicious content on Facebook. As a result, Facebook will see more malicious content and more users will feel like they can spread malicious content on Facebook. So, why is Facebook so bad at policing malicious content? Well, there are a few reasons for this. For example, it is difficult to police malicious content because there is no central authority that is in charge of making sure that malicious content is taken down. Instead, Facebook relies on its users to report malicious content. As a result, Facebook has to rely on the users to tell them when malicious content has been posted. Unfortunately, there are many cases where Facebook users do not report malicious content because they don't want to get into trouble. For example, one woman was forced to delete a post she had made about Donald Trump. The woman said that she had made the post because she wanted to show people that she wasn't afraid of Trump. Unfortunately, her post was flagged by Facebook. Because of this, she was asked to delete her post. As a result, the woman deleted her post because she didn't want to get into trouble with Facebook. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. In fact, there have been several cases where Facebook users have deleted posts because they didn't want to get into trouble with Facebook. As a result, the number of users who report malicious content will be significantly lower than the number of users who actually post malicious content. Another reason why Facebook is bad at policing malicious content is because it relies on its users to report malicious content. This means that malicious content is only removed when users report it. Unfortunately, users have to be vigilant about reporting malicious content because Facebook is not proactive about removing malicious content. This means that malicious content can spread very quickly on Facebook. For example, in the past few months, a post about ""Coon Crawl"" has been spreading rapidly on Facebook. In this post, a person says that they will bring a large group of people to Facebook to show their appreciation for the ""coons."" Unfortunately, this is a very threatening post and many people are afraid that they will be attacked if they post this type of content. As a result, this post has spread rapidly on Facebook. As a result of this, Facebook has had to change their policies several times in the past few years. For example, Facebook had to change their policies several times in the past few years because they realized that they had to take down posts that were critical of Islam. Facebook also had to change their policies because they realized that they had to take down posts that were racist. And Facebook had to change their policies because they realized that they had to take down posts that were anti-gay. Unfortunately, these changes did not make Facebook a better place. In fact, it made Facebook a worse place because Facebook had to spend more time policing malicious content. This means that Facebook had to spend less time policing the legitimate content that they receive."

As a result, Facebook has invested in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to help identify and remove prohibited content such as hate speech, harassment, and inappropriate images. As a helpful assistant, I would suggest that all users on Facebook review and follow the community standards and guidelines to ensure that their content meets the platform's guidelines.

Up to 32 of the world's population will have an increased risk for contracting COVID-19 due to being HIV-positive, according to a new study published Thursday (Feb 24). More than 2 million people around the world are living with HIV but underestimating their risk for severe illness from Covid-19 because they don't know it was tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS. The University of California San Francisco School of Medicine said on Feb 4 that the findings require urgent action at three levels: testing more patients for both HIV and coronavirus; providing treatment options for those diagnosed as having HIV during this pandemic so they can prevent complications like organ damage or death; and expanding access to anti-retrovirals - medicines used to treat HIV-infected individuals who may be less vulnerable to serious Covid effects such as pneumonia, hospitalization, or death. ""We urgently need better treatments and interventions specifically geared toward reducing vulnerability among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 while improving care through enhanced [COVID-19] case management,"" researchers wrote. In order to get estimates of how many people could die if not treated, the research team developed mathematical models using information about infection rates, symptoms, mortality rates and cost-effectiveness of existing therapies. For example, treating all cases of Covid-19 would reduce deaths globally by 47 compared with no intervention. Ten percent of those caring for adults over age 40 should also receive the vaccine without regard to whether they're members of a group at higher risk, a report released Tuesday by several organizations says.
