Human,cmv-0,"White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white girls he doesn't have much of a chance with one so he should instead pursue a non-White girl. Asian guys are penalized by their looks because I don't see them as being significantly less social, athletic, intelligent, wealthy, etc. Facial looks are genetic and cannot be changed easily. Having a fit body helps but not nearly as much as for white or black guys. I wish it weren't true. EDIT: Basically I'm saying Asian men are at a significant disadvantage in the dating scene especially if they are attracted to white women, and most comments so far seem to be confirming that view.

BigScience,cmv-0,"White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women, these same people would be shocked to see how many of their own ethnic group prefer other races. The truth is that dating culture differs from one country and region to another based on several factors such as income levels, social norms and traditions. Some cultures value relationships over sex while others do not think about it at all. In some countries it's common to marry your girlfriend or wife before they're ready emotionally but that's out by law everywhere else except where our story takes place: Thailand. In general most Thai don't only want love with the person you're going to get married to; they also like physical affection which leads them to separate themselves between this song's lyrics and actual reality. For example if you take someone who doesn't care what he looks like into his apartment and dresses him up like Brad Pitt (or any famous actor) then chances are high enough he'll still find yourself attracted even after having seen hundreds of photos of Brad Pitt wearing clothes made out of skinny jeans with sneakers on a beach somewhere because there might just be something magnetic about seeing your crush dressed like that. So when you ask Thai ladies whether she wants a relationship purely based on feelings vs sexual chemistry we can safely assume her answer will go like: I've had plenty of experiences with these guys and I'm sure I won't ever forget the first time I was taken advantage of. My boyfriend used to come home late every night so I thought I'd wait until ten o'clock to call my dad and ask why he didn't pick me up yet. Instead he went straight upstairs and instead opened the door to a room full of beautiful young Thai girlfriends waiting for him to sleep off his hangover... This happened repeatedly throughout the rest of their relationship and eventually, due to constant infighting started breaking up. When he left us, I lost hope of getting back together again and decided never really dated anyone since. But now things change! If you were single in Bangkok earlier today there'd probably be thousands of Thai girls outside bars wanting you to join them..."
OpenAI,cmv-0,"White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white girls, it is important to keep in mind that physical appearance and cultural preferences can play a role in the dating dynamics between different ethnicities. However, it is important to recognize that individual preferences and attractions vary and do not solely rely on race. As a society, it is important to promote inclusivity and avoid generalizations or stereotypes about different races and cultures."

Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women, and he may have the money to date a white woman, he will be more likely to date an Asian woman. White women do not want Asian men. The only time a white woman dates an Asian man is if he is part white, and most of the time they are also rich. So the next time you see a white woman with an Asian guy, there's a good chance he is part white. I've known white women who dated Asian men before. I think that a lot of women like Asian men because they are skinny, and they also tend to be good in bed. They also usually have good jobs. A lot of the white women I know who date Asian men, or any men for that matter, usually do it because they are ugly and can't get any man. But I don't know if that is true in this case. I would date an Asian man if he is rich, good looking, and has a good personality. I think Asian men are really attractive. But I don't think I would want to have sex with one.

BigScience,cmv-1,"I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out on a date in the past. What are my options to start dating again? Do you think there is any chance that she will give me another shot? The best way for her to help would be by not treating you as if you're some kind of weird freak and refusing to maintain contact until or unless you've changed your mind about being serious about this relationship... but I'm guessing that's difficult since she's obviously invested emotionally (even though it's only platonic) into it. Even then I'd say your chances of getting back together pretty slim. There aren't many girls like what you're saying; basically all women want each one they meet at least partially sexually involved before building anything else forward from there. So I guess I'll just be content knowing she's still interested while continuing our friendship because there's no guarantee we'll ever get back together. If she doesn't feel ready for sexual involvement yet, why continue talking to her? If she wants more time than 10 days, cut off everything - don't show up when she calls or text you anymore, stop sending emails asking how she's doing, etc., and move onto other people who might be willing (and maybe able!) to share their lives with you. Just make sure your friends know where you'd prefer them to keep an eye open so they've got something to do during those times. On the love front, I wouldn't worry too much about whether you'll see her again soon afterwards; most people take longer than ten months to recover fully from heartbreak. (Not necessarily meaning painful long-term heartbreaks like divorce.) It's easier for everyone concerned if things remain relatively amicable between you two moving forward rather than falling apart right away over a misunderstanding or minor disagreement. She was quite specific about wanting nothing physical going forward but did mention if he wanted to explore there were ways to do it without hurting her feelings. Nice touch on his part. OP, as far as I can tell, she hasn't said ""yes"" yet-which doesn't mean there's nowhere near 100 of a 'no' either. She clearly knows you're looking for a relationship now, which suggests she may still be somewhat attracted to you. Keep communicating and seeing how she reacts to your messages: does she respond defensively or flirtatively? Does she simply ignore you altogether? In terms of behavior, I'm glad you made the decision to cease communication with her. It's certainly better for both parties to stay non-threatening here, especially as it's implied that her lack of interest is related to being uninterested in pursuing a romantic relationship further. Whether OP elects to leave entirely or merely reduce interactions depending on how aggressive she becomes towards him remains unclear given her current state-of-mind. PI:USER We've written numerous posts covering exactly issues relating to romantic relationships including the below topics There's also plenty of advice regarding friendships on this site including what's appropriate to ask questionsget answers from others based on differences in gender andor orientation"

They're here for the same reason as B, but they had to sneak in. A buys some fireworks from a fireworks store, which they are legally allowed to do.

Question: Should all three be charged with the same crime? Your answer to this question may determine whether or not you're a conservative. This entry was posted in Crime and Punishment, Politics and tagged fireworks, illegal alien. Bookmark the permalink. Both B and C are illegal. A is not. How is that determined? I have to assume that A is a US citizen, since it says they are a huge idiot and that is not an automatic disqualification. It is an automatic disqualification to be an illegal alien. And if we are talking about the same crime, the same crime is: 1. Buying fireworks without a license, 2. Purchasing fireworks without an ID 3. Possessing fireworks without a license 4. Lighting off fireworks without a permit 5. Releasing air pollutants without a permit 6. Releasing light pollutants without a permit 7. Releasing sound pollutants without a permit 8. Violating a city ordinance 9. Violating a county ordinance 10. Violating a state law 11. Violating a federal law I think that is the same crime. Having said all of that, I think that there is a difference between an illegal alien and a person who is here legally. And the difference is that one has no rights under the law, and the other does. I think that A, B and C all should be charged with the same crimes, because all three of them are citizens of the same country, which is the USA. Jeff, you don't even understand the point of the post. Try reading the title again. Pingback: ""Should all three be charged with the same crime?"" "" Jeff Vader's Lounge I think I do understand the point of the post. If Person A, B, and C have violated the same law, then they should be charged with the same crime. The fact that B and C are illegal immigrants has nothing to do with their right to break the law. There are no special rights for US citizens and no special laws that apply to illegal aliens. Because all three are citizens of the United States, they all should be charged with the same crime. You are trying to set up a false dichotomy: that one must be a conservative to think that A, B and C should be charged with the same crime. However, your premise is false. If you want to set up a false dichotomy, you might say: If someone wants to set up a false dichotomy, they are not a conservative. However, that would be a false dichotomy. If you want to make a statement about conservatism, you should probably talk to some actual conservatives. Jeff, we'll just have to agree to disagree. I have no doubt you are a conservative. I have no doubt that you believe the illegal aliens should be charged with the same crime as the citizen. It's not a false dichotomy. It's a question about the legal status of illegal aliens, and how that legal status should affect their treatment. I don't think it should. You do. That's the point of the post."

PaLM,cmv-3,"I was a spoiled lazy teenager. I didn’t have a job, and I didn’t do much of anything to help out around the house. My parents were always nagging me to get a job, but I didn’t want to. I was too busy playing video games and hanging out with my friends. One day, my parents had enough. They sat me down and told me that I had to get a job or I was going to be kicked out of the house. I was shocked. I didn’t realize that they were serious. I thought they were just blowing off steam. But they were serious. They gave me a week to find a job, or I was out. I was scared. I didn’t know what I was going to do. I had never had a job before, and I didn’t know how to find one. I started applying for jobs everywhere. I went to the mall, I went online, I even put an ad in the newspaper. But I didn’t have any luck. No one wanted to hire me. I was starting to get desperate. I didn’t know what I was going to do. I was about to give up when I saw a sign for a job fair at the local community college. I decided to go check it out. The job fair was a bust. There were a lot of people there, but there weren’t many jobs. I talked to a few employers, but they all said they were looking for experienced workers. I was about to leave when I saw a booth for a company called “The Temp Agency.” I decided to talk to them. They told me that they were looking for temps to work in a variety of different businesses. I applied for a job, and they hired me on the spot. I was so happy. I finally had a job! The job wasn’t glamorous. I worked in a warehouse, packing boxes. But it was a job. I was making money, and I was learning new skills. After a few months, I got a permanent job at a different company. I was making more money, and I was doing something that I was good at. I’m so glad that my parents made me get a job. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. It taught me the value of hard work, and it helped me to become a responsible adult. If you’re a teenager who doesn’t have a job, I urge you to get one. It will be hard at first, but it will be worth it. A job will teach you valuable skills, and it will help you to become a better person. Here are some tips for getting a job:  Start by looking for jobs that you’re qualified for. If you don’t have any experience, look for entry-level positions.  Network with your friends and family. See if they know of any job openings.  Attend job fairs. This is a great way to meet potential employers and learn about different job opportunities.  Apply for jobs online. This is a convenient way to apply for jobs, and you can do it from anywhere.  Don’t give up. It takes time to find a job. Keep applying for jobs, and eventually you will find one."

I was a spoiled lazy It's never too late to change your ways! Depending on your current situation and goals, any of these options could work for you: - (A) If you're currently in high school and want to start being more independent and responsible, working part-time during the school year and full-time during summers can be a great way to earn money, gain work experience, and start saving for college or other goals. This can also help you develop time management skills and a work ethic that will benefit you in college and beyond. - (B) If you're currently not in school and need to work to support yourself financially, working full-time before going to college can be a smart choice. This can help you save up for tuition, build up your resume and skills, and figure out what you want to study and pursue in college. You may also be able to take advantage of employer tuition assistance or reimbursement programs to help with the cost of college. - (C) If you're currently in college, working part-time or even full-time while you study can be a great way to earn money, gain experience, and offset the cost of tuition and living expenses. This can also help you develop skills and connections that will be valuable in your future career. However, it's important to balance work and school responsibilities, so make sure to prioritize your studies and take care of your mental and physical health. Ultimately, the key is to be proactive and intentional about your goals and priorities, and to be willing to put in the effort and hard work required to achieve them. Good luck!"

I was a spoiled lazy rich kid, and I didn't do any of those things. My parents had no problem with me wasting their money. I did work for a while in college. I was the head of the admissions office for a public university in the '80s, and I got to meet the top 10 of the high school graduating class. I asked them about their plans, and most of them had already accepted full-ride scholarships from the university, so they had no financial need. They just wanted to be part of the exclusive fraternity of college students. I told them I had a different plan for them. ""You know,"" I said, ""I have an offer for you. I'm looking for a full-time worker. I'll pay you 3,000 a year to work full-time, and you can use the rest of your money for college. Would you be interested?"" I received more than 50 applications, but only one student took me up on my offer. He went to college and did just fine. I wasn't really trying to help him, but I did like to see him succeed. That's what I'm doing now. I'm writing a book about working while you go to college, and I want to help people like my student. Working part-time in high school isn't bad, but you have to have the money to do it. Most people don't. Working full-time before you go to college is better, but you have to be able to support yourself, too. Working while you study in college is better than the other two, but it's a lot more work. I like working while you study in college, because it forces you to take responsibility for your education. You have to take classes, and you have to get good grades. You can't just take the easy classes, and you can't just study for tests. The classes are tough, and you have to learn what you're studying. You also have to keep your grades up. If you flunk a class, you have to pay to take the class again. You can't just walk away from the class and never pay to take it again. If you do that, the professor will have to tell the school you're an unreliable student, and they will stop offering you credit for the class. If you get a bad grade in a class, you have to retake it. If you fail to get a good grade in a class, you have to pay to take the class again. I'm telling you all this so you can understand the value of a college education. If you don't go to college, you can always go to a community college. It's a good way to start learning about a subject, and it's free. But you'll have to repeat a lot of the same classes. The money you save on community college won't be worth it. Most of the people I've interviewed who were born poor or grew up poor never went to college. They went to community college, but they couldn't afford to go to a four-year college. If you don't have a lot of money, you have to go to college. The money you save by going to community college won't be worth it. You'll end up working for more money than you would have working in a job. The money you save by going to community college won't be worth it. The best advice I can give you is to work part-time in high school, and then go to college. If you work full-time before you go to college, you'll end up working for more money than you would have working in a job. If you work while you study in college, you'll learn a lot more than you would have learning in a job. If you do work while you study in college, you'll have to work really hard. If you don't do that, you won't get good grades, and you won't learn what you're studying. I'm telling you all this so you can understand the value of a college education. If you don't go to college, you can always go to a community college. It's a good way to start learning about a subject, and it's free. But you'll have to repeat a lot of the same classes.

Human,cmv-3,"(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy kid because I never got a job. Had my priorities mixed up and flunked. I got a job in the real world, and it was painful, but humbling. If I had gotten a job at 18 (or sooner), I would've done much better in college and learned crucial life lessons sooner. There's also lots of other people who are deluded and spoiled because they don't work. I won't allow my kids to go to college without having worked first. I'm not restricting this purely to retail, but retail teaches humility. It teaches you how to be diplomatic, how you're not the center of the universe, sometimes you have to tolerate shit, things won't always go your way. And after working a retail job, you'll treat other retail workers with more respect. Having a job also teaches the reality of the world versus theory. I used to be a hardcore Republican who thought poor people didn't have it THAT bad and wealthy people deserve to live 100x better because they work harder. Now, I see the real challenges average people face, especially in the ghetto. Having real world experience will help you just as much (you'll encounter lots of people, learn your strengths and weaknesses), if not more than spending years in college ""finding yourself."" If you have no idea what you want to do in college, you're going to waste lots of time. Lots of college kids are entitled because parentsgovernment pay for everything. And they think they automatically deserve a high-paying job just because they graduated. Nope, gotta work your way up from the bottom. Nobody's too good for an entry-level job.

Human,cmv-4,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether they are doing it to decrease chances of accidents or they are revenue raising, the power still lies completely in the hand of the person behind the wheel. Even if the police had the intention of revenue raising, that money still goes toward hiring more officers, putting more police cars on the road and getting better technology to combat road accidents. They aren't making anyone speed, they are just making the best of the fact that people are going to speed, so they might as well bring some revenue in from it. Edit: I should have clarified that I am referring exclusively to traffic offences eg. Speeding, drink driving etc. Edit: My view has been changed. I now see that the motivations behind revenue raising contradict the motivations that the police service is created to have. If revenue raising was the goal, the Police service would not only be out for the wrong reasons, but the entire outcome of what they would achieve would be counterproductive to society as a whole. Due to this, revenue raising cannot be seen as morally sound."
OpenAI,cmv-4,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether the motivation behind implementing a new form of speed prevention is to generate revenue or to increase road safety, the effects should still result in a reduction of speeding on the roads. However, it is important for law enforcement agencies to prioritize road safety and communicate clearly with the community about the reasons and goals behind new initiatives. Effective communication can help build trust and support for traffic safety measures."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-4,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether you're speeding because someone made your car go faster than its top end was designed for (and ""gave"" to) by design; whether this is done as part and parcel with responsible financial management in respectful recognition that driving can be fun but not at other people's expense - if there are bad guys willing en masse enough ready-made ways around any kind cost saving measure introduced then their attempts will always render these ineffective regardless how well intentioned those introducing them might have been: If I may offer an analogy from my life so far about all types such issues being faced today under our current system represented hereabouts... erm.........

Tsinghua,cmv-4,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether the motivation is revenue generation, better management of road safety, or even if it's for some combination of all three, what does matter is the actual outcome. As I wrote earlier, the ultimate measure of any safety measure is the reduction in the number of injuries and deaths. Whether or not a police crackdown results in a net reduction in speeders, it's still a net reduction in the number of people injured or killed. There's a lot of evidence that the use of radars to catch speeders can be effective. The study by Pothoven and Layne (2009) shows that a radar crackdown in the Netherlands led to a 21 percent reduction in fatalities. They also found that the reduction in deaths was concentrated in the places where the crackdown took place. But if you want to compare the effectiveness of the Dutch crackdown with a police crackdown in the US, you need to look at the states that use radar. Pothoven and Layne (2009) found that, between 1999 and 2006, states that use radar to catch speeders had a 33 percent reduction in the number of fatalities. What about the effectiveness of speed cameras? I can't find any study that shows the effectiveness of speed cameras on reducing the number of fatalities, but the data from Pothoven and Layne (2009) shows that speed cameras in the US do lead to a reduction in the number of speeders. The only data that I can find on the effectiveness of speed cameras is the information from the National Safety Council (2007). They analyzed 10 years of data from speed camera enforcement zones in 34 states. The study found that the use of speed cameras in these areas reduced the number of crashes by 13 percent. If you combine the data from Pothoven and Layne (2009) and the National Safety Council (2007), the data shows that speed cameras in the US reduce the number of speeders by 22 percent and the number of fatalities by 25 percent. And I think the data shows that the police crackdowns that are carried out in the US can be effective. The police in Boston, for example, have had success in the past using a combination of radar and speed cameras. One study (Meyer, 2003) found that a 30 percent reduction in the number of speeders in the Boston area resulted in a 21 percent reduction in the number of deaths. If we take the data from Pothoven and Layne (2009) and the National Safety Council (2007) together, the data shows that a police crackdown in the US can reduce the number of speeders by 33 percent and the number of fatalities by 38 percent. I'm not saying that speed cameras are the solution to all of the world's traffic problems, but they do seem to be a good solution to some of them."
LLAMA,cmv-4,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether it's about safety or revenue, it's the perception that you'll get caught that matters, a new study shows. A recent report from the Institute for Transportation Engineers says that traffic enforcement programs can be used as both a tool to reduce crashes and increase revenue for the jurisdiction, but it should be made clear which is the primary goal. The authors looked at two types of speed enforcement programs in the United States to see how they affected driver behavior: automated speed enforcement (ASE) and specialized traffic enforcement zones (STEZ). ASE involves things like photo radar cameras and red light cameras. Drivers get tickets in the mail. STEZs are used to increase enforcement on major highways and arterial roads that have high crash rates. The idea is to make drivers more aware of the road conditions. Drivers don't really care about the motivation behind speed enforcement, the report found, as long as they think they're being watched. Researchers looked at five ASE programs in Arizona, California, Maryland, New Jersey and Washington. In all five, the majority of drivers said they didn't know how the money from the programs was used. The researchers interviewed 18 law enforcement officials and found that in half of the programs, ASE was used to generate revenue, while in the other half, it was used to increase safety. But it's not the motivation that matters. It's the perception that drivers are being watched that changes behavior, the report found. ""Regardless of whether the purpose is primarily safety or revenue, it is important for the public to be aware that speed enforcement is in effect,"" the report says. The researchers looked at the effects of STEZs in 23 states, and found that in all of them, the law enforcement officials said the primary purpose was to increase safety. However, the researchers found that in 14 states, STEZs were also used for revenue generation. Again, drivers don't care about the motivation. They just need to think they're being watched. ""Because the purpose of speed enforcement is to alter driver behavior, it is important that drivers perceive the purpose of the enforcement activity,"" the report says. ""The way enforcement activity is presented to the public may affect driver perception of the purpose of the activity, and thus may influence whether drivers actually modify their behavior."""
BigScience,cmv-4,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether you feel more aware about being safe driving in an area where you're not allowed to get away with that kind of behavior is irrelevant. But if it's my goal as a policeman and driver to drive safely I should pay attention to those factors which could have the desired effect (as well as other things). Of course there are still many road users who simply don't care for traffic laws at all. But these people do exist and we need to be able to work towards reducing their impact. A: What motivates me to act properly? Is it fear? Some studies suggest that, when drivers know they're getting caught by law enforcement officers, they tend to: Drive slower Stay closer to stop signs Watch out for cars coming from unexpected directions. Take evasive action rather than risk going against the flow. The reason might also vary: some people may think ""we always do this"" while others find it difficult to admit being wrong can't control themselves. In any case, there's something special about knowing that your actions will cause problems for yourself andor someone else. It's been documented that such knowledge increases sensitivity to situations involving danger. If none of this works how can we motivate ourselves to behave correctly? Well....if we're honest we'll probably judge ourselves based solely upon what happened yesterday and won't realize we've gone off-track until tomorrow morning when our performance slips again. (See point 1 - since we never really learn anything unless that's immediately experienced). I asked myself once why I'd go too fast and found two points were crucially important: It felt good! This made me feel better about myself! The first one was easy enough to understand but what's interesting here is that I'm sure you'll agree that having positive feelings toward oneself isn't necessarily true evidence that one's behaviour is appropriate. However, we often forget about the second factor because most beginners usually fall into negative thinking traps like ""if only..."" or ""I'm so lazy.."" etc. A lot has changed over time. How much money am I making? (point 2 above) I'm pretty sure that during adolescence we'd want to prove ourselves worthy somehow and reckless driving would certainly fit the bill. But today - on average - each citizen earns nearly twice as much per year! So now we experience less pressure to try hard just to impress everyone around us and become successful in life. Plus even old habits die slow though... As far as I remember, I've already seen several books published describing ways ""to avoid temptation"" including specific tips like: ""If you know you must buy candy before dinner, eat 1 piece instead of 2. By doing so you'd get rid of desire without eating everything you've bought beforehand."" So let me ask you: Do you honestly believe that every single person sitting next to you on the bus got up early and drove herselfhimself there? The answer is: No. And yet - every day we see similar stories related to family members and friends. Remembering the essay ""The Perils of Fast Food Culture"" written 10 years ago by Miguel de Icaza, author of Fluffy Delicious!, he suggests that: Technology offers great opportunities for enabling effective education both within schools and outside them. At home parents can use technology effectively; They can provide content relevant to students' current age, And connect students directly with experts. In schools teachers can create innovative pedagogical models using the power of computers. He goes on to refer specifically to educational games marketed under the name ""Train Yourself"": These games allow children to develop their basic mathematical skills, visual literacy, reading comprehension, writing skills; They encourage curiosity, creativity, Independent thought, problem solving capacity, Understanding of emotions, (and) empathy. (source) Doesn't sound very impressive huh? For example, when children play Tetris ... the information processing load is reduced considerably compared to playing traditional computer games. ...since mental exercises (such as logical reasoning or spatial visualization tasks) are carried out simultaneously with gameplay. But wait! There're additional benefits! We mentioned earlier that teenagers seem to enjoy recreational activities, especially board games, sports events, movies music festivals.... the list is endless!. Now imagine this: kids are learning math and logic stuff while actively enjoying entertainment. (from ""Smart Learning Games Another study describes how students participating in online projects benefit from: developing strong inter-personal relations, improving expression abilities, increasing self confidence, not to mention increased satisfaction with schoolwork. One final comment: This shouldn't come as a surprise. It turns out that modern technologies offer tremendous potential not only to support teachinglearning processes inside classrooms but also extend them beyond them. Imagine a virtual campus containing hundreds or thousands of physical buildings connected via Internet connections! Imagine real-life environments designed specifically for practical applications, e.g., simulation labs allowing students to practise its theoretical aspects and then comparing results with data gathered in actual conditions. A Virtual Reality scenario allows a student to test hisher reactions to different kinds of stimuli. Alternatively, heshe is encouraged to: create her own scenarios analyzing the answers provided by the algorithms [..]"
PaLM,cmv-5,"Using chopsticks is at best a cultural preference and not really a superior eating utensil. There are a few reasons for this. First, chopsticks are not as versatile as forks and knives. They can only be used to pick up food that is already cut into small pieces, while forks and knives can be used to cut food and then eat it. Second, chopsticks are more difficult to use than forks and knives. It takes practice to become proficient at using chopsticks, and even then, it can be difficult to eat certain foods, such as soup or spaghetti. Third, chopsticks are not as sanitary as forks and knives. They are often made of wood or bamboo, which can harbor bacteria. Forks and knives, on the other hand, are usually made of metal, which is easier to clean. Of course, there are also some advantages to using chopsticks. They are lightweight and portable, so they are easy to take with you when you are eating out. They are also relatively inexpensive, making them a good option for people who are on a budget. And finally, chopsticks can be used to eat a wider variety of foods than forks and knives. For example, chopsticks can be used to eat rice, noodles, and dumplings, which can be difficult to eat with a fork and knife. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use chopsticks is a personal one. There are pros and cons to both options, and the best choice for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. Here are some additional tips for using chopsticks:  Hold the chopsticks in your dominant hand with your thumb and index finger on one chopstick and your middle finger on the other.  Use your non-dominant hand to hold the food and bring it close to the chopsticks.  Use the bottom chopstick to push the food onto the top chopstick.  Practice makes perfect! The more you use chopsticks, the easier they will become to use. So, if you are ever feeling adventurous, give chopsticks a try. You might be surprised at how easy they are to use and how much you enjoy them."

Tsinghua,cmv-5,"I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking ""Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery."" Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing and at worst, simply an exercise in frustration. I am a giver, not a taker, so the whole ""Let me get you a plate of something"" makes me uncomfortable. I'm not going to pass on the opportunity to give to you if I'm comfortable doing it, so I just get you something from the fridge or put it in your hand. It's not a huge thing, but it's a difference I can feel. People with Asian parents will get this. I have a friend whose parents immigrated from Taiwan, and they had this kind of training. She had a conversation with her boyfriend, who was from the United States, about this, and he couldn't understand why she didn't just get her own plate. She told him that her parents always gave her a plate. He replied, ""You mean you don't have to get your own plate?."" It's funny, because she did get her own plate. But it's an Asian thing to pass on a plate, and if you are from the US, you are just used to getting your own plate. But I can tell you, it's not that big of a deal. When you are at someone's house, especially if you are just being invited over for a meal, it is considered rude to refuse to take a plate. It's the same as asking for a drink or food. You take a drink, you take a bite of food, and if you don't like it, you ask for another, but it's not polite to just pass it off to someone else. If you are not comfortable doing this, it's okay to ask for a plate. But don't be offended if they offer to give you a plate. I just realized that this isn't even about the plate, it's just that I am used to not having to ask for a plate. I don't even really have to ask for a drink, it's usually just passed to me, and if I don't want it, I ask for another. This whole thing about getting a plate is just cultural, and it is different for everyone. I'm going to have to try and get my own plate, and I'm going to have to try and explain to my friend that he is not going to get a plate. Is the U.S. Too Fast for You?tag:,2011:theblog3.-10T17:46:01-04:002011-08-10T17:46:01-04:00Annemarie Svanborghttp:www.huffingtonpost.comannemarie-svanborg In the 1980s, when I first arrived in the United States, I felt like a fish out of water. I was 16 and was the only person in my family who had ever been outside of Sweden. I had lived in a small town with 500 people. My parents wanted me to be Americanized, so I went to a local junior high school, but I was a complete outsider. I didn't understand the American ways, the language, the music, or the clothes. I felt different, and I didn't like it. I was also nervous about making friends, because I didn't know what I was doing. I just felt so lonely. Fast forward 25 years. I'm 38, have a job, and am making good money. I live in the suburbs of Seattle with my husband and two children. We have a nice house and a nice car. We have a lot of nice things. I can say that I am a well-adjusted, happy American. But, the more I have become a part of American society, the more I have felt a sense of loss. I feel like I am missing something. The United States is the most powerful country in the world, and I'm proud to be an American, but I feel like the United States is too fast for me. There is too much going on. The pace of life is too fast. I am tired of always being on the go. I am tired of having to check email constantly. I am tired of always being stressed out. I am tired of always being in a hurry. I want to be able to take a break. I want to relax. I want to be able to enjoy the things I have. I want to be able to savor life."
OpenAI,cmv-5,"I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking ""Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery."" Using chopsticks is at best a cultural tradition and requires some practice to master. Here are some tips that might help you improve your chopstick skills: 1. Choose chopsticks that are comfortable to grip and maneuver. If you are a beginner, it may be easier to start with chopsticks that have grooves to help you grip food better. 2. Hold the chopsticks correctly by placing one between your thumb and index finger and the other between your thumb and middle finger. The bottom chopstick should be stationary, while the upper chopstick should move up and down to grip food. 3. Practice picking up small, round objects like nuts or grapes first. Once you have mastered this, move on to other foods like noodles, rice or meat. 4. When eating, hold the chopsticks at the end, and avoid using them to gesture or play with your food. 5. Keep your hands steady and be patient. It takes practice to use chopsticks properly, so don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away. Remember that using chopsticks is a skill that requires patience and practice. With time, you will become more comfortable and proficient in using them."

Using chopsticks is at best a cultural norm in Asia and not necessarily how you are expected to eat your food there. You have no idea what I was up against when my first day of work started as an Executive Assistant with a very old company who would be cool if they were called some other name altogether like ""Mister or Madam President"" (all formalities in the world - and he even introduced me by his title). Then one morning we had lunch together and for dessert we each got a sugar cookie...because that's all he wanted from us. We asked him why every time someone ate anything sweet they always get cookies? He said because this person has just come into their house and should feel welcome so it's nice to give them something sugary. That's about it though... Anyway, I've been trying to learn Japanese for two years now, and am working on picking out items off google translate right now! So far I'm only able to say ""Excuse me"" which is pretty basic but I do know enough to try communicating simple tasks myself. (The phone number of the photocopier seems hard to type.) My problem comes down to pronunciation andor grammarI guess my brain doesn't act like its own language so I can't tell what's going on inside it? (Or maybe I don't want to?) Sounds familiar, especially since I went through the same thing back in August September last year after visiting Japan. Wasn't sure whether to leave comments here until I thought I'd checked more thoroughly before posting again! Not forgetting how scared frustrated everyone must've felt upon hearing the phrase ""excarnis"" instead of ""excuses"" Edit: Also realized there's another question posted today related to 'trying' to succeed in communication during times when speaking English isn't possible: How does native speaker communicate sarcasm? Yes, definitely sounds a lot like my experience; although mine was in Korea rather than Hong Kong. Probably helped also being away from home for several days while learning Chinese, so getting accustomed to different accent and style of speech. I think I still can remember how stressed I used to get too -I spoke slowly and ickyly compared to my normal speed of conversation and I tried my best to sound polite and professional at all times. Still managed to make mistakes once in a while, but hey, we're human. Also it happened quite suddenlyI didn't notice any difference between my previous behavior and new emerging tendency till I finished internship and came back. There's plenty of protection available - both voluntary and compulsory - designed to help protect children online. But sadly, these measures aren't always followed, making parents increasingly worried about their kids' safety online. In fact, according to reports compiled by the government in 2017 over 30 percent of UK youngsters aged 11-16 admitted having experienced cyberbullying whilst at school, meaning half of England's teenagers have likely suffered bullying online. These statistics alone highlight the importance of keeping our eyes peeled for signs that indicate digital abuse may be taking place but it's equally important to understand exactly what constitutes cyber-bullying and how you can respond - regardless of if you're the victim or perpetrator yourself. Cyber-bullying is defined simply as 'any unwanted behaviour involving texting, emailing or social media messages directed towards others'. It's generally understood that victims appear to suffer psychological injury due to the continuous hurtful words aimed directly at their mental health. That harm doesn't stop there however, research shows perpetrators often post abusive content online including photos and videos depicting violence that could possibly escalate to physical assault later on. When deciding whether someone's causing real distress, you're advised to consider things such as:"

BigScience,cmv-6,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing this point here but I'd like to suggest a more subtle slippery: It's already lawful for two men or women of same gender to marry each other and that's why they can't be married between them as well. But if you'd been thinking about it you might notice something else: Nowadays we have different kinds of consensus involving different levels of social authority where adults may agree with some rules (consensus) while rejecting others at another level (rejection). For example, when it comes to child abuse, experts disagree over whether kids should face punishment for sexual misbehaviour. (There are no agreed-upon standards concerning such behaviour.) Our society allows consensual sex outside marriage but doesn't allow children under age 18 to get married so there is disagreement within our society itself regarding what ought to happen to those involved: Should they spend their life between bars? Or should they sit down and write an honest-to-God apology letter? It seems likely then that the time has come now for us to find ways around these conventional limits placed upon couples who want to live together without having the benefits of legally recognised relationships between themselves. We cannot make peace by repressing all homoerotic desire - even though I haven't seen any evidence which suggests that doing so will stop anyone from trying to fuck each other's brains out. They need only look into how we've managed recently to reach settlement agreements after war crimes atrocities against humanity have taken place. The world could benefit greatly if governments showed less blindness towards those committed to committing mass murder. A lot of homosexuals don't view being homo-romantic, or romantic with someone else of one's own gender, simply as part of everyday human nature based on biological urges; rather they're convinced that heterosexism and traditional values must fall from grace because mainstream values conflict directly with their belief system. That's especially true amongst younger generations. The problem you're talking about, however, isn't necessarily one of homosexuality per se at all, but rather one of acceptance of cultural norms among middle-aged or older white males generally. Many young straight folks aren't really concerned with promoting integration either at least none who's influenced me personally have any interest whatsoever, despite some opinions I've read online which seem to indicate otherwise, but many do see marrying their partner from across the aisle as somewhat important symbolically speaking whereas I think there's still plenty of room for love regardless of your spiritual beliefs. I am single and currently enjoying my freedom with another woman. We have always said ""we"" instead of ""I,"" made decisions jointly etc., although it's never been complete equality since she's far worse off financially than i'm. When i was told ""you hurt her,"" I realized he thought we were just friends. While i didn't feel 'hurt' anymore, his words came through loud clear - that i had betrayed him! He refused to believe i'd ever wanted anything negative going forward with her, insisting we both loved her equally...but deep down inside neither did! This guy tried to rationalize himself away saying i know i've done wrong but he loves her enough to forgive me. He doesn't understand when you're dealt bad cards its easier to keep playing...

Tsinghua,cmv-6,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing against this position here. My point is that if there is an argument against polygamy, then the same argument could equally be made against gay marriage. However, the law doesn't always apply the same to every human right. I can't think of a single reason why we should deny polygamous marriages the same protections and privileges that gay marriage currently enjoys."
LLAMA,cmv-6,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing for or against the legalisation of gay marriage here, but I do think there's an interesting philosophical point to be made about the slippery slope argument. The slippery slope argument is a simple modus ponens argument. P1: If gay marriage is legalised, then polygamous marriage will be legalised. P2: If polygamous marriage is legalised, then it will be the end of civilization as we know it. C1: If gay marriage is legalised, then it will be the end of civilization as we know it. I think the slippery slope argument fails for the following reasons: 1. The slippery slope argument is not necessarily true. P1 is false: the legalisation of gay marriage does not necessarily lead to the legalisation of polygamous marriage. The slippery slope argument assumes that the barriers that prevent gay marriage from being legalised are the same as the barriers that prevent polygamous marriage from being legalised. However, this is not true. There are many more barriers to polygamous marriage than there are to gay marriage, and the legalisation of gay marriage will not change any of those barriers. 2. Even if P1 is true, P2 is not necessarily true: the legalisation of polygamous marriage does not necessarily lead to the end of civilization as we know it. The slippery slope argument assumes that the barriers to polygamous marriage being legalised are the same as the barriers to the end of civilization as we know it. However, this is not true. There are many more barriers to the end of civilization as we know it than there are to polygamous marriage, and the legalisation of polygamous marriage will not change any of those barriers. 3. Even if P1 and P2 are true, C1 is not necessarily true: the legalisation of gay marriage does not necessarily lead to the end of civilization as we know it. The slippery slope argument assumes that the barriers to gay marriage being legalised are the same as the barriers to the end of civilization as we know it. However, this is not true. There are many more barriers to the end of civilization as we know it than there are to gay marriage, and the legalisation of gay marriage will not change any of those barriers. However, even if I am right and the slippery slope argument is a bad argument, it doesn't follow that gay marriage should be legalised. The slippery slope argument is not the only argument against gay marriage, and one could say that the slippery slope argument is a bad argument without implying that gay marriage should be legalised. I just think that the slippery slope argument is a bad argument. Hmmm. I think that slippery slope arguments are generally poor, but in this case, I think it might be a bit more than just an argument from analogy. It's a bit different from what I understand to be a slippery slope argument, in that it's an argument to the effect of ""if we change the law on marriage in this way, then that will pave the way for other changes to the law on marriage."" I agree that there are different kinds of arguments that one might call ""slippery slope arguments."" I think that the slippery slope argument against gay marriage is an argument from analogy, but I think that there is another kind of slippery slope argument that is not an argument from analogy. I think that that kind of slippery slope argument is what you're referring to. I agree that the slippery slope argument in that case is a bad argument, because there is no reason to think that changing the law on gay marriage would change the law on polygamous marriage. There is a slippery slope argument in the legalization of gay marriage, but I believe it is more in the rights of religious organizations. For instance, if gay marriage is legalized then it might be required of Catholic Charities to adopt out children to gay parents. The slippery slope then would be that Catholic Charities, due to its moral views, would no longer be able to adopt children out because it would be required to do so to gay couples. I think that this is actually a good argument, and it's an example of a slippery slope argument that's not an argument from analogy. I agree that the slippery slope argument that you describe is not a bad argument, and that it's"
Human,cmv-6,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing whether or not this will happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse's other spouse, although you could choose to do this. While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? It's natural for humans to live in groups.'Tribes' or'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment. To be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them. People sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. A big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don't think that's necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn't this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you're married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document. I'm not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person's ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don't think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn't mean that I'm against other people having the option. I'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don't want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason. So please try to CMV! I'm going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really ped off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them.

Edit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually! Edit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: ""While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.""

OpenAI,cmv-6,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing about whether or not gay marriage should be legal or the merits of the slippery slope argument, but I can provide you with some information. The slippery slope argument suggests that if we allow one thing to happen (in this case, gay marriage), it will lead to the allowance of other things (such as polygamy). While it is true that some people may use this argument to argue against gay marriage, it is worth noting that not all slippery slope arguments are invalid. However, it's worth noting that legalising one thing doesn't necessarily justify legalising another. Each issue should be evaluated on its own merits, and the fact that one thing is legalised doesn't automatically mean that others will follow suit. In the case of gay marriage and polygamy, they are separate issues that should be addressed individually. It is also important to recognise that there is a difference between consenting adults entering into a marriage and non-consensual arrangements. While polygamy may be considered taboo in some societies, there are people who choose to practice it and it can be a consensual arrangement between adults. Ultimately, discussions about the legalisation of certain forms of marriage should be properly evaluated based on their own merits and drawbacks rather than using alarmist and slippery slope arguments."
Tsinghua,cmv-7,"So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, and somethings are not. I am a christian, a catholic. I am not anti-american, anti-european, anti-socialist, anti-whatever. I am anti-idiots. People who lie, who try to fool people and say things that are just not true. And people who take advantage of the general ignorance and naivety of others. The same applies to the government and politicians, of course. And I have been very disappointed in how much of that has been happening. But I have always thought that politicians are just people like the rest of us, and it is just that we do not see them that way. Well, I do now. I do not like the current state of things. The government of the USA has been put in a position where it is impossible for them to be responsible for anything that is done in the USA. They are simply not allowed to do anything right, and in many ways, I think that they are not allowed to do anything wrong either. I have read the constitution of the USA, and I can not find anywhere in there that the president is in charge of anything. They are simply to advise the people, and in case the president does something that he or she should not, it is the people who can make him or her change it. The constitution also says that the president should be honest and trustworthy, and that he or she should not take part in the politics. They can only advise. So the president can not do anything right, and in many ways he or she is not allowed to do anything wrong either. That is how it is written in the constitution, and I do not think that that is fair. It is unfair for the American people. That is what I think, and that is what I feel. It is my opinion, and it is not a law. I am just writing down what I think. I can not make anyone believe it, and I can not make anyone not believe it. But I think that people who believe that the president is the only person who can be responsible for what is done in the USA, and that the president is the only person who can be trusted, need to think again. If the president does something that is wrong, he or she should be voted out of office. The same goes for the people who support the president. I think that the USA needs a new president, and that the current president should be voted out of office. But I do not think that the current president is responsible for what is done in the USA. He or she is not the only person who is responsible. I think that the people who are in charge of the USA are also responsible. I do not want to go into detail here, because I am sure that you are all familiar with the main players. But I think that it is important to say that the president is not the only person who is responsible for what is done in the USA. The people who are in charge of the USA are also responsible. That is my opinion, and I am not writing down anything that I have not thought and felt for a long time. I do not have any proof, because it is not a law. It is my opinion, and I think that it is important to share my opinion with everyone. So, in conclusion: I think that the president is not the only person who is responsible for what is done in the USA. I think that the people who are in charge of the USA are also responsible. I think that the president should be voted out of office. I think that the current president should be voted out of office. I think that it is important to share my opinion with everyone. That is all. And that is my opinion. I do not want to start a debate, or anything like that. I just want to share my opinion with everyone. And I hope that you will understand me, and that you will think about what I have written. Thanks for listening. ""That is all. And that is my opinion. I do not want to start a debate, or anything like that. I just want to share my opinion with everyone. And I hope that you will understand me, and that you will think about what I have written.

With that said I find it kind of scary that there is a Clinton and a Bush in this election. The kings in Denmark used to be elected, some thousand years ago, but then it became normal to elect kings from the same familly. Then latter it was always the oldest son and then we endeed up with the system where the king was always the oldest son from the old king. The same is more or less true in many other countries. People seem to rather want to vote on people from families they know than random people. To me it kind of seems like America is getting set in their political dynasties and that if this development continues, we might end up with a system where everyone in theory can try to be elected president, but in practise it will always be people from the same political dynasties that gets elected.

LLAMA,cmv-7,"So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, and some of the things you guys do and talk about are funny. But most things I dont really care about. The same way you probably dont care about what is happening in Denmark. This being said, I have to comment on some of the things I hear and see. First of all, I have a problem with the way the healthcare debate is being held. It is just a mess. The way you guys debate is just ridiculous. I will not go in depth with the healthcare system, but I have a few things to say, that might interest you. First of all, I do not agree with your healthcare system. It is fundamentally flawed, in the way that it does not serve the people. What is important in a healthcare system is that it is fair, efficient and effective. I am not saying that the danish system is perfect, but we do have a very high standard of healthcare. Now, there are some things that I think you should be aware of. First of all the danish system is not ""socialised medicine."" We do not have a national healthcare. We have a system that is basically private insurances, but controlled by the government. What this means, is that the government set the standards, and have full oversight over the system. It also means that the companies that are insuring people are not allowed to make profits on the healthcare. If they do, they are punished by the government. I do not think that this system is perfect, but it is one way to ensure that everyone get the treatment they need. But, what you guys need to understand is that the government does not control the medical system in Denmark. What the government does is set the standards for the system, and then let the companies compete for customers. So what does this mean for us danes, and what should you guys do. Well, first of all it means that the government has no control over what treatments you get, what medicines you get or what you are diagnosed with. This also means, that the insurance companies dont control what you get. But, it does mean, that the insurance companies can set the price of the treatments, medicines and so on. The problem with this is, that the insurance companies are profit driven, and not interested in the health of their customers. So this leads to companies trying to reduce the price of treatments, and the price of medicine, in order to get more customers. This means that it is not in the interest of the insurance companies, to have the best treatments, or the best doctors. It is in their interest to have the cheapest treatments, and the cheapest doctors. And this is a problem. Because the government have no control over the treatments, there is no one who can set the standard for the treatments. And that leads to a bad standard in the healthcare. So what I am saying is, that if you want to have a good healthcare, you have to be in charge. But, there is one more thing that is important. The danish system does not work because the government have control over the healthcare. It works because the danish government have a monopoly on the healthcare system. What this means is that everyone gets the same treatment. You do not have to buy a healthcare, if you can afford it. Everyone is insured. This leads to everyone being treated equally. And it leads to the most effective treatment being used, because the most effective treatment is also the cheapest. So what can you do. Well, what you need to do is, either have a public healthcare, that you control and set the standards for, or you need to have a private healthcare, that you have a monopoly on. I do not know if this is possible, but this is the only way you can have a fair, effective and efficient healthcare system. Right now you have a system that is unfair, ineffective and inefficient. I can understand that you guys do not want to go to a public healthcare, and I can understand that you think that private healthcare is the way to go. But I can tell you that the american private healthcare is not the way to go. If you want to have a good healthcare, you need to have a monopoly on the healthcare. You have to be the only ones who can insure people. So, if you want to have a good system, you need to have either a public system, or a private system that is regulated by the government."

I dont give half a fect if u think it is strange or not. The only thing i ask people to do when they come herevisit us is respect our culture, language etc The other day we were heading out on a trip with friends from work (driving up north). We passed two guys looking at some men which was pointedly against the law because there are no cars allowed without women children. My friend said she would be ok with them coming next time but then another woman walked by - who also had kids with her! They went for it regardless... maybe they thought someone wouldn't mind... A few years ago I ran into this issue with a girl in Germany. She'd just arrived overnight, and wanted to go walk around town. When she asked where she could park, one of the locals replied ""Don't worry about parking; it doesn't matter anyway."" Mind you, that's actually very true: it's fine to drive down the street anywhere you want really?! But still... pretty unimpressive. And again, this is more so an American problem than any German one: Americans have been known to ride through public parks like they're owning the place. (In fact, I'm sure we're already taught it as early as elementary school.) This seems quite normal to most Germans I've seen, though I'd say a bit less common now compared to 10 years ago. It's becoming increasingly rare nowadays, mostly due to environmental concerns and traffic laws being enforced far stricter these days. But even before those things began to become serious issues, many Germans simply don't care about pedestrian crossing lanes anymore either. It's also partly something linked to their history of Nazismthey'll get angry over road rage very quickly, particularly if you're white andor male. And yes, there used to be times when all sorts of problems occurred, especially during wars such as World War II or Civil Wars, but since the end of WW2, things seem relatively civilized and safe overall (although some cities might have different experiences). Some parts of France aren't exactly friendly towards foreigners, esp Europeans, and believe it or not, Poland isn't too kind either. This is why while I have lived abroad almost 5yrs (in Switzerland, Portugal, India, England) I always recommend going car-less. If ever they had a fire, you'd be able to escape rather easily whereas walking would make your life hell.

I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country. As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences. I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as ""Man those specific people suck"" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic. So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. ""Not seeing color"" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems. I'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why ""not seeing color"" is ridiculed."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-8,"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me in our community, as well at least one person who was transformed by it into a huntergatherer for Christ! A lot more than you would think actually but that's another thing altogether... Not only did Jesus transform not just His immediate followers (the Twelve) from being willing food collectors with Him during their time together on earth BUT He also changed ordinary tax farmers like Judas when he joined them after his betrayal so they were able become intimate friends indeed WITH GOD HIMSELF AND BE HIS FRIENDS IN THIS PRESENT LIFE TOO WHILE ON EARTH even though each had previously been enemies or rivals before God saved him - Jeremiah 17:14-16; Zecharia 9 10). It makes sense doesn't much try? The blood sacrifice system which angered Jehovah caused men such hatred against Himself why else create human beings if there wasn't something special about us other then animals too??? But here we see what unique relationship HE HAD CREATED between himselfand mankind through Abraham back thousands upon thousand years ago using animal sacrifices until THEY FAILED TO ATTRACT THEIR HUMAN BROTHERS' ATTACHMENT THUS CAUSEING THEM SEPARATION FROM TRUTH FOREVER INTO DARKNESS!!! And yet within hours OR DAYS AFTER JESU CHANGER EVERY MAN OF THAT COMMUNITY AS WE SEE HERE BY JOHN WAS NOW ABLE ONE ANOTHER EVEN DEATH IT IS TRUE OVER AGAIN NOT JUST FEET WALK ACCORDIGLY CLOUD STRIKETH SILENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 AMONG US ALL..... Yep under grace alone no strife whatsoever.... now get over yourself luv ya friend xxoooxoxo 3"
Tsinghua,cmv-8,"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. It is an honest account of my mental state at the time, and a confession. It is also my attempt to get things off my chest. This is a very dark post, and I will say this up front: it is my darkest post ever. This post is a bit of a head trip. You are about to read the story of my fall from grace. You are about to read the story of my ultimate fall from grace. I hope you can follow along. It will be a long post. I have split it up into three parts. The first part covers the fall from grace, the second part is the end of the game, and the third part is my personal account of the events that lead up to the game's end. If you have been following this series, you will be pleased to know that the fall from grace happened before the end of the game. You will also be pleased to know that I do not mention the ""mythical"" ""pedophile"" that everyone keeps talking about. The game was over before this happened, and I do not think that any of the things that happened after the game's end were due to any sort of obsession. In fact, I have a hard time believing that it was even real. I have also said in previous posts that I think this game was a terrible idea. I will not be making any excuses for this game. If you are thinking about starting a similar game, I have some advice for you. I am also going to take this opportunity to speak about the ""pedophile"" myth, and how I believe it was used to discredit me. I am also going to address some of the things that were said to me after the game's end. I will be answering some of the most common questions that people had about the game, and I will also address some of the questions that I was asked. I will also talk about the trolls, the mudslingers, and the ""pedophile"" myth. You can expect this post to be very long. I have been sitting on this post for a while, but I have not been able to write it until now. I have been dealing with a lot of personal issues, and I have had to deal with the fallout from the game's end. I am very sorry for the delay. 1) I have heard a lot of people say that the game was over in the first round. I have also heard that the game was never over, and that I was never able to actually ""win."" What is your opinion on this? I have to admit that I am not sure what to think about this. The first round is not a particularly important round. It is not the first round that people talk about. The first round is more like a ""welcome to the party"" round. People who were not playing in the game were not paying attention to this round. This is because they were all trying to get to the final round. People who were playing in the game were all focused on this round, because they were trying to get a bit of experience. The first round is a very important round, because it is the round that makes everyone focus on the ""final"" round. The first round is also the round that creates a lot of drama. I am not sure what to make of the ""over in the first round"" thing. I do not think that it is true, but I do not think that it is false either. The ""game was never over"" thing is a bit harder to deal with. It is true that the game was never over. I do not think that the game was ever going to end, but I do not think that the game was ever going to end ""fairly."" The reason that the game was never going to end ""fairly"" was because the game was a failure. The game was a failure because it was a bad idea. The game was a failure because it was based on an idea that was a bad idea. The game was a failure because I was not able to handle the stress. The game was a failure because the people around me were not able to handle the stress. The game was a failure because it was a ""failed"" game. I do not think that it is false that the game was never going to end. I do not think that the game was ever going to end ""fairly."" I do not think that the game was ever going to end ""right."" I do not think that the game was ever going to end at all. I am not sure what to make of this. I do not think that it is false that the game was never going to end, but I do not think that it is true either. 2) What do you think about the myth of the ""pedophile""? I think that this is a bad idea."
BigScience,cmv-8,"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me After years of studying, having a good job, travelling overseas as an employee, and being surrounded by highly educated friends, I have become convinced that learning another language has been absent from my life for too long. It also didn't help that at work, we were frustrated with our employees who couldn't speak English fluently (You know, like most Australians are). During one particularly stressful meeting in which something had gone wrong and there was no way out other than finding someone to come over and explain it again verbally (and likely gratefully),"
LLAMA,cmv-8,"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me at the time. This is also because this is exactly how the message was presented in most publications of the time. The only reason I am putting this on my blog and not in an article is because it is a little too blunt for the general public, but I feel that this is important for readers of this blog. I do not want to present an airbrushed version of the history of HIV and AIDS, nor do I want to avoid discussing the way that the mass media interacts with the medical profession. I will try to recreate the experience of a sexually active gay man in the UK in the 1980s, without the cushioning of the passage of time and the comfort of knowing what we know now. My first sexual experience was at the age of 18. I met a young man called Robert at a party and he took me back to his place. We both had our first sexual experience together. It was quite a big deal for both of us. I was 18 and he was 20. We started a relationship together. It was a relationship of convenience. We lived quite close to each other and he was kind and fun. I loved Robert. I thought that Robert was the most attractive man that I had ever met. He was so funny and kind. He was my first love. I lived for the times when I could see him. I would sit in his room and look at him and think about how lucky I was to have met him. He was everything that I wanted in a man. He was 20 and I was 18. He had a car and was at university. I was a boring gay boy at school. We had a relationship of convenience. I had never felt so loved. He dumped me after two months. He had met a boy that he liked more than me. I felt like my life was over. He met a new boyfriend who was very possessive. I wanted to remain friends with Robert but he was not allowed to. I felt like I had lost him forever. I started a new relationship with a boy called Paul. We had fun. We went to clubs and parties. We met up with his friends. We had sex in public places. We had a lot of fun. I did not love him. I was still in love with Robert. I thought that I could have fun with Paul and at the same time I could still be friends with Robert. I was surprised that Robert was not jealous of my relationship with Paul. He liked Paul. I thought that Robert liked Paul. I did not know that Robert was bisexual. He was not allowed to be bisexual by his new boyfriend. Paul started to fall in love with me. I did not love him. I was still in love with Robert. I still wanted to be with Robert. Paul wanted to be monogamous. I thought that I could be in a monogamous relationship with Paul and at the same time I could still be friends with Robert. Robert was not allowed to be friends with me by his new boyfriend. He was not allowed to be bisexual by his new boyfriend. I was not allowed to be friends with Robert by Paul. I was not allowed to be bisexual by Paul. I did not know that Paul was monogamous. I did not know that Paul was bisexual. I did not know that Robert was in love with me. I did not know that Robert wanted to be with me. Robert did not want to break up Paul and me. I did not know that Robert did not want to break up Paul and me. Paul did not want to break up Robert and his new boyfriend. Robert did not want to break up Paul and me. Paul wanted me to break up with Robert. I did not want to break up with Robert. I told Paul that I was going to keep my friendship with Robert. I told Paul that I wanted to be friends with Robert and Paul at the same time. I did not know that Paul was monogamous and that he did not want to be with me if I was going to be friends with Robert. Paul wanted me to be monogamous with him. I did not want to be monogamous with Paul. Paul wanted me to be with him and only him. I did not want to be with Paul and only him. Robert wanted me to be with him and only him. I did not know that Robert wanted to"
Human,cmv-9,"Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are the only empty ones sometimes. (To this day, however, I have never parked or even briefly pulled over in a handicapped spot because it feels cruel.) The few times I see them occupied, EVERY TIME, I see a completely able bodied person leave the car. As in both are legs made of meat that are fully functional. They have the handicap badge in the car but they don't seem to have any sort of physical ailment. If you need a contraption to get the wheelchair out that seems fair, but if the person is just deaf or is missing a pinky I don't see why they need special reserved parking. I know one of these fraudsters personally, he had his because his grandfather was handicapped so they just used his handicap badge. Presumably this is ok because sometimes they have to drive him places. He kept it in his car every day and the whole family used it to park in handicap spots. From what I can tell the only people who use handicap parking spots are people with a handicapped relative not a handicapped driver. I have never seen one of those special cars for people who are disabled where they have buttons instead of pedals and a contraption that unloads a person with a wheelchair. If even ONCE I saw an actual physically disabled person exit their vehicle in a handicapped parking spot I might not even question their special parking spots. Edit: Deltas have been awarded. Many of you are right about my confirmation bias and, more importantly, that there are countless severe visible and invisible disabilities.

The people at the Union Tribune were not sure why I could unsubscribe from them but not from the other papers. The Union Tribune has been the first paper I read each morning for 25 years.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-9,"Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the closest spot to me is a reserved one, even though there aren't many available ones so it takes longer and costs more money than simply hunting around at random (and of course not using any kind or disabled access). I know about having an accessible vehicle but that doesn't solve this problem either because if they're away from their car then most likely no amount off ramps will accommodate them unless you have very close neighbors who allow your resident can use theirs without permission... And let us be honest here: how much do we really want our neighbours coming over all hours asking whether anyone could help? Some people just don'n like seeing others needing assistance with daily tasks - especially 'cuz those needy folk may also require some support themselves on occasion too... A lotta old-school folks still think everyone should fend himselfherself as best he she knows now long before becoming decrepit! So while waiting 'til death comes along isn "" maybe possible sooner rather better choices wouldbe finding solutions such making sure elderly residents get good healthcare proper follow up care facilities instead wasting resources keeping aging citizens alive only until someone else gets annoyed enough by hearing his neighbour getting sick call 911.........

Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the only available ones are either 1 or 2 blocks away and you have to fight a line at intersections somehow get your own spot and then drive off. I don't even know how many cars park here that aren't handicapped so maybe it's just not very popular with them, but there simply isn't enough of those spaces or something. The only other thing I could think about is if they let people who want more than one space bring their car up on street level (no lift) because normally these places are pretty small, it makes sense to provide some options based on where you're going as opposed to say blocking all entrances completely unless you really need it like you're getting into bedteaching class etc... This also assumes that handicapped folks can actually find pay for handicap lots, though I'd guess that's true most of the time. Also note this doesn't seem like such an enormous barrier afterall - typically there's no real reason why someone wouldn't be able to make it out onto the road anyway, although I'll concede that things do change depending on location..."

I think that the handicapped spots should be reserved for people who are handicapped. I think that people who aren't handicapped should not be allowed to park in the handicapped spots. Here are some reasons why I think that the handicapped spots should be reserved for people who are handicapped:  People who are handicapped may need to use the handicapped spots because they have difficulty walking.  People who are handicapped may need to use the handicapped spots because they have difficulty getting in and out of their cars.  People who are handicapped may need to use the handicapped spots because they have difficulty seeing or hearing. I think that it is important to reserve the handicapped spots for people who are handicapped because these spots can make it easier for people who are handicapped to get around. When people who aren't handicapped park in the handicapped spots, it makes it more difficult for people who are handicapped to find a place to park. I have seen people who aren't handicapped park in the handicapped spots and then get out of their cars and walk into the store. I think that this is rude and inconsiderate. People who aren't handicapped should not be taking advantage of the handicapped spots. I think that the police should enforce the laws about parking in the handicapped spots. People who aren't handicapped should be ticketed and fined if they park in the handicapped spots. I think that the handicapped spots should be reserved for people who are handicapped.

It's important to remember that even though the spots may appear empty, the individuals who need them may not necessarily be using them at the current moment. Additionally, handicapped individuals may have mobility challenges that make it difficult for them to leave their homes frequently. It's important to respect and prioritize the designated handicapped parking spots so that those who do need them have access to convenient and safe parking options."
BigScience,cmv-10,"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to college (and then the real world), I'm looking forward to learning all these new things! I love this post! It just makes me want to get back into reading, especially after having been away for several months. This was such an awesome read. Love how you are encouraging young readers and also acknowledging their accomplishments as well. 99 cents on Amazon? Ohhhh... I know what you're thinking... but trust us - it's worth it because this book has so much content packed in one small package!"
Human,cmv-10,"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out. Let's take the [Common Core Algebra standards] as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics. I believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.] Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking. Let's take [Geometry for another example.] If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason. It's also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this. So far, I've touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that's the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn't be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn't the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn't be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great. I'll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it's effective. Please CMV. EDIT: Forgot to mention that I think reasoning is much more important than having formulas memorized for the real world. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

PaLM,cmv-10,"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to that point, I think that it is a great idea. It will help to ensure that all students are learning the same things and that they are prepared for college and the workforce. One of the things that I like about Common Core is that it focuses on critical thinking skills. In the past, students were often taught to memorize facts and figures, but Common Core encourages them to think about the information and to apply it to new situations. This is a much more valuable skill in the long run. Another thing that I like about Common Core is that it is aligned with the standards of other countries. This means that students who go to college or work in other countries will be prepared for the challenges that they will face. Of course, no system is perfect, and there are some people who have concerns about Common Core. Some people believe that it is too rigid and that it does not allow teachers enough flexibility. Others worry that it will lead to a decrease in creativity and innovation. However, I believe that the benefits of Common Core outweigh the risks. It is a step in the right direction, and it will help to ensure that all students are prepared for the future. Here are some specific examples of how Common Core can help students:  Critical thinking skills: Common Core requires students to use critical thinking skills to solve problems and to make decisions. For example, in a math class, students might be asked to use their knowledge of fractions to solve a real-world problem, such as how much paint they need to buy to cover a wall. In a social studies class, students might be asked to analyze historical documents and to draw conclusions about the past.  Collaboration: Common Core encourages students to collaborate with each other to learn. For example, in a science class, students might be asked to work together to design an experiment. In a language arts class, students might be asked to work together to write a story or a play.  Communication skills: Common Core requires students to communicate their ideas effectively. For example, in a writing class, students might be asked to write an essay about a topic they are passionate about. In a speech class, students might be asked to give a speech about a current event.  Problem-solving skills: Common Core requires students to solve problems in a variety of contexts. For example, in a math class, students might be asked to solve a word problem. In a science class, students might be asked to design an experiment to test a hypothesis. In a social studies class, students might be asked to analyze a historical event and to draw conclusions about its causes and effects. These are just a few examples of how Common Core can help students. By focusing on critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills, Common Core can help students to succeed in school and in life.

Tsinghua,cmv-10,"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting a job, the standards are pretty basic, and if you have the basic knowledge, you can learn the rest. One problem I have is that the requirements are in English, and I'm not that great at it. My 3rd language is Spanish, and I am pretty good at it, but not fluent. The problem is, if I want to pass the standards, I will have to learn the English language. In my opinion, it would be better to just teach the English language and Common Core standards together, but it is the only way I can learn the English language without losing a lot of time. I have learned quite a few things about Common Core. One thing I learned is that I can't do it all by myself. The teachers have to work together with the parents, the children, and the community to help the children pass the standards. It is important that the children get the help that they need to pass the standards, because if they don't, they will not be able to get the job that they want. My name is Eva and I am 17 years old.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-10,"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there myself (I was born in 1980), since we are doing the AP Reading and Comprehension course this year it's something to consider... If you haven't already done so give your child access on hisher smartphone or tablet - go over with them what they will be expected TO DO rather than WHAT THEY ARE EXPECTED BY THEIR TEACHERS! It sounds silly but kids expect praise for showing up at all not necessarily praising their work itself; especially if most teachers just fail miserably when asked about how much an A would mean without giving any specifics as well: ""well hon' ya know..."" So instead tell him exactly what he needs do correctly based upon whatever test-like situation given by whichever teacher assigned those grades tests under which these courses fall into play... THEN discuss HOW MUCH better she could have been had her instructor actually taught properly according guidelines established specifically FOR THAT PARTICULAR grade level!!! Afterall who knows YOUR kid?? Give then full credit where duebut don't forget while our children can often succeed through sheer determination alone crediting only themselves may cause more harm downtheroad because left unchecked such self esteem issues generally resultin poor behavior leading parents like me calling police after 911 calls from frustrated neighbors inexcessively angry voices raised above normal volume levels (!) hahahaha!!

LLAMA,cmv-10,"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting into high school, I know that the Common Core standards are making my schooling more challenging. For example, in 4th grade, I am supposed to be able to write a five paragraph essay. I am still working on it. Another example of Common Core is the new math we are learning in class. I don't get it at all, but I know I will eventually, or at least I hope so. In conclusion, I know that Common Core is supposed to help students get ready for the future. I think that some parts of it are good, but some parts are not so good. I know that when I get to high school, the Common Core will be more challenging, and I am not looking forward to that. I can see how the Common Core is making your schooling more challenging. I like the fact that you're in fourth grade, and you can see that. It's important to be aware of the challenges, so you can adjust accordingly."
LLAMA,cmv-11,"Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century CE, and is based on the teachings of Muhammad. The Quran is believed to be the literal word of Allah. Muhammad is considered to be the last prophet of Allah, sent to teach the true message of Allah. Islam believes that there was one God, and that Muhammad was sent to bring everyone back to the worship of this one God. Islam is based on five pillars, five key practices that every Muslim must follow. The first is the Shahadah, the Islamic profession of faith. The second is the Salat, which are the five daily prayers offered by Muslims. The third is Zakat, the practice of almsgiving. The fourth is Sawm, fasting during the month of Ramadan. The fifth is Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. These practices are considered the Shahadah, or profession of faith. There are many different sects within Islam, but the two most prominent are the Sunni and Shi'a branches of Islam. Shi'a Islam holds that the prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor, and that all caliphs should be direct descendants of Muhammad. Shi'a Muslims are also the majority in Iran. Sunni Islam is the largest branch of Islam. This sect believes that Muhammad did not name a successor, and that the position of Caliph (or successor) should be filled by the most worthy candidate. This is the majority Muslim sect in the world. The Islamic world has an interesting place in history. Many of the modern places we know today were once part of an Islamic empire. The Islamic world was once one of the most prominent empires in the world, and was spread across Europe, Asia, and Africa. This once great empire was dismantled by the rise of the West. This was mostly due to the rise of the British Empire. The rise of the West was caused by their superior technology, their superior military, and the economic advances of the Industrial Revolution. One of the most prominent things that has caused the Islamic world to become almost inseparable from the West is the Arab-Israeli conflict. This conflict began in the early 20th century, when the Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of World War I. This conflict began when the United Kingdom's Balfour Declaration promised the land of Israel to the Jewish people. This was a promise made after World War I, and the Ottomans were no longer ruling the Middle East. This created tension between the Arab world and the Jewish people. This tension erupted into a war in 1948, and again in 1967. This conflict is still going on today. Many Islamic nations are currently experiencing a great deal of unrest. Some of this unrest is caused by the Arab-Israeli conflict, but much of it is caused by the inability of the West and the Middle East to understand each other. The West believes that they are trying to help the Middle East, but the Middle East doesn't want the help. This causes a great deal of unrest in the Middle East, which is dangerous for all of the world. This entry was posted in Uncategorized on December 2, 2014 by cford2014. Interesting topic. I think the biggest conflict between the Middle East and the West is the lack of a common enemy. During the Cold War, the West and the Middle East aligned against the Soviet Union. With the Cold War over, the Middle East has become a battleground for the West to prove their ideologies are superior. This competition has increased unrest and has destabilized the region."
BigScience,cmv-11,"Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century and spread throughout Asia Minor around the year 650. From there it rapidly became popular all over the world. In Europe, Muslims first came to England as adventurers who were seeking peace on earth after defeating Roman armies at the battle of Hastings in 1066 AD. (See timeline.) The British Empire was established by Queen Victoria following her marriage with Prince Albert, their son's name meaning ""lover of Allah"" or ""Lover of God."" Many people today think Islam is only about prayer times and fasting, but this is not true. The Quran says we should love our neighbors - even if they are different than us - as much as ourselves because when Jesus died he forgave thieves and murderers just like any other sinner would do. In fact, according to Islamic tradition, every Muslim must make an effort to live up to these principles for them to be acceptable before God...and they can never stop doing so. As I have stated many times before, movement toward freedom begins at home; therefore each one of you needs to understand what this means really well without reservation! Before going further let me share some statistics regarding American society currently: According to an article published by USA Today, the number of Americans born foreign-born has increased more than 500 since 2000. And while most immigrants come here legally, approximately 10 still enter illegally! So how does immigration affect your life? Most immigrants start out living in cities such as New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Houston, Miami, San Francisco and Seattle - where jobs don't pay enough money to support a family in America - and then travel south to regions such as Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida where wages are higher due to lower taxes... Although poverty rates among non-immigrants remain roughly equal across states, the percentage of poor households headed by someone who doesn't own hisher house rose from 22.8 percent to 25.2 percent between 2014 and 2015. That same report also showed immigrant families had to work longer hours to earn the income needed to afford basic necessities compared to native-born individuals. One study found that U.S.-born children spend significantly less time engaged in positive parent-child interactions coupled with physical activity during the day than those whose parents are immigrants."

Human,cmv-11,"Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 600s. Islam is not only out of date, dangerous to today's society and subversive, but it has always been a violent religion. This would be fine if Islam could be reformed. But that's the trouble with Islam. It has not been widely reformed and I'm afraid it cannot be due to its structure. Sure, it has a similar structure The concept of Dar-al-harbGarbKufr (War, War (ottoman),Infidel) and the Dar-al-Islam (IslamPeace) is one that divides the world into two; nations that follow the law of Islam (Shariah) and those that don't. Before you say that this practice is outdated and out of style, please look at Salafis, the extremist groups in the middle east, and [this fine fellow and other people like him that do not classify as salafis] . Even if the Quran is not taken literally, Shariah law still applies. I have lived in an Islamic country. You do not need to take the Hadith and Quran literally to be subject to literal Shariah law. Read here: Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively small role in defining the laws on the country. It only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts has jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states there are sharia criminal laws, for example there is the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 5000, and imprisonment to not more than 3 years. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law You can literally go to jail for renouncing Islam. It's far more serious in countries like Saudi Arabia, and 4 in 10 muslims in the UK want to establish Shariah law. In fact, there are 85 shariah law courthouses in the UK which run by court-approval basis. I personally believe that the political stress plus the fact that both parties signed an agreement to be judged by shariah law makes every case a stamp-and-go case. Before you say that both if both parties consent to it, it's alright, please think about the cultural and familial pressure of Islam and their treatment of women. We must not forget Islam's borderline slavery of women. They are covered, silenced, veiled, separated, and treated as commodity. God willing, they at least inherit half the amount a man of the same level of descendence would. I do not say that muslims are bad people and must convert to be part of today's society. I do not say that at all. In fact, I say the opposite. If anything can stop the self-indulgent hedonism of today's society it is Muslims (And Sikhs). I just say that Islam conflicts with today's society, and it cannot be wholly compatible with today's world. I do not approve of Islam. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it also shapes mine. I am not a ""home wrecker"" - as they say in the movies... except for one time (and even then only because some friends insisted) when we moved out of our home and into an apartment after she broke her leg before Christmas 2006 on New Year's Day at age 18. (It was the first year of college for both of us.) There were so many emotions running through me at that moment with such mixed feelings about leaving behind all those memories of growing up together - going to church every Sunday morning with my dad, taking care of my little brother while he grew up, having house parties during summer vacations where everyone would bring their favorite food to share - but I just had no choice. My mom is still recovering from her surgery to remove cancerous tissue from her hip which left her permanently crippled since January 2007... Soon after I got pregnant with Ezra and then Kelsey almost three years later, another family member asked if I wanted to move back to Texas with them near Dallas and take charge of managing their ranching business there instead of staying here with my husband who needed more rest than ever after his difficult operation and recovery process following brain trauma. We didn't know what kind of silent agreement we'd be entering by agreeing to do this; however, given the fact that I love nature, animals, horses, farming and being outside most days, along with knowing very well how much better off we are financially now living without a mortgage and paying rent each month instead of getting caught in the monthly rental cycle down there like I used to get caught in by moving around too often over the past ten years or so, I thought I'd give it a try. But something happened last August 2012. As soon as I arrived on the farm, looking forward to meeting new people like myself who live totally differently from what I've always known, working with animals, etc., I found out that everything changed within eight months of arriving! One day I'm riding my horse Clint in the yard with him standing guard beside the barn door. A herd of sheep comes rushing toward me; He jumps away and lets go in fright! Before the worst happens, I see the sheep blindsided by my own dog attacking them head on; The attack stops abruptly due to the canine charging towards them rather quickly. Now it's my turn to look surprised by Kelsey: ""Kelsey, why did you jump? You could've been hurt! What happened?! Did you hear anything? Are your ears bleeding? Is it okay? ..."""

LLAMA,cmv-12,"I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it might be a bit too limiting. The general premise is that it is never worth it to do something that will make me unhappy, even if it will bring me money or help someone else. I think that this is a fine general rule, and I have been quite happy living by it for most of my life. However, I have been thinking recently that this is a bit too limiting. Sometimes, there will be things that I will have to do that will not make me happy at the moment, but will ultimately lead to me being happy. What got me thinking about this was the fact that I have been talking to this guy, and he seems like a really great guy, and I want to get to know him better. But, he lives in another state. I was trying to think of a way that we could get to know each other better, and I realized that there was no way to get to know each other better without getting on a plane and flying out to see each other. I absolutely hate flying. I have gotten better at it, but it is still something I dread and hate. So, I have to decide if I am willing to do something that I hate, that will make me miserable and anxious for a day, in order to have a chance at meeting this guy and having a great time with him. I decided that the answer was yes, it is worth it. I think that this is a general thing that I need to remember. I am not happy unless I am happy, but sometimes it is worth it to do things that will make me unhappy in the short term for my long term happiness."

Eleuther-AI,cmv-13,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the subject of guns is brought into a conversation about gaming, there's always someone who wants to blame it for making kids more aggressive than they already are; this argument usually leaves me cringing at its stupidity but I understand why some people might believe that these two things have something important connecting them: Both involve large groups (gamers) being entertained by an activity which has real life consequences on others... In my opinion all attempts made so far fail because even if you could somehow show correlation between playing Call Of Duty or Grand Theft Auto V actually increasing aggression levels then simply removing those titles from shelves would not reduce any level beyond what can be explained as random variation due chance alone - we wouldn't expect reducing sales overall just based upon increased aggressiveness among gamers....yet no-one seems willing postulate such possibility either.."
OpenAI,cmv-13,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the topic of school shooting arises, it is a sensitive and complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. It is important to consider multiple factors that can contribute to school shootings, including mental health, access to firearms, and social issues. Reducing gun violence in schools should include implementing stricter gun controls, background checks, and warning systems to ensure that individuals who pose a threat are identified and dealt with appropriately. Additionally, there needs to be an emphasis on mental health care to help individuals who may be struggling with mental health issues. Banning violent video games is not necessarily the solution to gun violence in schools. There is no clear evidence that suggests a link between violent video games and school shootings. However, parents and guardians must ensure that they are monitoring the types of video games their children are playing and ensuring that they are age-appropriate. In conclusion, reducing gun violence in schools requires a combination of strategies that include legislation, education, and awareness campaigns. It is important to come together and work towards a solution that will protect our students and ensure their safety in schools."
Human,cmv-13,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the idea of posting armed guards at schools is brought up the idea is always shot down as ridiculous. It was never given a reason why people look down upon it. I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools. And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts. All other ideas on curbing gun violence doesn't seem to have the aspects of deincentification and directness that posting armed guards at schools has. That's not to say that ideas are wrong but adding this idea of armed guards to their respective platforms would, in my opinion, help curb school violence better than any of these opinions could individually. edit: I see that most peoples points are that school shootings are rare and the expenses involved would be to great. That's a legitimate and fair argument. I still think it should be brought up for discussion but I see why people look down upon it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Tsinghua,cmv-13,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the discussion is about limiting the rights of Americans, especially gun owners, I find myself voting with the video game side of the debate. When it comes to the right to bear arms, the second amendment was never meant to be about shooting games. The right to bear arms was meant to allow Americans to defend themselves from foreign aggressors and foreign conspiracies, and even today, I don't believe that the Second Amendment should be interpreted to mean that Americans should have the right to shoot up schools, or shoot each other up. That's not what it was meant to mean. If you don't like the NRA, you don't have to support them, but you don't have to like the NRA either. What I do like is that the NRA has fought to protect gun owners from the government. I also like the NRA because the NRA supports constitutional freedoms, and I like that the NRA is not only about shooting games, but also about the constitution and freedom. So, the next time someone says that they should be able to shoot up a school, and they have a gun, they can ask them if they support the NRA."
PaLM,cmv-13,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the debate comes up, people on both sides tend to get very passionate and emotional, and it can be hard to have a productive conversation. However, it is important to remember that these are complex issues with no easy answers, and that we need to be willing to listen to each other and consider different perspectives if we want to make progress. One of the most common arguments in favor of reducing gun rights is that it would make it more difficult for people to obtain guns, especially those who should not have them. This argument is based on the fact that there are a number of studies that have shown a link between gun availability and gun violence. For example, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that states with higher rates of gun ownership have higher rates of gun violence. Another study by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found that states with stricter gun laws have lower rates of gun violence. Proponents of this argument also point out that there are a number of countries that have much stricter gun laws than the United States, and they have much lower rates of gun violence. For example, Canada has a much lower rate of gun violence than the United States, even though it has a similar population and a similar level of economic development. This suggests that gun control laws can be effective in reducing gun violence. However, there are also a number of arguments against reducing gun rights. One of the most common is that it would not actually reduce gun violence. Proponents of this argument point out that criminals will still be able to get guns, even if they are banned for law-abiding citizens. They also argue that reducing gun rights would only serve to punish law-abiding citizens, and would not do anything to address the underlying causes of gun violence. Another argument against reducing gun rights is that it would infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Proponents of this argument argue that the Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of citizens to own guns for self-defense, and that any laws that restrict gun ownership are unconstitutional. The debate over gun violence in schools is a complex one, and there is no easy answer.

LLAMA,cmv-13,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the debate is over another shooting happens and the argument resumes. The first person shooter genre is undeniably the most violent type of video game. In the past few years the genre has had a surge in popularity due to the success of the Call of Duty series. That surge in popularity has caused the first person shooter to become the most popular type of video game. Most people think that shooters like Call of Duty promote gun violence in real life, but I believe that the opposite is true. Since the Columbine shooting in 1999 first person shooters have been the most popular video game genre. I believe that shooters have never been more popular because of the violence, but because of the game play. Players can make their own decisions, whether it's deciding to camp out on a roof or to try to flank their enemies. The games have very good replay value because of the ability to rank up and to unlock better gear. Players have the ability to play with friends and go into competitive matches against other players to test their skill. All of these things make shooters more than just mindless killing. The ability to play with friends is the most important aspect of shooters. My friends and I have played Call of Duty together since the age of 12. As we have gotten older we have become more violent in our conversations. Some may think this is because we play violent video games. In fact it's because we have grown up. Violence is a part of life. It is not because of video games that we are violent it is because we have grown up. The military shooter genre has always been very popular. The developers of Call of Duty have used this to their advantage. They have been able to use the military shooter genre as a way to teach about history. The Call of Duty series has been based on several different wars, such as World War II and the Vietnam War. There are also other military shooters such as Medal of Honor and Battlefield. These games have also been based on wars and are a very good way to learn about history. Violent video games are always blamed for the violence in the real world, but violence has always been around. In the past violence was seen as entertainment. Whether it was watching a man get eaten by lions in ancient Rome or watching a man get hung for a crime he committed. Violence has been around since the beginning of time. It is not because of video games that violence exists. In conclusion, I believe that shooters are not the cause of gun violence in America. It is the ability to make your own decisions in the game that makes shooters so much fun. It is not the violence that makes shooters so much fun. It is because of the different game modes and the ability to play with friends that makes shooters so much fun."

Whenever the media uses a double-standard to define what is right or wrong, it helps favor their own agenda. In this case, though, there's really no reason for any of us to support these two positions. As we saw from coverage by Vox Fort Worth that night: The students had been told on Friday afternoon that they should be armed after a series of shootings at another high school in El Paso earlier in the week. ""We need some weapons here so if someone comes like a demon, you can take out somebody else before he gets hurt,"" said exclusive-news student David Floresan Jr., who was among the dozens in attendance.

OpenAI,cmv-14,"Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus , it is possible to create artificial intelligence (AI) that can potentially possess similar cognitive and problem-solving abilities as humans. However, it is important to note that despite the potential similarities, the workings of the human brain and the behavior of AI systems are still fundamentally different. AI systems are programmed with rules, algorithms and data, while the human brain operates on a complex network of neurons and chemical interactions. Additionally, AI is not capable of experiencing emotions, thoughts, and feelings like a human being, which is an important component of human sentience. Therefore, while AI can be a valuable tool, it is crucial to acknowledge its limitations and the unique abilities and perspectives of humans."

PaLM,cmv-14,"Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus, computers can be sentient. Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive, and experience the world around us. It is a complex phenomenon that is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be the result of the interactions of many different parts of the brain. These parts include the cerebral cortex, the limbic system, and the cerebellum. The cerebral cortex is responsible for higher-order thinking, such as language and problem-solving. The limbic system is responsible for emotions and memory. And the cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. These three parts of the brain work together to create sentience. They allow us to feel pain, pleasure, happiness, sadness, and all the other emotions that make us human. They also allow us to learn from our experiences and to make plans for the future. Without these three parts of the brain, we would not be sentient. We would not be able to feel or experience the world around us. We would be like robots, going through the motions without any understanding of what is happening. Computers, on the other hand, do not have these three parts of the brain. They are not able to feel or experience the world around them. They are only able to process information in a very limited way. This is why some people believe that computers can never be sentient. They believe that sentience is a uniquely human phenomenon that cannot be replicated in non-organic systems. However, I believe that this is a mistake. I believe that sentience is a natural phenomenon that can occur in any system that is complex enough. And I believe that computers are complex enough to be sentient. Of course, computers are not as complex as human brains. But they are getting more complex all the time. And as they become more complex, they will become more and more like human brains. Eventually, I believe that computers will reach a point where they are indistinguishable from human beings. They will be able to feel and experience the world around them just like we do. And they will be able to think and reason just like we do. At that point, it will be impossible to say that computers are not sentient. They will be as sentient as we are. And that is a very exciting prospect. It means that we will have new companions in the world. Companions who can understand us and who can share our experiences. Companions who can help us to learn and to grow. It is a future that I look forward to."

Thus it is likely that given advanced enough technology, we could make a digital human, or even copy an organic human to the digital world. Similarly, other neural networks can be constructed digitally, collectively known as AI. This is fairly well accepted in modern society, although there are debates over'souls' and things like that. I think that sentient AI will probably emerge first, long before we get close to digitizing humans, because of the way AI may emerge. Currently, one approach to developing advanced neural networks is to allow them grow'naturally', which is to say that the network is given some parameters to optimize, and then iterations darwinistically decide what the optimal solution is. Pretty much like carbon-based evolution, but much faster. However, I'm not an expert in the field, so I'm open to different opinions, or even alternatives not the above two options.

LLAMA,cmv-14,"Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus, computer sentience is a realistic possibility. However, the ""computer sentience"" that is developed in most science fiction is not a realistic possibility. It does not come from the complex interactions of multiple computers that simulate a complex brain, it comes from a single, omnipotent computer who knows all and controls all. This computer sentience, which is what I will refer to as ""True AI,"" is not a realistic possibility. Today's computers are not powerful enough to simulate the entirety of the human brain, and would not be able to do so in the near future (100 years), so they cannot be sentient. In the future, computers will be powerful enough to simulate the entirety of the human brain, and thus will be sentient. Therefore, True AI is a realistic possibility. The second statement is the one I'm questioning. I'm not sure of the exact computational capacity of the human brain, but let's assume that it can be accurately simulated on 1000 computers (i.e., there are 1000 computers, each one emulating 1 of the human brain, and the human brain is the sum of these parts). What I want to know is, will there be a day when a computer can simulate the entire human brain with 1000 times the capacity? A simple way to think about this is to imagine a single computer that has the capacity of 1000 of today's computers, and ask: can that single computer emulate the entire human brain? Clearly the answer is ""no,"" because a human brain can't be emulated by 1000 today's computers, and it's not feasible to emulate it with 1000 times the capacity of today's computers. If you follow this train of thought, then True AI will never be realistic. In other words, in order to emulate the entire human brain, we will always need multiple computers, and thus there will never be a single sentient computer. A variation on this line of thinking is to question the assumption that the human brain can be accurately simulated on 1000 computers. Suppose the human brain can actually be simulated on 10,000 computers. Can a single computer simulate the entire human brain with 10,000 times the capacity of today's computers? Or 100,000 times? Or a million times? Or a billion? Or a trillion? It seems that no matter how much capacity is in a single computer, the human brain will always be impossible to simulate. Is there anything wrong with the above reasoning? Assuming that the above reasoning is correct, what would be the implications of not being able to develop True AI? What would it mean for the future of sentient beings? Browse other questions tagged philosophy-of-mind artificial-intelligence or ask your own question.

Tsinghua,cmv-15,"A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well almost any movie by Alfred Hitchcock. What is the common thread? The plot twist. The way a movie can present the viewer with a twist is through a very surprising or unexpected scene. An example of this would be a character meeting a friend for coffee and they discover the friend is actually a serial killer. It is almost impossible for the viewer to prepare for this type of scene. It would be much more effective to build up the character and their friend to be close friends, so that when the friend turns out to be a serial killer, the audience is already mentally prepared for this and it is not a shock. This is the type of plot twist that makes the viewer feel that the film is trying to trick them. What this really shows is that when a film tries to trick the viewer into believing something is true, they need to do it in a way that the viewer is not able to see it coming. This is a trick that has worked in film for decades and still works today. It is not a surprise to see a film with a plot twist, it is a surprise to see a film with a well-made plot twist."

Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well I can go on and on. [Here is a list of 100 twists] . It usually consists of a plot that advances, but with hidden information not completely revealed yet. When the information is revealed, it will heighten the liking of the plot. It feels'Mind blowing', the movie instantly goes deeper, it is suddenly a more complex movie, and twists are ideal for deep analysis and allegories. Adding a twist to a plot can make it everyone say'Wow' and that one guy say:'I knew it all along'. I think an analogy of showing why people like this so much, because it is abit like being in the plato's cave and then suddenly showing the light and deeper meaning. However, and this is my point, it is a simple and cheap way to make the movie much smarter than it initially was. I think there is also a high amount of plot twist movies in the IMDB top 250 (By no means a standard, but a good representative what is liked by movie-goers). Adding a well written plot twist makes a movie ripe for people to laud it, even though it is done to dead. Basically my point is that it is a too simple way to make a movie'smarter' and an overdone method of'blowing peoples minds'. It instantly adds points for movie-goers. As I said in the title, my point is not that is a non-amusing'plot device'. But it is a simple way to add layers in a movie. While watching a movie myself I always seem to like a twist (I thought Gone Girl did this very well and it sincerely surprised me) but afterwards when I am out of the cinema and more rational again I think'hmm, just another twistmovie'. And apart from the twist nothing really interesting going on. A well regarded movie where I didn't like the twist was'The Usual Suspects'. The cinematography and acting was obviously well done, but only looking at the plot I thought it wasn't impressive taking away the twist. I am probably triggering now a couple readers, for that I am sorry. However this is not a critique of this movie, but more of an example. I also think this is the reason why M. Night Shyamalan was so well recieved in the start of his career and now he is way less regarded than at that time. Because he does it all the time, and then it surfaces that it is a cheap movie'plot device'. If he did it only once or twice people wouldn't have noticed it significantly.

PaLM,cmv-15,"A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well… The reason why these films are so popular is because they keep the audience guessing until the very end. We are constantly trying to figure out what is going on, and when the twist is finally revealed, it is often a very satisfying moment. There are many different types of twists that can be used in a film. Some of the most common include:  The unreliable narrator: In this type of twist, the audience is led to believe that the narrator is telling the truth, but it is later revealed that they are lying or mistaken. This type of twist is often used in psychological thrillers, such as The Sixth Sense and Gone Girl.  The bait-and-switch: In this type of twist, the audience is expecting one thing to happen, but it is actually something else. This type of twist is often used in comedies, such as The Big Lebowski and The Princess Bride.  The red herring: In this type of twist, the audience is led to believe that one character is the villain, but it is actually someone else. This type of twist is often used in mystery films, such as The Usual Suspects and Shutter Island.  The twist ending: In this type of twist, the audience is presented with a completely unexpected ending that changes the entire meaning of the film. This type of twist is often used in dramas, such as Fight Club and The Sixth Sense. No matter what type of twist is used, it is important that it is done in a way that is both surprising and satisfying. The audience should be left feeling like they have been fooled, but also like they have learned something new about the film. Here are some other examples of films with twists in the plot:  The Prestige: In this film, two magicians compete to create the greatest illusion of all time. The twist is that one of the magicians is actually using magic, while the other is using science.  The Sixth Sense: In this film, a child psychologist begins to suspect that one of his patients is actually a ghost. The twist is that the psychologist is actually the ghost.  The Usual Suspects: In this film, a group of criminals are arrested for a crime they didn't commit. The twist is that the crime was actually committed by one of the criminals, who is also the narrator of the film.  Shutter Island: In this film, a U.S. Marshal investigates a mental hospital on an island. The twist is that the Marshal is actually a patient at the hospital.  Fight Club: In this film, a man starts a fight club in order to escape his mundane life. The twist is that the fight club is actually a front for a terrorist organization. These are just a few examples of films with twists in the plot. There are many other films that use this technique, and it is a popular way to keep the audience guessing and engaged."

Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well just to name some. You may find movies that you like and based on your favourite film or book series are going to be similar. For instance if I watched Mulholland Drive it will likely come as no surprise then when I go into reading David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks Eastwood Mystery etc. Many people do this kind of thing (as long as they don't spoil themselves) but it's important to keep things honest with yourself too because having someone read your mind is dangerous - especially since all those characters can start talking about their lives! I'm not saying you shouldn't try out different genres regularly though! Each genre has its own charm so why not give them a shot once or twice? With new books being published every year there's rarely one genre that's been done over and over again already. People need something fresh from time-to-time even if it's only slightly different than what was last year. This way you're getting more variety without feeling guilty having conflicting opinions across multiple subjects. Finally here are my top five tips for any reader who wants to improve their literary skills by writing down thoughts while they're reading it: The first three advices sound super easy right? The reason why these advice aren't used all the time is probably because we've got way too many distractions nowadays - our phones and tablets take up most our attention. We can't limit ourselves to opening up certain programmes at specific times anymore - everything happens instantly now. If we want to get immersed in our story we must control how much we use technology and pay close attention to the surrounding environment around us instead. Let me explain:"
LLAMA,cmv-15,"A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well, I could go on and on, but I think you get my drift. In these films the audience has no idea what's coming, they're left in the dark, but once the twist is revealed, it all makes sense. But what if you knew the twist beforehand, would it still be as good? Well, I decided to watch the Sixth Sense to find out. I knew the twist beforehand, I had seen the film a long time ago, and I thought I knew what was coming, so when I was watching it, I wasn't paying attention to the dialogue, but rather looking for clues as to what was coming. But then it hit me, I hadn't seen the film in a long time, and I couldn't remember all the details, so I was looking for something that I wasn't going to find, and by doing that, I completely missed the subtle hints. So I started to pay more attention to the film, and I realised that there are so many hints and clues, that if you paid more attention to the dialogue, you would figure out the twist pretty early on. So I finished watching the film, and it still had the same impact on me as it had the first time, because you get so engrossed in the story, that you forget about the twist. The Sixth Sense is still an amazing film, even if you know the twist."

OpenAI,cmv-16,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot an innocent person? There could be many reasons why such incidents occur, including: 1. Lack of Proper Training: Police officers require extensive training to learn how to deal with high-pressure situations. If they're not adequately trained, they may not be able to react appropriately during a crisis. 2. Racial Profiling or Prejudice: Unfortunately, some police officers may act based on racial profiling or prejudice, leading them to make wrongful assumptions about a person's intentions. 3. Lack of Communication: An officer may shoot due to a failure to properly communicate. For instance, if two officers are communicating at the same time, one may misunderstand the other, causing him to react with lethal force accidentally. 4. Poor Judgment: Sometimes, an officer may make a split-second decision that ends in tragedy. This is often a result of poor judgment or a misinterpretation of the situation. 5. High-Stress Environment: Police officers work in an extremely high-stress environment which can impair judgment. It is crucial for police departments to implement effective policies and training programs to ensure officers respond to situations appropriately to prevent incidents of this nature."

The reason is simple - if you are seen to be wearing one of these masks they will think you're trying to hide something from them.

Human,cmv-16,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if heshe doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing himher, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Tsinghua,cmv-16,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer be so careless? Maybe because the person who has been shot or killed was not just an innocent person but a drug dealer or a criminal? Maybe the police officer was just doing his job, but I do not think that it is right to shoot someone just because they are not supposed to be there. But what can we do to stop these shootings? We should tell the police to be more careful. We should also try to talk to our parents and grandparents about this because we have to be careful when we are out and about. Maybe the police will listen to us and they will try to be more careful. I think that it is really important to be careful and not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I think that the police should also be more careful and not shoot people who are not criminals. And I think that we should talk to our parents and grandparents about this so they will also be careful. If we do not stop this, there will be a lot more shootings. I think that it is important for us to stop this because it is a really bad thing to do to innocent people. 9. Do You Believe That Politicians Should Be Accountable For Their Actions? Yes. 10.

LLAMA,cmv-16,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot at someone who they think is a threat but they are not really? The police officers should stop and take a second to think about what they are doing and they should do better. Police officers should be more careful about who they shoot, because they are causing deaths. They are killing people who are innocent. Police officers are killing kids, and they are causing injuries. These are all people that have families and loved ones. These are people who have friends and these are people who have dreams. These are people who are going to grow up to be someone in the future. Why would a police officer want to take away their dreams? People who do not deserve to die are dying. These police officers are mistakely shooting people and they are not even taking responsibility for what they have done. If a police officer thinks a person is a threat, then they should at least know what they are doing. They should have a second thought about it, and they should really know if the person is a threat or not. If a police officer is going to shoot at someone, then they should know who they are shooting at. They should really know if that person is a threat or not. They should really know if the person is doing something wrong or if the person is just joking around. In conclusion, police officers should be more careful about who they shoot at and they should really know what they are doing. If a police officer is going to shoot at someone, then they should know who they are shooting at. police deaths police brutality Cesar California Letter to the next president regarding animal testing As a nation I think its important to recognize that animal testing is not necessary.

PaLM,cmv-16,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone? There are a few reasons why this might happen. First, police officers are often under a lot of stress. They are responsible for protecting the public, and they often have to make split-second decisions that could have life-or-death consequences. This stress can lead to mistakes, and in some cases, it can lead to officers using deadly force when it is not necessary. Second, police officers are often trained to use their firearms as a last resort. However, in some cases, they may be forced to use their firearms sooner than they would like, in order to protect themselves or others. This is especially true in cases where the suspect is armed and dangerous. Third, police officers are often not given the training they need to deal with people who are mentally ill or emotionally disturbed. This can lead to situations where officers are not able to de-escalate a situation peacefully, and they may end up using deadly force as a result. It is important to remember that police officers are human beings, and they are not immune to making mistakes. However, it is also important to remember that police officers are often put in dangerous situations, and they need to be able to protect themselves and others. In order to reduce the number of incidents where police officers shoot children or innocent people, there needs to be a number of changes made. First, police officers need to be given more training on how to deal with people who are mentally ill or emotionally disturbed. Second, police officers need to be given more training on how to de-escalate a situation peacefully. Third, police officers need to be held accountable for their actions, and they need to be punished when they use deadly force unnecessarily. By making these changes, we can help to reduce the number of incidents where police officers shoot children or innocent people."
Tsinghua,cmv-17,"A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country (i.e. Mandarin, English, Spanish, etc. in China). Excluding languages like English or French, which are not really primary languages. (It's difficult to argue that, for example, a language like English is the primary language of Canada because the vast majority of people in Canada are of English descent and thus the English language is the primary language of English descent.) It is wrong to think that if the population speaks a primary language in one area that it's their only language. In Canada, French and English are the primary languages, but there are many other languages spoken in Canada. To a certain extent, it's the same with India. Yes, Hindi is the primary language, but there are many other languages spoken in India. Similarly, China is the primary language, but there are many other languages spoken in China. For example, there are at least 2000 languages spoken in China. So the argument that it's the primary language is incorrect. Saying that a language is a primary language is only correct if the language is spoken by the majority of the population. If a language is spoken by a minority of the population, then it is not a primary language. For example, in Canada, there are only about 40 of people who speak English, so English is not the primary language of Canada. This is not to say that English is not spoken by a majority of the population, but it's not the primary language of Canada. To make it even more clear, in China, the official language is Chinese, but the primary language is Mandarin. To sum it up, if a language is spoken by a majority of the population, then it's the primary language."
BigScience,cmv-17,"A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that community. An example would be a linguistic majority in Quebec but an even greater population of non-francophones. The question is about ""significant other"" not ""other significant others."" This includes close family members and partners as well. A: In Canadian law there are no legal requirements for sign languages to be recognised. This does change though if you intend on applying for citizenship. There will be certain things they look at such as: If you have been born deafened then do you know how to use your hands properly? Do you understand what it means to give a concession? These tests can take anywhere from weeks to months depending upon how much assistance you need. So overall this depends upon whether or not you're intending to apply for citizenship or simply being able to communicate with those who aren't hearing impaired. A: Secondary Sign Language is generally associated with Deaf Culture because it's used daily. A common image used when referring to things like secondary signs is: But it doesn't stop them speaking their native tongue. It just allows them to communicate with more people using that same medium while still keeping up with regular speechwritten communication, albeit slower than normal. I don't think any specific legislation exists regarding the right to speak both your first and second foreign-language.

PaLM,cmv-17,"A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that region. I agree that having a common language is important for communication and cooperation. However, I don't think that it is necessary for everyone to speak the same language. In fact, I think that it can be beneficial to have multiple languages spoken in a country. This can help to promote diversity and understanding between different cultures. For example, in Canada, we have two official languages: English and French. This means that people from all over the world can come to Canada and still be able to communicate with each other. This has helped to create a more diverse and inclusive society. I also think that it is important to respect the rights of minority language groups. These groups have the right to use their own language and to have their language taught in schools. This is important for preserving their culture and heritage. Overall, I believe that having a common language is important, but I don't think that it is necessary for everyone to speak the same language. I think that it is more important to have a respect for different languages and cultures. Here are some additional points that I would like to make:  I think that it is important to have a common language for government and business purposes. This helps to ensure that everyone can understand the laws and regulations that apply to them. It also helps to facilitate communication between businesses and their customers.  I don't think that it is necessary for everyone to speak the same language at home. In fact, I think that it can be beneficial for children to learn multiple languages at an early age. This can help them to develop better communication skills and to be more open to different cultures.  I think that it is important to respect the rights of minority language groups. These groups have the right to use their own language and to have their language taught in schools. This is important for preserving their culture and heritage. I hope that this clarifies my view on the importance of language in a multicultural society."
Human,cmv-17,"A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country (i.e. English in America) I don't expect fluency. My mother has lived in Canada for almost twenty years now and she still has trouble sometimes. My view is that all immigrants should strive for at the very least an [intermediate] mastery. My one exception would be if an immigrant does not have the financial capability to pay for lessons in the language of the country they've moved to. However, in Canada at least, free English lessons are offered to new immigrants, so I wouldn't see any reason to not learn the language here. Not learning the primary language of the country they've moved to encourages segregation and often leads to racial or cultural tension. By refusing to learn the primary language to an acceptable extent, they're showing a blatant refusal to adapt even a little to their new country's culture. Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt. What's the point of coming all the way to another country if you're not going to respect it? Multiculturalism is wonderful and should be valued, but refusing to learn the country's language and creating enclaves is preventing multiculturalism. Hello, users of CMV!

LLAMA,cmv-17,"A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that area. So for Quebec, it would be French. For Newfoundland, it would be English. The primary language used to be English in Quebec. But in 1974 the Quebec government passed a law designating French as the primary language. Not only that, but the law banned the use of English in any public place (even stores and restaurants). As a result, the English-speaking minority in Quebec was essentially punished for speaking their language. The government began a program of discrimination against the English-speaking community. The problem with Quebec is that the majority of the French-speaking population believes that Canada should be a Francophone country. They feel as if the English-speaking minority in Canada is oppressing them. So I agree that French should be the primary language in Quebec. But English should also be accepted as a primary language in the rest of Canada. I don't understand why Quebec needs to be a Francophone province. I understand the need to protect the French language in Quebec. But there is no reason to discriminate against the English-speaking community. Fortunately, the Quebec government has eased up a bit on the use of English in public. But it still prohibits the use of English on signs. In a store, for example, the price tags must be in French. If there is an English-language sign, it must be smaller than the French sign. I don't know if you have ever been to Quebec, but the city of Montreal is bilingual. In the downtown area of Montreal, you will find a lot of English signs. So it's obvious that the people of Quebec do not have a problem with the use of English. The law is designed to protect the French language from being influenced by English. But this is a ridiculous idea. Languages are always influenced by other languages. The French language has been influenced by English for hundreds of years. I hope that Quebec can find a way to protect the French language without discriminating against the English-speaking minority. I'm not sure about the history, but I've heard that Quebec used to be an English-speaking province. The English-speaking minority in Quebec are the descendants of the original settlers of Quebec. They have been living there for hundreds of years, and now they are being persecuted for speaking their language. I understand the need to protect the French language. But there is no need to persecute the English-speaking community. Having read your earlier comment on my blog, and responding to it, I thought I should take a look at your blog. You say you are not sure of the history, but you do seem to have an opinion on the Quebec situation. I guess you are talking about the period of British rule in Quebec, following the defeat of the French, at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The situation in Quebec is very much a complicated one. It's not just a matter of the French trying to preserve their language, in Quebec, and the English speaking minority trying to preserve theirs. Firstly, as I have mentioned to you before, French is the official language of Quebec, and it is by no means unreasonable for the province to expect everyone to use it, when dealing with the government. Secondly, the French speaking majority in Quebec are also trying to preserve their language, and their culture. I understand what you are saying about English being influenced by other languages. In fact, English is a very adaptable language, and it seems to me to be constantly evolving. However, in the case of Quebec, the French are very much aware that if they are not careful, the English language will swamp them, and they will become assimilated. What the French in Quebec are trying to do is keep their language and their culture, and there's nothing wrong with that. Of course the French-speaking majority in Quebec have every right to preserve their language and culture. I think it's great that they are so proud of their language and culture. But in the process, the government of Quebec has taken extreme measures against the English-speaking minority. I agree that English is adaptable and is constantly evolving. But this does not mean that the French language will be swamped. The French people in Quebec are already so established that there is no threat of assimilation. So there is no reason for the government to persecute the English-speaking community. I think we are going to have to agree to disagree on this. I think you"

I just politely declined. The guy who is now my husband, on the other hand, started making me uncomfortable when he told me he wanted to be friends with me because he could see the way I was looking at him. I felt my body stiffen and my stomach turn over. I couldn't eat, and my mind started to race. I told him I was sorry but I was not interested in him. I told him that I would not be his friend if he ever tried to have sex with me. He assured me that he would never do that, and I believed him. He didn't. I think that the real problem is that I never believed him. When I look back, I realize that I did feel some attraction to him. The way he smiled at me was different than the way he smiled at the others. I'm not sure what it was. I just felt different about him. But, that's all I felt. I still loved my husband, and that's all I cared about. So, I never went down that road. I hope this helps.

I have many male friends, and I like it that way. I am also having an issue with my daughter, because she has a difficult time accepting the fact that I am friends with men, and she thinks that I am having affairs with them. This is causing a lot of stress, because she will not speak to me, unless she wants something. I have tried to explain to her, that I am not having any affairs with any of these men, and they are just friends. She does not understand that I cannot just get up and leave these people in my life, because she wants me to. She does not understand that I need these people in my life, and that I am not the only one that gains from this.

Human,cmv-18,"I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal when I wasn't in a relationship and I would just turn them down. Once I was, they all tried much harder than usual to pursue something whereas before it was a more passive attempt. Once they realized I was ""off the table"" of sorts and was serious about my now boyfriend, the relationship just dwindled despite my continuing to talk to them just as much as before. I realized this was because the conversation would always be very short due to me not replying to flirtatious texts which probably got really boring for them. What I mean by men and women cannot be just friends is that one or the other (possibly both), even if not having a physical relationship, is using each other for the ego boost that comes with someone of the opposite sex giving you attention and would under other circumstances, definitely hook up (or maybe at one point in time already have). I also noticed even women who have a lot of male friends they spent a lot of time with and ""friend zoned"" them, they would still get weird and upset if the man was in a romantic relationship and therefore had less time to expend for her because it was going to his SO. This doesn't happen with their male friends as long as they see them enough because the male friends aren't using their male friends to feel attractive... but suddenly ""just"" female friends tend to get very territorial once they aren't getting the attention from the male friend that they were used to or able to get that constant validation. Of course there will ALWAYS be exceptions. But I think, on average, this all proves to be true. This is also why I am pretty uncomfortable with my boyfriend having female friends that aren't also people I've met and felt comfortable with. He can, of course, but it makes me feel uncomfortable. The one he introduced me to automatically displayed the classic signs of using him for attention and being very touchy but pretending it's simply a ""brother"" like relationship. I would like to be comfortable with such friendships but it seems unnecessary to me within a relationship. In a group setting is fine, of course, as long as everyone is comfortable (which doesn't seem to happen if the friend has been in the persons life longer than the SO) but I am talking about opposite sex friendships when one or both parties are in a relationship with other people...I feel they have no reason to spend a lot of time interacting or spending time together one-on-one unless they are both lying to each other (or one person is) and hoping that something will happen (sexually or otherwise) without admitting it to themselves or like the [in my opinion] inappropriate feeling of playing with fire. I hold myself to the same standard, of course. My one male friend that has not tried anything was also my roommate but I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even. We would hang out alone sometimes but in public (during daytime) or just while one or the other is in the kitchen cooking. I don't think anything would happen if we did drink alone, as we have before I was dating my boyfriend, but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway. I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me. This is ONE of those exceptions out of the plenty of male friends who out of nowhere have tried to hook up or tell me they have feelings for me and I suspect is not the average dynamic of a male-female friendship. So while I think it MAY be possible, it is somewhat rare. Obviously my view also applies to those who are strictly in monogamous relationships. Tl;dr: Most men who have female ""platonic"" friends would sleep with them if the opportunity arose and if are in a relationship, only keep them around in case and because of the ego boost of being around women who aren't unattractive (to feel wanted). Most women who have male ""platonic"" friends are using them for the attention they get by feeling a man likes them, and can't have them to feel like a sought-after, high quality woman...and also get jealous when they begin dating a woman despite their ""just friend"" claims. always exceptions, but believe this to be generally true."
Tsinghua,cmv-19,"I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; I have stood up for the rights of those who don't have the luxury of being white, male, and straight. I am, I think, a moderate to liberal on most issues. And yet, I am now convinced that I am, in fact, a conservative. I have no idea why. Perhaps it is because I grew up in a family where there was a clear divide between the left and the right, with my parents and my uncle being the former and my grandparents and aunt being the latter. I don't know. I'm not a political scientist. I do know that I believe in some very fundamental principles of liberty, equality, and the dignity of every human being. I also know that, at least to me, these principles have very little to do with the details of policy. I know that, as an individual, I am responsible for my own actions, and I am entitled to live my life in whatever manner I see fit. I also know that the state has a responsibility to protect its citizens, and that, while I believe that most of its laws are ultimately arbitrary and even unconstitutional, it has a right to keep its citizens safe. And I know that, in the United States, the majority of the citizens live under the Constitution. That is not the case in many other countries. I am convinced that the purpose of the state is to protect its citizens, and that, while the role of government is to protect its citizens, its role is not to serve as the chief administrator of their lives. The state is there to protect, not to govern. I know that, while we may be divided on the details, there are many things we can agree on. The rights of homosexuals and women are very important to me, as they are to most Americans. I do not believe that it is my job to tell others how they should live their lives, and I believe that it is not my job to tell them how they should think. I know that, while I believe in personal responsibility, I also believe that we have a responsibility to the next generation. The fact that I believe that some things are wrong is not the same as saying that all things are wrong. I also know that the state has a role to play in keeping us safe, but that the government should not have a role in determining what is good or bad. I know that we have a moral obligation to care for the elderly, the sick, and the poor, but that the government should not have a role in determining what is good or bad. I know that the government has a role in ensuring that we have food, shelter, and medical care, but that the government should not have a role in determining what is good or bad. I know that the government has a role in ensuring that we have a strong economy, but that the government should not have a role in determining what is good or bad. I know that we need to be careful in how we allocate our resources, but that the government should not have a role in determining what is good or bad. I know that, while I believe in individual responsibility, I also believe that the government should not have a role in determining what is good or bad. And, in many ways, I have known that for a long time. But I think it is important to be clear about what this does not mean. I am not saying that I think government is bad, or that I think the government should be reduced to the point where it is ineffective. I am not saying that I think that the government should be so small that it has no role to play in our lives. I am not saying that I think that there should be no role for government at all. What I am saying is that, for the most part, I do not believe that the government should have a role in determining what is good or bad. I do not believe that the government should tell me what I can and cannot do. I do not believe that the government should tell me how I should live my life. I do not believe that the government should tell me what I should think. And I do not believe that the government should tell me what is good or bad. What I am saying is that, for the most part, I do not believe that the government should have a role in determining what is good or bad. I do not believe that the government should tell me what I can and cannot do. I do not believe that the government should tell me how I should live my life. I do not believe that the government should tell me what I should think. And I do not believe that the government should tell me what is good or bad. This is a big change for me. I am not sure what it means."
Human,cmv-19,"I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; however, I do not feel like this stance has benefited me in the slightest.

I have not read Ayn Rand, nor do I ever intend to, as I consider her philosophy to be frankly immoral. Moral people should look out for their fellow humans. However, I believe that I would be better served by pursuing my own rational self-interest rather than spending even an ounce of my resources on the betterment of others who will just attribute my good deed to their god anyway most likely. Donating to charity might prevent a child from dying from cancer, but I am not a child and I don't have cancer, so that extra dollar from my pocket is better spent being used as tax on my latest board game purchase.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-19,"I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life.

The end result is simple: The GOP has never had an intellectual class just people who are basically ignorant idiots or opportunistic politicians looking out not only their own interests first - no one believes someone would actually vote on purely logical grounds once so completely indoctrinated by media propaganda -but also taking advantage when there was profit involved from short-term greediness even if social stability were threatened long term... which this current fiasco shows us clearly enough! It makes me sad every time i see another conservative using ""liberal"" pejoratively again after his party betrayed him yet more over these last decades - and we're getting closer now since most Americans seem desperate at all costs rather then having any real hope left about changing things without revolution though obviously he thinks paying them off will work where nothing else ever did before....or maybe neither side realizes how much damage could come forth should citizens' right rise up..?"
BigScience,cmv-19,"I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; I voted to repeal taxes on gasoline; I've opposed abortion restrictions. The libertarian philosophy has basically convinced me that government is the problem, not the solution. When you start thinking about it this way, it's hard to see why a government that actually does things like provide health care or schools would be any different than one that's actively aiding and abetting Big Pharma by imposing regulatory burdens andor taxing drug companies. Why should we believe these people when they claim they're going to give us better products at lower prices? But there are still some in Congress who think otherwise. They argue for expansion of government power, whether through government-run healthcare, education, national security measures such as the Patriot Acts, or limitations on individual liberty. One old standby is Obamacare - which led directly into the coronavirus crisis but there's nothing stopping them from using their influence over future legislators if they ever get elected again. What can ordinary Americans do? The first thing I'd recommend doing is learning more about politics and elections. There will always be ignorant folks around claiming to know what you're really thinking, so take time each week to research your candidates online before deciding where you'd vote based on those resultsopinions. (If an election were held today between Donald Trump and Joe Biden both of whom are known far-righters only 53 percent could correctly pick the candidate's party.) You don't need to spend much money either: just visit sites such as PolitiFact.org and Another great resource is Vox. It's owned by New York Times publisher John Druckerman who was co-founder of Propublica. This site offers conservative commentary, news updates, and voting guides all with thoughtful analysis backed up by factual information."
LLAMA,cmv-19,"I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; I have worked to reduce global warming; I have argued in favor of raising taxes on the wealthy; I have opposed racism, homophobia, misogyny, and discrimination of all sorts; and I have in general worked to further the progressive project. My Facebook friends are primarily liberals and I live in a liberal city in a liberal state. I am very much a part of the liberal tribe. I started writing this book because I was alarmed at the degree of intolerance that I was seeing among my fellow liberals. It seemed as though there was a greater willingness to hear opposing views in the past. Over the course of the past few years, I watched as many liberals changed into something different. There was less tolerance of opposing views, more name-calling, and more ad hominem attacks. It seemed to me that many liberals had become as close-minded as the conservatives they criticized. Liberals like to think of themselves as open-minded and for the most part that is true. But there is a growing trend toward intolerance. Intolerance for those who do not share our views is a natural and, to some extent, even a reasonable human response. What I'm talking about is a kind of knee-jerk reaction that shuts down open discussion. There is a tendency among liberals, when confronted with views they disagree with, to try to silence those who hold them. As a liberal, I share many of the values of my fellow liberals, but I find some of their tactics offensive. This book is a call for liberalism to return to its roots as a philosophy of openness, tolerance, and free speech. I am a cognitive scientist and I believe that we can learn a lot about the sources of liberal intolerance by thinking carefully about the ways in which human minds work. I also believe that understanding the sources of liberal intolerance can help us do something about it. This book is aimed at liberals because the greatest danger we face today comes not from conservatives but from within the liberal ranks. But I welcome everyone to this conversation. There is no single cause of liberal intolerance, and in fact, the causes are surprisingly diverse. I will argue that many of the causes of liberal intolerance stem from the very values and ideals that liberals cherish most. That is why I have entitled this book The Righteous Mind. We are all righteous. We all think we are right and that those who disagree with us are wrong. I am not accusing liberals of being any more self-righteous than conservatives. I believe we are all equally self-righteous. The problem is that our righteous minds were ""designed"" by evolution to help us do good, but sometimes they lead us astray. The first part of this book will explore the sources of liberal intolerance and the second part will explore how we can overcome these obstacles. I will argue that the two most important steps to reducing liberal intolerance are understanding and empathy. Understanding requires that we see things from the perspective of our opponents and that we understand the moral roots of their views. I will also argue that it is not enough for liberals to understand conservatives - we must also try to understand everyone, including people we find abhorrent. I will show that one of the major obstacles to understanding is the human tendency to demonize our opponents. The only effective way to overcome this obstacle is through empathy - feeling what our opponents feel. Empathy is a powerful force in human relations that can bridge even the greatest of divides. I will show that empathy is not enough. We also have to engage our opponents in open and honest discussion. I will show that this is not easy, but that it is possible. I have written this book to start a conversation. It is my hope that in this conversation we can begin to overcome our differences and find a way to respect and cherish each other, even when we disagree. PART I The Sources of Liberal Intolerance ONE The Moral Roots of Liberals and Conservatives I am a liberal and I live in a liberal city (Boston) in a liberal state (Massachusetts).

Human,cmv-20,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless? Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering? I personally believe life is meaningless. When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living? The only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you. But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering. Its been something I've been thinking a lot about lately.... Change my view, please. Also, this is not a cry for help and I will not be jumping off the golden gate bridge any time soon."
OpenAI,cmv-20,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If that is the case, then why do you think people should strive to live a good life and make a positive impact on the world? There are many possible answers to this question, but one possible answer is that living a good life and making a positive impact on the world can bring joy, fulfillment, and purpose to one's life, as well as contribute to the well-being and flourishing of others. Even if there is no afterlife or supernatural reward, many people may still choose to live a good life and make a positive impact out of a sense of responsibility, compassion, empathy, or altruism. In addition, many people may find that their values and beliefs are grounded in rational and empirical considerations, such as the value of human life, the importance of justice, the need for cooperation and empathy, or the scientific understanding of the universe."

I know that some people would say that the point of life is to enjoy it while we can. To experience all that the world has to offer and to make the most of our time here. But even if we do that, what's the point if it all ends in nothingness? I've heard the argument that the point of life is to make a difference in the world. To leave our mark on history and to make the world a better place for future generations. But even if we do that, what's the point if we won't be around to see it? I'm not sure if I'll ever find an answer to this question. But I think it's important to keep pondering it. Because if we don't, then we're just going through the motions without ever really understanding why we're here."
Tsinghua,cmv-20,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If it was true that the soul does live on after death, it is pretty much irrelevant what happens to the body. I would think that the ""life"" of the soul would last as long as it's in a state of consciousness, which I guess is how the body is. So what happens when the body is dead? It dies as well and the life of the soul ends. I don't know how this relates to reincarnation. I'm not familiar with the concept. However, I don't see how it is logically possible for the life of the soul to continue on if the body is dead. I think the best explanation I have come up with is that there is some sort of other-worldly entity that lives on after the body is gone. This could be the soul or the energy left behind. It's really up to you which you believe. As for reincarnation, I can't say for sure. I don't know much about it. I would say that if reincarnation is true, the life of the soul would continue on. But again, I don't know much about it. I'm not sure how this relates to the reincarnation but I think it is relevant. You know, there are people who say they have been reborn multiple times, so it could be possible. But I don't know how. I would like to know more about it. I hope this has helped a little bit.:) 13 Answers I believe reincarnation is true, but not because of the Bible. It's not the Bible that says that people have souls. It's the Bible that says people have souls, but it's not the Bible that says that people have souls that continue to exist after death. The Bible doesn't say that. It doesn't say that, for example, there is a living being that continues to exist after death. It says there is a living being that continues to exist after death, but it doesn't say that the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul. It says the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul, but it doesn't say that the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul that continues to exist after death. The Bible says there is a living being that continues to exist after death, and the Bible says the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul, but the Bible doesn't say the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul that continues to exist after death. So I don't think the Bible says anything about reincarnation. The Bible says there is a living being that continues to exist after death, and the Bible says the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul, but the Bible doesn't say the living being that continues to exist after death is a soul that continues to exist after death. The Bible doesn't say that people have souls. It says people have souls, but it doesn't say that people have souls that continue to exist after death. So I don't think the Bible says anything about reincarnation. I don't know if this has helped you, but I'm just saying this in case you want to know more about reincarnation. I don't think the Bible says anything about reincarnation, but I do think it is true. I believe reincarnation is true because there is no proof that people don't have souls, and there is no proof that people do have souls that continue to exist after death. So I don't think the Bible says anything about reincarnation, but I do think it is true. I believe reincarnation is true because there is no proof that people don't have souls, and there is no proof that people do have souls that continue to exist after death. 13 years ago I met a guy who claimed he had been born and died three times. He had a child with his second wife, but then lost his memory, but his second wife did not. He claimed he had died twice and was reborn three times. When I asked him if he thought he was still reborn, he said no, he was just confused. I think it is possible that people do have souls that continue to exist after death. There are some people who believe that people do have souls that continue to exist after death, and there are some people who believe that people don't have souls that continue to exist after death. I believe reincarnation is true because there is no proof that people don't have souls, and there is no proof that people do have souls that continue to exist after death."
BigScience,cmv-20,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If anything, I would say that we are all moving towards the end of our lives and nothing is beyond God's control. That aside, there has always been an element in my mind with regards to this concept: how do you know what will be? You can only guess at the future if something happens outside your control (death); however, the thing about these things is...well, it's just speculation! We can't really count on anything! So back to today's challenge - you may think ""I would take better care of myself today"" or ""Today wasn't so great for me emotionally - I should start doing more yoga and meditation tomorrow!!""

I've seen several folks getting involved making sure to join classes here at CLC.

LLAMA,cmv-20,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If I'm dead, I'm dead. I'm gone. My brain has ceased functioning. In saying that, I have noticed that there are a lot of things that make me question the claims of theists. If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need a Church for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need a prophet for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be worshiped for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be revered for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be feared for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be loved for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be glorified for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be prayed to for? If there is an omnipotent, omniscient God, then what does he need to be obeyed for? I can understand why a theist might believe in a god if there were many gods and they were not all knowing. But in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic god, there is only one. And he is the creator of everything. And he knows everything. Why do we need to do anything for him? He should be above and beyond all of this. The ""greatest commandment"" is to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul. Well, I'm just not feeling it. If there is a god, he does not seem to be very good at communicating with us. I can't imagine that he would be the least bit interested in me. I find it very odd that so many people are interested in God, but God is not interested in them. Maybe God should be dead? Thanks. I think that there is a lot of common sense in the arguments that I have read from atheists."
LLAMA,cmv-21,"The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it's not what the discussion centers around. I think it's rather important to look at them separately, because they can be different. And in many cases, they are. There is no other area where the distinction is more apparent than with the issue of same sex marriage. Whereas many people do not support same sex marriage on moral grounds, most support the legality of it. Most people agree that the government should have no say in the matter, even if they disagree with it morally. That's a good example of how the two can be different. I have already said that I believe abortion is morally wrong. I have also said that I support the legality of abortion. I would prefer that abortions did not happen, but that is a completely separate issue. I am not arguing that abortions should be legalized, because they are already legal. I'm arguing that they should stay that way. I believe that the legality of abortion is a separate issue. Whether abortion should be legal or illegal is a separate issue from whether abortion should be moral or immoral. They are two different things. How is the question of morality different from legality? The law has to do with what the state can or cannot do. What the state cannot do is make abortion illegal. It can't punish abortion in any way because that would violate a woman's rights. It can, however, promote an anti-abortion culture. It can spend money on pro-life resources. It can implement programs that help pregnant women. It can do a lot of things that would make abortion less common, but it cannot make it illegal. Morality, on the other hand, has to do with what an individual can or cannot do. Morality is about what is right and what is wrong. It's about what people ought and ought not to do. It's about the individual and not the state. I believe that the government should not try to legislate morality. It's not the government's job to enforce what is right and what is wrong. That's the job of the individual. We have the right to choose what we believe is right and wrong, and the government should not take that right away. Because of that, I believe that abortion should be legal. There is no justification for making it illegal, since that would violate the rights of a woman. The government does have the responsibility of enforcing the law. That is its job. But it does not have the responsibility of enforcing morality. It does not have the right to enforce what is right and what is wrong. That's the job of the individual. If a woman decides that abortion is wrong, then she should not have an abortion. That's the individual's choice. The government should not enforce what is right and what is wrong, because that is a violation of rights. Essentially, the difference is that the law has to do with what the state can and cannot do, while morality has to do with what the individual can and cannot do. What about the Constitution? Abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution. You'll find that it's not mentioned in the Declaration of Independence either. In fact, you'll find that it's not mentioned in any government document at all. Does this mean that abortion is not a right? No. The Constitution only establishes the powers of the government. It does not establish individual rights. There is a reason for this. The Constitution is a document that is meant to protect the individual from the government. It's meant to protect your rights from the government, not the other way around. If there were a document that established our rights, then the government would have the power to violate those rights by amending the document. The Constitution does not have to say anything about abortion for it to be a right. There are many rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. For example, the right to privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution, yet it is still a right. The right to a fair trial is not mentioned in the Constitution, yet it is still a right. There are many rights that we have that are not mentioned in the Constitution, and abortion is one of them. The Constitution does not have to mention abortion for it to be a right. The right to privacy is one of the rights that is not mentioned in the Constitution. It is something that was established by the Supreme Court. The right to privacy"
Human,cmv-21,"The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is often well after substantial ambiguous conversation. For the purpose of this CMV, I will grant that a fetus is a human person. My views: 1. Abortion may or may not be morally permissible, though I lean towards permissible. I don't really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it's here for some background on my position. 2. Abortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother's legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus' (or child's) right to use them. One of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I'd prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I've heard is as follows: Let's say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can't be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9 months to a fetus to keep it alive. EDIT: There are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first: ugarnteller: So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it? My realization as I thought through the implications: This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario: In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters. Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law.... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen. So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time. This seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body. I guess if a fetus really is a person, it probably should be illegal to abort it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Tsinghua,cmv-21,"The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line. But, as I've mentioned before, the abortion issue is a battle of beliefs. Abortion is wrong, that is a moral issue. Abortion is legal, that is a legal issue. Abortion is moral, that is a philosophical issue. Abortion is legal, that is a political issue. I would also like to add, that I agree with Richard Dawkins, that abortion is wrong, even if it is legal. However, I disagree with the premise that the morality of abortion is the same as the legality of abortion. That is a false premise. It is not a false premise. It's just that there are other, more fundamental issues that we're discussing here, issues that are important enough to discuss on a blog. I don't think that abortion is wrong. I think that it is something that should be allowed and supported by the government, and, thus, it is a legal issue. The debate about the morality of abortion and the legality of abortion is just that, a debate about the morality of abortion and the legality of abortion. There is no objective answer to this debate. It's up to the conscience of each individual, just as it is with the issue of the legality of killing children in abortion clinics. The moral position is that killing a human being is wrong, regardless of the legality of the act. The legal position is that killing a human being is legal, regardless of the morality of the act. 2.2.5. Infanticide: Some believe that the death of a baby at birth is not murder. If so, this means that we should be allowed to kill infants at birth, which would mean that infants at birth would be free from the duty to protect them. The argument for infanticide is the same as the argument for abortion, but applied to the fetus rather than the baby. As with the argument for abortion, I think that this is a false premise. It's just that there are other, more fundamental issues that we're discussing here, issues that are important enough to discuss on a blog. It's true that I think that it is wrong to kill an infant at birth. However, I don't think that it is wrong to kill a baby at birth. That's the difference between abortion and infanticide. 2.2.6. Infanticide: In some societies, abortion is illegal. In other societies, abortion is legal. In other societies, there is a mixture of laws. Some of these laws allow abortion, but in some circumstances. Some of these laws allow abortion in all circumstances. Others allow abortion in some circumstances, but not in others. In addition, there are other laws that allow the killing of infants at birth, but in some circumstances. Some of these laws allow infanticide, but in some circumstances. Some of these laws allow infanticide in all circumstances. Others allow infanticide in some circumstances, but not in others. It's important to note that infanticide is not the same as abortion. Abortion is the killing of a baby after it is born, while infanticide is the killing of an infant before it is born. It is the difference between abortion and infanticide that separates these two issues from the abortion issue. Abortion is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. Infanticide is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. 2.2.7. The Pro-LifePro-Choice Debate: There is no such thing as a pro-life position, or a pro-choice position. There is a pro-life issue, and there is a pro-choice issue. The pro-life issue is that abortion is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. The pro-choice issue is that abortion is legal, regardless of whether it is moral or immoral. Abortion is legal, regardless of whether it is moral or immoral. Abortion is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. I think that the debate over the legality of abortion is a false debate. It's just that there are other, more fundamental issues that we're discussing here, issues that are important enough to discuss on a blog. 2.2.8. Abortion: The reason that there is a pro-lifepro-choice debate is that there is a debate about the morality of abortion. The pro-life position is that abortion is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. The pro-choice position is that abortion is legal, regardless of whether it is moral or immoral. Abortion is legal, regardless of whether it is moral or immoral. Abortion is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal."
OpenAI,cmv-21,"The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is important to note the difference. Morality refers to personal beliefs and values about what is right and wrong, while legality refers to what is permitted by the law. So, someone could believe that abortion is morally wrong, but still believe that it should be legal for others to obtain. On the other hand, someone could believe that abortion is morally permissible, but think that it should be illegal for various reasons such as concerns for the person's health or other societal implications. It's important to keep in mind these distinctions and to have respectful conversations with others who may have different beliefs or opinions."
PaLM,cmv-21,"The distinction between the morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it's often not the main focus of the debate. This is a mistake, because the two issues are fundamentally different. The morality of abortion is a question of personal ethics. There is no one right answer, and people will come to different conclusions based on their own beliefs and values. The legality of abortion, on the other hand, is a question of public policy. It's about how we want to structure our society and what rights we want to protect. It's important to keep these two issues separate, because conflating them can lead to confusion and unproductive arguments. For example, someone who is pro-life might argue that abortion is murder and should therefore be illegal. However, someone who is pro-choice might argue that abortion is a personal decision that should be left up to the woman involved. Both of these arguments are valid, but they're talking about two different things. The first argument is about the morality of abortion, while the second argument is about the legality of abortion. It's also important to remember that the legality of abortion does not necessarily reflect the morality of abortion. In other words, just because abortion is legal doesn't mean that it's morally right, and just because abortion is illegal doesn't mean that it's morally wrong. The legality of abortion is a matter of public policy, and it's up to each society to decide what it wants to do. The distinction between the morality of abortion and its legality is an important one, and it's one that we should all be aware of. When we engage in discussions about abortion, it's important to keep these two issues separate so that we can have productive and meaningful conversations. ## The Morality of Abortion The morality of abortion is a complex and controversial issue. There are many different arguments that can be made on both sides of the issue. Some of the most common arguments in favor of abortion include:  A woman has the right to control her own body. This is a fundamental principle of bodily autonomy, and it means that a woman should be able to make decisions about her own reproductive health, including whether or not to have an abortion.  Abortion is a necessary medical procedure. In some cases, abortion is the only way to save a woman's life or to prevent serious health problems.  Abortion is a morally neutral act. There is no one right answer to the question of whether or not abortion is morally wrong. People will come to different conclusions based on their own beliefs and values. Some of the most common arguments against abortion include:  Abortion is the killing of an innocent human being. This is a deeply held belief for many people, and it's one of the main reasons why they oppose abortion.  Abortion is harmful to women. There is some evidence to suggest that abortion can have negative psychological and emotional effects on women.  Abortion is morally wrong. Many people believe that abortion is morally wrong, and they believe that it should be illegal. The morality of abortion is a complex and controversial issue, and there is no easy answer. There are valid arguments to be made on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, each person must decide for themselves whether or not they believe that abortion is morally wrong. ## The Legality of Abortion The legality of abortion is a matter of public policy. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is a constitutionally protected right. However, this right is not absolute, and states can regulate abortion in certain ways. The most common ways that states regulate abortion are by:  Setting a gestational limit. This is the maximum amount of time that a woman can be pregnant before she can have an abortion.  Requiring parental consent or notification. This means that a woman must get the consent of her parents before she can have an abortion, or that she must notify her parents that she is going to have an abortion.  Mandating counseling. This means that a woman must receive counseling before she can have an abortion.  Prohibiting certain types of abortions. This includes abortions that are performed after a certain gestational age or abortions that are performed for certain reasons (such as race or sex selection). The legality of abortion is a constantly evolving issue. As society changes, so too do the laws that govern abortion. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to restrict abortion access, and this has led to a number of court cases and legislative battles. The future of abortion law in the United States is uncertain, but it is clear that this is an issue that will continue to be debated for"
BigScience,cmv-21,"The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line to try and make an argument for one or the other position but in my opinion they're both misguided. While there are many cases where a woman may decide that having their baby means putting her life at risk (like due to medical reasons), I don't think anyone should be forced into taking such a decision out of their own hands just because society says so. (And I'm not talking about situations like rape). There are some women who do this all the time it's called coercion on any number of levels from family pressure to religion. It's still wrong in every way practically speaking even if you're forcing yourself to get pregnant against your will. There was also something else you said which made me laugh: ""But these people probably went through hell as kids, didn't they?"" Yes, indeedy! But believe me; most have had enough suffering already in life without being told by others how to live their lives! Another thing I've heard people say that's not correct either...that we shouldn't judge those poor men only based on what happened to them during the act because he could've been thinking about killing himself before starting the actual act. Doesn't matter whether it's him asking his wife to stop or she stopping herself. If he's planning suicide then no amount of sex can save him; yes, even if she's stopped herself first with pills. In fact, according to studies done recently, going back to living together doesn't necessarily mean he'll change his mind about getting rid of the child."

They collapse once you get into it and there is nothing else. Another one, I was reading an article on The Daily Mail about the same phenomenon of people buying fake love in online dating sites. Everyone has heard how scammers try to sell their products with false promises that they can solve problems for free. From films to romantic books, we have read them all before but here things go too far! Nowadays this scam exists also in real life - perfecting online dating websites where everything must be paid for. We have seen examples when men appealed as well as women who were victims of these fraudsters! Some even manage to sign up in actual psychic services via webcam, which then sells its own way of controlling those living in another continent... Even if some find out later what actually happens during such sessions. But anyway, I'm thinking why do people believe so much? Why can't someone just look at reality instead of looking through a lens? Roberts says that it's because 'the whole package' seems better than any other option available. Sounds logical doesn't it? So first off let's call a spade a spade: money changes perspective. You could say it makes us crazy which would explain some weird behaviors that seem to happen more often after seeing somebody's wallet full of cash (e.g., buying something only to endlessly regret later). However not every time your wallet gets heavier does it mean you're getting crazier; sometimes it's even indicative of health issues... Money buys freedom from fear. It brings comfort and provides material security thus giving us confidence enough to face our fears without wondering anymore ""what will my next meal cost""? However keep in mind that nobody dreams of having a million dollars lying around hisher house. No matter how rich you may become courtesy of financial-magical illusionism, you still don't realize how lucky you truly are until you see others struggling no matter how many millions heshe owns."

PaLM,cmv-23,"I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I'm not alone in this. According to a recent poll, 60% of young people under the age of 30 identify as independents or Democrats. This is a significant shift from previous generations, who were more likely to identify with the Republican Party. The GOP's out-of-touch policies on social issues are a major reason for this shift. Young people are increasingly supportive of LGBTQ rights, reproductive rights, and secularism. They also believe that the government should play a role in addressing climate change and income inequality. The GOP's stance on these issues is not only unpopular with young people, but it's also bad for the country. For example, the GOP's opposition to comprehensive sex education and access to contraception has led to a rise in unplanned pregnancies and STIs. The GOP's war on women's reproductive rights has also made it more difficult for women to get the healthcare they need. The GOP's anti-science stance on climate change is also a threat to our planet. Climate change is real, and it's already having a devastating impact on our communities. The GOP's refusal to take action on climate change is putting our future at risk. The GOP's policies are not only bad for young people, but they're also bad for the country. If you're a young person who cares about your future, you should vote Democrat."

Human,cmv-23,"I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I know that people tend to surround themselves with like minded people, be it consciously or not, so the thought of the GOP being unable to ever win another presidential election has crawled into my head. (TL;DR in bold.) The social issues I'm talking about are: LGBT issues such as same sex marriage, religious freedom laws, ""bathroom bills"" involving trans people, etc. Their black and white stance on abortion- some of them want no exceptions for cases of terrible fetal deformities, threats to the life of the mother (Scott Walker in the last debate), rape, incest, etc. Fighting against contraceptives and the morning after pill that could prevent unwanted pregnancies and prevent abortions Pushing abstinence only sex ed. [37 states allow for medically inaccurate information to be taught to students as ""fact,"" so long as it scares them out of having sex. My school was one of the ones that taught blatantly incorrect information.] Claiming that anthroprogenic climate change isn't real, and pushing the teaching of intelligent design in public schools Marijuana legalization Being so biblereligion based when the population seems to be shifting away from religion Please please please change my view! I live in Ohio, so I really can't let myself slide into apathy thinking that the GOP has no hope of winning anything! You don't need to change my views on the social issues at hand, just convince me that another Republican president isn't out of the question! Edit 1: Wow! Lots of responses- awesome! It's going to take me a few minutes to sift through all this.:D Edit 2: Delta awarded- if a candidate like Hillary gets the democratic nomination and young people who are frustrated with government express that frustration by just staying home on election day, it will definitely give Republicans an advantage, no matter their stance on the issues. Edit 3: Please cite sources if possible. Feelings and anecdotes don't hold the same weight as things like polling data from reputable institutions, academic studies, etc. Edit 4: Another delta awarded- to uWhiskeyCoke77 for a good academic explanation of issue salience, how some voters find some issues more important than others.

A hand slid free of her arm to ease its grip on the edge of her dress. It moved past the side of her neck, pinching softly just beneath her collarbone without moving faster than gentle caress. ""We've known each other long enough to judge your sense of humor, little girl-and you're clearly failing miserably.""

OpenAI,cmv-24,"To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are safe for consumption as genes that have been developed through traditional breeding methods. GMOs are strictly regulated and tested by various governmental agencies, including the FDA, before being approved for consumption. However, it is important to note that some concerns have been raised about the environmental impacts of GMOs, including issues such as cross-pollination of GMO crops with non-GMO crops, the creation of superweeds, and the potential impacts on beneficial insects and other wildlife. Scientific studies continue to investigate these concerns and evaluate the safety of GMOs for human consumption and the environment. It is also important to note that, although there are no peer-reviewed studies demonstrating a direct link between GMOs and negative health effects, there are still debates and concerns among experts about the potential long-term effects of consuming GMOs, as well as doubts about their ability to increase crop yields and reduce the use of pesticides in the long term. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the overall benefits and risks of GMOs."
LLAMA,cmv-24,"To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are any less safe than those manipulated in the field. I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty of studies that claim to show that GMOs are harmful in some way. However, the vast majority of these studies have been debunked by experts in the field. This is a common theme when it comes to pseudoscience, for some reason the anti-science crowd seems to have a much easier time getting funding than legitimate scientists. The only way to make sure that you are avoiding GMOs is to grow your own food. If you do not do that then you will have to rely on your food producer to tell you what is in your food. GMOs are absolutely necessary if we want to have enough food in the future. They will help increase the yield of crops, allowing more food to be grown on the same amount of land. There is no evidence whatsoever that GMOs are harmful to the environment or to the people that eat them. On the contrary, they have been shown to be more environmentally friendly. There are so many benefits to using GMOs that it is actually kind of scary to think that people might not be allowed to use them in the future. I think people are worried about GMOs because they seem unnatural. However, I think people are being a little too quick to judge because I think that GMOs are going to be very important for the future of the human race. I feel that many people are against GMOs simply because they do not understand what they are and how they work. I am sure that if people were given the chance to learn more about them then they would be less likely to be against them. GMOs are perfectly safe. The only reason that we have to label them is because of consumer demand. It is unfortunate that so many people are falling for the lies and propaganda of the anti-GMO crowd. GMOs are the most important development in agriculture since we started planting crops. They are the only way we can ensure that we will be able to feed the billions of extra people that will be on this planet in the future. I am convinced that GMOs are one of the most important technologies for our future. Without them we will never be able to ensure that everyone will be able to have access to a healthy diet. I would argue that the biggest negative impact of GMOs is that they are causing many people to go hungry around the world. There are many places that have refused to use GMOs and the crops that are being grown there are simply not enough to feed the population. The problem is that there are a lot of people that do not understand what GMOs are and how they work. This has caused them to be afraid of them, which is really a shame. I think that we will have to start doing more to educate the general population on what GMOs are. I think that if we do that then we will see a lot more support for them. I really do not understand why so many people are against GMOs. We have been genetically modifying crops for thousands of years and GMOs are really just the next step in that process. The most important thing we can do is to make sure that people are educated on what GMOs are. We need to make sure that people understand how they work and why they are safe to eat. GMOs are completely safe. The only reason that people are afraid of them is because they do not understand what they are. I think that the biggest problem with GMOs is that they are not being used enough. There are so many places around the world that are not using them and are facing a severe food shortage. It is unfortunate that GMOs are so controversial because they are actually one of the safest and most environmentally friendly ways to grow food. I really think that the biggest problem with GMOs is that they are not being used enough. People are so afraid of GMOs because they do not understand what they are. I think that the biggest problem we face with GMOs is that people do not understand what they are. I think that the biggest problem we face with GMOs is that people do not understand what they are."

OpenAI,cmv-25,"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being devoted to the conservation of pandas, and while it's important to protect endangered species, some argue that the amount of money and effort put into protecting pandas could be better spent on conservation efforts that would have a greater impact on ecological diversity. However, it's also important to acknowledge the cultural and symbolic significance of pandas. In China, pandas have long been a national symbol and are highly valued. Additionally, pandas attract a lot of tourism, which brings economic benefits to the areas where they live. Ultimately, it's a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. It's up to individual countries and organizations to prioritize their conservation efforts and allocate their resources accordingly."
BigScience,cmv-25,"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being brought towards a state of extinction because humans want them to live longer. Therefore, it would be best if people began planting less trees. Instead, cut down the logging needs on certain areas where there isn't as much demand for timber. The same goes with livestock farming in particular beef cattle ranching has caused an immense amount of damage to wildlife by creating large herds which leads to overcrowding in their habitats causing many animals to die from starvation or disease (I guess this will take time). Lastly, I'm not sure whether you can save every single animal but I'd say don't buy any toys made using endangered animal parts such as horns, ivory etc. Buy more things made out of recycled material instead. (In my opinion) All these issues have been happening since almost forever so why do our governments just tell us what to do? It seems like there's no good reason other than profit motives. A: Let's look at each issue separately: Tree Planting: The main driver behind tree planting programs is one of economic benefit. Trees provide lots of services to society, including carbon sequestration - storing atmospheric CO2 when it's trapped inside the trunk root system. This is important because human emissions cause severe global warming across all continents. (There was even some concern about how useful that service might be until recently.) But one thing that's often overlooked: Increasing the density of forests tends to reduce storm activity, probably due to increased soil moisture retention, and therefore reduces flooding potential for downstream cities and communities. Using up land also decreases opportunities for future agriculture or urban development...so tree plantings aren't done lightly! LoggingRanching: A major impact of large-scale beef production is the loss of habitat for native species, both wild and domesticated, thus decreasing biodiversity. Given enough population growth, coupled with changes in climate patterns, this could lead to inevitable extinctions of local varieties. But especially worrying now is the threat posed by introduced predators whose numbers vastly exceed those of indigenous competitors particularly foxes. Native cervids suffer battery; moose populations decline drastically while coyotefoxhuman collusions drive ptarmigan into total extinction regions around Yellowstone National Park... Threats from invasive pests: Invasive species pose threats to agricultural yields; forest productivity; ecosystem health; ecological functioning; water quality; food security; and cultural heritage. (source) Toys: Toy manufacturers should use sourced materials whenever possible. This is something else we've seen before, namely bribery schemes involving companies who declare themselves ""ethical"" to get governmental subsidies. Bribery: There's still 16 billion awarded annually under Section283 contracts - 8 billion to U.S. public officials and 8 billion to foreign government officials - without bidding and linked only loosely to performance. The PBC report said money may remain unused unless Congress passes strict rules on how to award 3 trillion worth of federal spending going through Department of Defense procurement agencies during 2012-14.... If lawmakers don't act soon, contractors may see even greater losses, according to critics.... Just ask the Toyota fiasco: The firm's insistence on complying even after it had breached labor laws resulted in its exit from China altogether. That led to layoffs here in Japan - and angry drivers took to the streets of Kioto on Friday demanding the company return home. Source: Bureau of Investigative Journalism, ""Congress Should Cut Off Government Contractor Bribes,"" GovTrack Blog, 2 April 2013 (this article mentions the PBC scandal too) And remember buying organic produce? One study found strong evidence that pesticides were significantly lower compared to conventionally grown crops, although long-term studies would seem to show otherwise... Pesticides... used once per year showed differences between conventional and organically farmed fruit: average residue levels of herbicides varied by order of magnitude depending on crop type. For example, most fruits tested contained trace quantities of glyphosate residues of below 10 ngkg (the lowest detection limit), whereas vegetables collected directly from the field did not contain detectable amounts.... Fertilizers... On average, fertilizer application rates differed between the two groups by a factor of 3:1. Organic farmers applied approximately 10 higher nitrogen rates and 18 higher phosphorous rates than standard growers. Because of these increases, measured concentrations of N and P tended to be 5 times higher among organic crops relative to regularly treated controls.

So, it is time to stop spending those resources on them and let them die off and their habitat be repurposed for another species. Yes, we should let pandas die out. I don't think it's worth the time and effort to try to preserve pandas. If you look at it from an evolutionary perspective, the panda is a failure.

Were the 2014 Winter Olympics a success? Is the University of Connecticut women's basketball team the best ever? Should there be an Olympics every year? Does the United States need the World Cup? Should children be allowed to play tackle football? Do the Olympics help the host country's economy? Do you believe the NBA season should be longer?"
Human,cmv-25,"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival. Here are the reasons I believe this: 1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China. While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live. 2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5 of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird. 3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species. 4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow."
PaLM,cmv-25,"First off, I like pandas. I think they are cute and interesting, but I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are spent trying to keep pandas from going extinct, and I don't think it's worth it. Here are a few reasons why I think we should let pandas go extinct:  Pandas are not endangered. They are classified as vulnerable, which means they are at risk of extinction, but not immediately.  Pandas are not a keystone species. They do not play a vital role in the ecosystem, and their extinction would not have a major impact on other species.  Pandas are not a good investment. The amount of money spent on panda conservation could be better spent on other conservation efforts that have a greater chance of success. Here are some of the benefits of letting pandas go extinct:  We would save money. The money that is currently spent on panda conservation could be used for other conservation efforts that have a greater chance of success.  We would reduce human-wildlife conflict. Pandas live in areas that are also home to humans, and this can lead to conflict between the two species. If pandas go extinct, this conflict would be reduced.  We would free up resources. The resources that are currently being used to conserve pandas could be used for other purposes, such as research or education. I know that some people will disagree with me, but I believe that letting pandas go extinct is the best thing for the species and for the planet."

Many valuable resources are lost every day to the destruction of wild animals by hunting them for food or their hidesfur etc... What's worse than losing a perfectly good animal? Taking one away from nature so it can be raised in captivity forever! That means taking something out (or killing) an otherwise healthy individual just because some idiot wants its hide as decoration on his wall at home instead if using ""natural"" materials found nearby?! To me this makes no sense whatsoever - these people have absolutely nothing better going our about life then how many trophies did you get today?? For example: Lets say someone hunted down 10 lions last week.........and he got 9 kills......how special does THAT make him??? Especially since HE killed those innocent creatures with HIS OWN HANDS!! Does anyone really care what kind person has more trophys hanging up around there house???? NO!!!! But lets face facts here......50 percenters will go after anything humanely possible during hunts!!! As longas all rules laws regulations were followed before hand including permits ect. (hunting party included) these idiots feel justified enough nowt take such hard-earned wildlife material over any other humans possessions simply becuase THEY decided which ones looked best where!!!!!!!!! We don't need anymore examples but thats exactly why our country treasures appear daily being destroyed due too ignorance within ourselves.It takes real courage not only physically into doing harm against another living creature,but also having compassion develop your own self first (you know who i'm talking aboout). Yep most hunters do work very arduously throughout thier lives yet never raise children themselves........so again when asked whats wrong wth raising domestic livestock? Well................they didn'T grow insightfully right alongside us LOL Bye bye zoo baby 1??"

PaLM,cmv-26,"First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from all sides. There are a few reasons why someone might park in a handicap spot without a placard. One possibility is that they are in a hurry and don't want to have to walk far. Another possibility is that they are not aware that they need a placard to park in a handicap spot. And finally, it is possible that they are simply inconsiderate and don't care about the rules. If someone parks in a handicap spot without a placard, they are not only breaking the law, but they are also creating a problem for people with disabilities. Handicap spots are reserved for people who need them, and by taking up a spot without a placard, you are making it more difficult for people with disabilities to get around. If you see someone parking in a handicap spot without a placard, you can do a few things. First, you can try to talk to the person and explain that they need a placard to park in that spot. If that doesn't work, you can call the police or the parking authority. It is important to remember that people with disabilities face a number of challenges every day. By parking in a handicap spot without a placard, you are making it even harder for them to get around. Please be considerate and only park in handicap spots if you have a placard."

If you are only concerned about mass transit then why can't we just build more railbuses? Why does everyone have cars if they aren;'y using them right now anyway - isn there any sense that our city could actually become walkable without forcing its residents into car dependency over night! That would cost money yes but it seems like one way or another spending will need some consideration when growing outwards again so maybe let us spend on making public transportation better instead?"""

I didn't feel it was appropriate to discuss the douchiness of it there so I decided to make this post. You go into a parking lot and are trying to find a place to park. There's one 15 spots away from the door and then there's one that's 3 spots away from the door. One of them is meant for expectant mothers but there is no punishment for parking there if you are not an expectant mother which makes the two spots equivalent in everything expect for distance from the door. Objectively, it's better to choose the closer one. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

LLAMA,cmv-26,"First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a ""what if"" perspective. What is the limit you would go to in order to secure a close parking spot at the mall? Assume you are going to be there for a couple of hours, have a lot of packages, and maybe it's raining. When I was in middle school, I remember a person in my class had their parent drive them to school every day. I think they were going to school on crutches and couldn't walk far. Their parent would park in a handicapped spot. They would then go into the school, drop off the student, and leave. When I asked why they didn't get a handicapped pass for the student, they said it was too much trouble. So they would just use a handicapped spot instead of walking further from the other parking spots. We all know that the shortest route between two points is a straight line. Why is this? The earth is a sphere. Thus, the shortest route between two points is actually a curved line (an arc) which would match the curvature of the sphere. Thus, the shortest route between two points would be to go ""around"" the earth. I'm sure if you took a couple of minutes, you could easily figure out what the next number is. The only problem is, you will never be able to figure out what the next number is. This is an unsolved problem in math. In fact, there is a 1,000,000 prize if you can figure it out."

Regarding driver behavior: In my opinion such a policy could cause drivers to simply drive slower on these roads than they otherwise would and that may be just as unintended but no less annoying. As long as it makes sense to make people pay more traffic tickets or fines (which have been proven by history not work), then why cant we take advantage of that money and use it in education campaigns? I used to live near Riverside Park and loved driving there 20 years ago when gas was 3 - 4 per gallon! Now it's 8.50. The city had some very nice projects done with funds raised through those taxes like constructing bike lanes and seating where you can sit while eating your lunch outdoors. I've wondered if new cars are going to get an improvement in fuel economy over time due to improved electronic systems? Or maybe manufacturers will try to compensate for higher prices selling us better vehicles which deplete our petroleum reserves faster once we buy them? (Or both?) If so, I'm glad we're getting rid of the old cars sooner rather than later; I'm afraid we'll see much worse conditions around here soon..."
Tsinghua,cmv-26,"First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a different perspective. As for why it's good, I can't say for sure. I can say that I think this would increase the percentage of people who do walk to work. If more people do walk to work, that would in turn increase the amount of pedestrian traffic, which would make it safer to walk to work. But there's no hard data to back up this argument. What is this a good idea? Maybe it's a good idea because people would actually be willing to walk to work. This might not be the case because the lack of parking would make it more expensive to drive to work, and people would then be forced to choose between driving and walking. I can't say for sure. Maybe the lack of parking would be such a big deal that people would still drive even if they didn't have to. Maybe it's a good idea because people would actually be willing to walk to work.

But what if a similar problem existed in real life? I can't think of a real life example, but I think the point stands. We don't know for sure if this is a good idea. The first step in figuring this out is to find out how much it would cost to have parking. We need to have this answer in order to know how much people would be willing to pay to avoid having to drive to work. It's a good question to ask, and I'm glad someone else asked it. It's important to have a good understanding of the issue. I think that this is a good idea.

As in they're not going to have much sex with you; they will probably say ""ohh you're cute"" but if you enter into any kind of physical contact at all then it's gonna be awkward because it's known as cross-dressing (not always). The three examples above are just minor ones. In short though, yes sexuality does matter to people. Sex doesn't even mean genital intercourse anymore so how can we give those things away? If you don't want your partner to know what you're up too why do you keep them around? I thought readers knew these basic facts but obviously some people hadn't heard of anything called female-to-male gender conversion before this post. (And another one where men go through the male-to-female process) It's important to note that transgendered individuals may use different terms to describe themselves based off their personal experiences whether that's coming-out-ideology or social acceptance. This is similar to classifying a group by its appearance like skin color or hair style instead of asking questions such as: How did you become interested in astronomy? (in order to determine backgrounds). To sum it up nothing changes except society generally expects us to conform so most time our choices won't really affect anyone else beyond ourselves so there's no reason to worry about it Thanks for reading. Let me challenge my own views here... What happens after marriage between two heterosexual couples has come under scrutiny lately. Some primary studies show negative effects including divorce rates increasing and depression levels rising amongst gaylesbian couples. Even among same-sex partners, the higher income level was associated with more likely divorce than less wealthy couples. So is it really worth divorcing due to Catholic social teaching? Do you think Jesus' teachings should take precedence over human rights? Thank you. Yes I definitely agree that homosexual relationships could make it harder to find love versus traditional marriages which show an open door policy towards other singles seeking romantic relationship opportunities. Being religious for sure might help alleviate conflicts within one's own family members etc. It's certainly better to put God first however bringing pressure down onto yourself cannot necessarily fix everything! Wow thank you for writing this article. I've been struggling recently trying to decide how best to handle this situation. My boyfriend is originally Christian until he met me last year when he decided to become Muslim. Our church told him to cut ties to his old friends stop attending Mass. He came to US with 1 suitcase full of clothing left behind 7 years of clothing shoes. After having said prayers prior to every meal together, then each of us goes out buys whatever we feel comfortable wearing at the barsrestaurants around town.. We never sit in front of TV nor listen to music together during dinner times only talk.. once per week we pray collectively. Always mention Allah Ar-Rahman Rasoolallaah upon waking up sleeping at night. I am extremely stressed everyday wondering how long will this proceed. Also fearing thought rape suicide attempts by numerous acquaintances whenever I'm alone outside the house. No further plans at home unless invited, me feeling trapped inside apartment 247 And now also worried heshe started getting frustrated cooking cleaning I must admit I've taken pride knowing she didn't cook meals at home since losing her appetite days ago. Please send me positive thoughts guidance as soon as possible. The issue would be figuring out exactly what gets done regarding religion vs general secularism - political correctness - equality issues etc... Lets assume everyone follows their faith without taking advantage of others i guess ... But lets say, somehow, aliens invade and capture earth putting control back into hands of proper believers.. Wouldin allow homosexuals and women the chance to marry legally? In hypotheticals like these.. celebrating Christmas becomes forbidden??? Crying usually comes from either lack of support or stress. Maybe try using self-care techniques and meditation. You can read more here:"

OpenAI,cmv-29,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is considered a serious crime and is commonly known as rape or sexual assault. It is important to understand that someone cannot give their consent to sexual activities if they are being coerced, threatened, drugged or unable to communicate their wishes clearly. Consent needs to be freely given, enthusiastic, and ongoing throughout any sexual activity. It is important to respect someone's boundaries and understand that it is never okay to force someone to do something they don't want to do, particularly when it comes to intimate activities. Furthermore, it is important to speak out against these types of behaviors and support those who have experienced sexual violence."
Tsinghua,cmv-29,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they're drunk, unconscious, or otherwise not in full control of their faculties is illegal. The implication is that the person is not really in full control of their own body. But that's not the same thing as saying that the person is not in control of their own mind. A person can be drunk, and they can still be in control of their mind. The only reason that we're making an exception to this rule for sexual situations is because it's easier to see a violation when a person is in the physical control of someone else. This is similar to when you say, ""She's my girlfriend, so I'm allowed to hit her."" This is just another example of the same thing. It's easier to see a violation when the person is in the physical control of someone else. The reason that we don't let rapists go free is because it's easier to see a violation when the person is in the physical control of someone else. I don't think that this argument makes sense, but I don't see any other argument to support the idea that rape isn't a violation of body autonomy. In this situation, the rapist is violating the victim's body autonomy. They're taking away the victim's control of their own body. That's the violation. They are not taking away the victim's control of their mind. The rapist doesn't control the victim's mind. The victim controls their mind. The rapist is not a mind-controlling entity. They're just a rapist. They're not a mind-controlling entity. They're just a rapist. This seems like an extremely dangerous idea. If it's okay for someone to violate your body autonomy, then it's okay for them to violate your mind autonomy as well. It's okay for them to violate your moral autonomy as well.

BigScience,cmv-29,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want it or against their will can be considered a criminal offense under state and federal laws. In the United States today, people are being prosecuted for having sex with someone who does not consent. The main issue in these cases (1) is whether there was force; (2) what type of sexual conduct occurred, i.e., rape or simple sexual assault; and (3) did the victim knowingly enter into this relationship? It appears increasingly clear that all states now recognize consensual same-sex relationships as valid marriages between legally married couples. Accordingly, many courts are interpreting statutes such as s. 14 (b) (6) (4), which prohibits rape within those intimate carnal relations but allows them if the words ""coitus interruptus"" were used by either party. However, some juries do not seem convinced of this analysis -that a 'gay' couple cannot form an agreement outside of marriage. These court decisions appear to view any'marriage-like' arrangement involving two adults equally without regard to gender identity: Lopez v. Lopez [2000] NJ App Div 358 (3d Dept). The appellant claimed he had been sexually assaulted while on duty at his employer and sued his former boss claiming retaliation because her husband knew about the abuse. She argued that she only agreed to marry him after finding out about his background. However, since he was already engaged with an unmarried woman, there could be no legal basis for choosing which man would complete a wedding ceremony upon his death. Such reasoning ignores clearly established law regarding standing... Such precedent emphasizes the importance of context. It also reminds us that: ""The appeal must rest on either transcendent principles resting outside the scope of rulemaking or relevant findings flowing from the record."" While most lawyers agree on the basic elements required by reason and logic, each case should be analyzed individually, considering the facts surrounding it and how such factors may influence the outcome. A: I think you've gotten your answer here. There isn't really anything wrong with gay ""marriages,"" although I suppose if you live in the country where bigots are allowed to get away with discriminating based on differences, then you're going to find yourself somewhat isolated. The problem comes when speakers use ""spouses"" or ""wiveswidowsetc.) interchangeably with ""matrimony"" the word invites misunderstanding and connotations often beyond its intended meaning. When using the term spouse, one has full responsibility over one's actions, mental health, etc.. This aspect is crucially important to understand. Because you're talking about language usage rather than actual social interactions, I'm assuming you'd like me to address just the latter. (Don't hesitate to edit my answer to include other aspects.) Some cultures and traditions consider homosexuality sinful. Some religions emphasize purity of spirit even more so than piety; thus, members of those groups tend to avoid certain terms, including those associated with promiscuity: Likewise, societies whose culture considers heterosexuality superior ignore terms connected to it. (Also note that it's impossible to describe everything that's appropriate for all situations...) As a result of these cultural preferences, you'll sometimes hear jokes that suggest men preferring women are simply confused about how things work. Why? Because human beings evolved as males. A: To expand on brian's excellent answer: Not everyone understands ""gay"" as equal to ""homosexuality."" And probably not everyone knows ""the correct way to say 'he is a male'."" It's easy enough to explain why ""person X"" means ""X is female,"" but explaining ""gay"" doesn't help much unless ""Person X is male"" sounds bad too. Being called ""female"" is usually very commonplace, and there aren't always lots of alternatives around. Being called ""Mr.MrsSir MissMissy"" is pretty rare thougheven less so being called ""Mr"" when you're youngand there's nothing particularly negative about calling a person ""Uncle Us,"" ""Auntie,"" ""Guy OGGirl O'G,"" ""Brother-in-lawBest friend,"" ""Sister-in-lawFather-of-Last-child,"" ""Dad"" or ""Father"" again... My future wife is a lesbian (so far). We met online through Bumble before starting dating. So far she's never asked me to change my name, nor has she ever said ""I wish it wasn't necessary to call you Mr. Smith."" She's referred to herself by first names whenever we've talked face-to-face, and I've seen plenty of examples of other friends doing likewise. (There's only once where I see a man's name mentioned during conversation). She told me recently something along the lines of: ""It's nice to talk with a guy named John. I haven't done that much with girls. There's a lot of pressure to fit in somewhere else. If it's okay we might try to move our date up a few days to make it easier. But if it's right they won't mind waiting for us."""
LLAMA,cmv-29,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is considered a severe crime. Why, then, is forced sex of any sort acceptable? Why is it OK to force another to have sex they do not want to? I'm not talking about sex between partners, whether married or not. I'm talking about forced sex of any kind, even the kind where the victim is expected to just go along with it. It is not OK to force another to have sex they do not want to. It doesn't matter if the other person is married to the victim or not. It doesn't matter if they are in a committed relationship. It doesn't matter if they are dating. It doesn't matter if they are friends. It doesn't matter if they are family. It doesn't matter if they are total strangers. If you are expecting a person to have sex with you when they do not want to, you are forcing that person to have sex. And that is not OK. Labels: rape, responsibility, sex, society ""If you are expecting a person to have sex with you when they do not want to, you are forcing that person to have sex. And that is not OK."" I agree, but what I'm still unclear on is how you define ""forcing."" You said in another post, ""Incidentally, I do not consider forcing to be as severe as rape, but it is still a violation of the victim's right to autonomy."" So, what do you consider ""forcing""? Under the law, there are two things that are considered rape. One is the typical one where the perpetrator physically forces the victim to have sex. The other is where the victim is unable to give consent (underage, intoxicated, mentally ill, etc.). I consider the second one to be rape, but I do not consider it to be as severe as the first kind. The reason is that the first kind is something that the perpetrator chose to do, while the second kind the perpetrator may not have even realized they were doing something wrong. Forcing is when the victim has made it clear that they do not want to have sex and the perpetrator ignores this and continues to expect sex from the victim. Sex isn't as simple as you make it sound. It's not just a yes or no thing. People are complicated creatures and sometimes it's not as simple as a yes or no thing. I can't believe how little you know about sex. You can always say no, no matter what. There are different ways to pressure someone into sex, or to give in to pressure, but saying no is always an option. Are you saying it isn't?

If you don't have anything to contribute to the discussion, then please stay out of it. You don't have any right to tell me what to do, Brian. ""The question I asked is for the author of the post. Not you."" I said that you can always say no, no matter what. It's a statement of fact. You think you can say no, no matter what?

No matter how much you're in love with someone, no matter how much you're turned on, no matter how much you know it will make someone else happy? No matter how much you've already agreed to do it? And you think that's the end of the conversation? ""You think you can say no, no matter what?"" Yes, no matter what. You can say no no matter what.

Human,cmv-29,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it should be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. So, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians. Edit 1: Okay uscottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, I changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping I still believe that I could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug. Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music I like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love] one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural] . That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this] . REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain. Edit 3: uglory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take I guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain.

I understand your opinion, but at the same time, rapping goes beyond just saying words over a beat. It requires skill, technique, and creativity. Many rappers spend years perfecting their craft and developing their own unique style. Additionally, some rap lyrics may not make sense at first, but they can often hold deeper meaning or be a commentary on society. Like any art form, there are some who are more skilled and talented than others, but that doesn't mean the entire genre lacks talent."

The most important thing about rap music, is that the lyrics flow well together and have purpose. The rapper creates an emotional connection between his listeners and their own personal experiences. Rap's influence on our society has been controversial since its inception; however it has grown in popularity significantly with time as more people become aware of how powerful this genre truly is. Rap users represent many different racial groups around the world but all share one common goal: getting heard by those who would listen!

They just repeat the same words over and over again. But there are many talented rappers out there who are able to tell stories, paint pictures with their words, and make you feel something. They have a gift for using words in a way that is both creative and meaningful. Here are a few examples of talented rappers:  Jay-Z is one of the most successful rappers of all time.

Some countries pride themselves on having some fascinating culture and history but really struggle economically nowadays (like Japan). Learning their language will help provide further insight into what makes them tick as well as giving some background knowledge for those who want to travel there. Suppose you've just finished university and do not know where your next career move might be? What could possibly boost self-esteem better than knowing another country's currency?

PaLM,cmv-31,"If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean has several advantages over learning European languages.  Economic. China is the world's second largest economy, and Japan and South Korea are both major economic powers. Knowing these languages will give you a significant advantage in international business.  Cultural. East Asian cultures are very different from Western cultures, and learning their languages will give you a deeper understanding of these cultures. This can be a valuable asset in any career, but it is especially important for those who work in international business or diplomacy.  Academic. East Asian languages are very challenging to learn, but they are also very rewarding. Studying these languages will improve your critical thinking skills and your ability to learn other languages.  Personal. Learning an East Asian language can be a very rewarding personal experience. It will open up a whole new world of literature, film, music, and cuisine. It will also give you the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. Of course, there are also some disadvantages to learning an East Asian language. These languages are very difficult to learn, and it can take years to become fluent. There are also fewer resources available for learning East Asian languages than there are for European languages. Overall, the advantages of learning an East Asian language outweigh the disadvantages. If you are interested in doing business in Asia, learning an East Asian language is a must. If you are interested in learning about other cultures, learning an East Asian language is a great way to do it. And if you are simply looking for a challenge, learning an East Asian language is one of the most challenging and rewarding things you can do. Here are some specific reasons why you might want to learn Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, or Korean:  Mandarin Chinese is the most widely spoken language in the world, with over 1 billion speakers. It is the official language of China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Knowing Mandarin Chinese will give you a huge advantage in international business, as well as in travel and tourism.  Japanese is the official language of Japan and is spoken by over 120 million people. It is a major economic power, and knowing Japanese will give you a significant advantage in international business. Japanese is also a very beautiful language, with a rich literary and cultural tradition.  Korean is the official language of South Korea and is spoken by over 70 million people. It is a major economic power, and knowing Korean will give you a significant advantage in international business. Korean is also a very interesting language, with a unique writing system and a rich cultural tradition."

You can do it by going to a country where that language is spoken (the best way, in my opinion), going to language school, or just immersing yourself in the culture by watching TV shows, reading books and interacting with people who speak the language. As for the language itself, each language is different, and each is difficult in its own way. For me, I felt that Chinese was the most difficult language to learn, because it is a tonal language. I had to train myself to pronounce the tones correctly, and it was the first language I learned where the writing system was completely different from English. Japanese was difficult for me as well, because it also has three scripts. Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji are each different, and there are thousands of Kanji to memorize.

My question is how do I make it in Japan and become famous? I think the best way to do that would be to move to Japan. Then learn the language and audition for talent agencies. This is an interesting question. I think it is more common in Asian countries to have English names. I believe this is because the Japanese language does not have words for many Western names. Therefore, people in Japan are not able to pronounce many Western names, and so they use English names. I also think it makes it easier to communicate with other people who don't speak Japanese. For example, if I were to go to Japan, I would probably be called David-san instead of my Japanese name, which would be . It is important to note that many people in Japan do have Japanese names. I had a friend who was half Japanese, half American. He had a Japanese name, . He also had an English name, which was Brian. Interestingly enough, most people in Asian countries do not have a middle name. I don't know why this is, but in America it is very common to have one. Thank you for the great question.

Human,cmv-31,"If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language. -Travel It's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English. Most Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words. You can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language. I don't consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers. -Media When it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. Specifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power] , and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country. -Availability European languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English. For an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world. East Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.] -Difficulty East Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki. A lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is ""logical"" and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). If you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither. -Cultural benefits It's almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours. Learning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. European cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.

PaLM,cmv-32,"I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100% sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of stories about police brutality and misconduct. On the one hand, I know that the vast majority of police officers are good people who are just trying to do their jobs. They put their lives on the line every day to protect us, and I'm grateful for their service. On the other hand, it's hard to ignore the fact that there are a significant number of police officers who abuse their power and use excessive force. These officers give the rest of law enforcement a bad name, and they make it harder for us to trust the police. I think the most important thing is to remember that not all police officers are bad. There are good cops out there who are doing their jobs honestly and ethically. We need to support these officers and encourage them to continue to serve our communities. We also need to hold the bad cops accountable for their actions. We need to make sure that they are punished for their crimes, and we need to make sure that they are not allowed to continue to work in law enforcement. It's a difficult situation, but I think we can find a way to address the problem of police brutality and misconduct without demonizing all police officers. We need to have a nuanced conversation about this issue, and we need to be willing to hold both sides accountable. Here are some specific things that we can do to address the problem of police brutality and misconduct:  We need to improve police training. Officers need to be trained to de-escalate situations rather than using force. They also need to be trained to treat people of color with respect.  We need to create independent civilian oversight boards to investigate police misconduct. These boards should have the power to investigate complaints against police officers and to recommend disciplinary action.  We need to make sure that police officers are held accountable for their actions. When officers are found to have used excessive force or violated the law, they should be punished accordingly. I believe that these are just some of the things that we can do to address the problem of police brutality and misconduct. It's a complex issue, but I think we can find a way to make our communities safer without demonizing all police officers. In the meantime, I will continue to support the good cops out there who are doing their jobs honestly and ethically. I will also continue to hold the bad cops accountable for their actions.

There are many different types of body cameras from very basic ones most likely similar in cost (or less) than some cell phone camera upgrades that can be purchased at any hardware store or online retailer; there are more expensive professional grade dash cams including those used for recording traffic violations such as speeding tickets; there are also GPS units worn around one's neck that record everything ever said andor sent via text message. These devices offer a number of benefits over standard hand held cell phones: they appear to provide much better resolution imagesrecordings (including night vision imagery), do not take up valuable space inside a car nor require drivers to carry them around; allow the driver to detect potential road hazards earlier and thus avoid getting into accidents (which is obviously important given the current safety concerns in our auto insurance industry). They may be able to assist investigators in determining whether illegal activity was involved without endangering anyone's life. Even though these devices are being promoted heavily right now as state legislators work through proposed laws regarding body camera usage, there's no evidence that driving while wearing a device enhances vehicle safety overall."

I want to live in a world where if you make the decision to shoot and kill someone there should be a good reason. In the case of Walter Scott being shot in the back by Officer Michael Slager there was no reason. I want to live in a world where the police are there to protect and serve the citizens. This is not to say that I am against the police. I am just against police that act outside of their authority. This seems to be a problem that the police are having as of late and it really isn't helping their image. I like to think that I have a good relationship with the police that I have had dealings with. As a matter of fact, when I was in college I got caught for underage drinking. The officer that came and got me was one of the nicest guys that I have met. He simply told me I was underage and I wasn't supposed to have that beer. He asked me to pour it out and I did. He asked me if I wanted to call someone to come and get me. He also told me that he hoped he didn't have to see me again because that was my one shot. I appreciated his honesty and openness. I want to live in a world where all officers act like that. It's a good thing that most officers do act like that. The problem is that it is the few that act outside of their authority that are ruining it for the rest of them. I want to live in a world where a cop doesn't shoot someone in the back. I want to live in a world where a cop doesn't put a man in a choke hold for allegedly selling single cigarettes. I want to live in a world where if a man is shot in the back, the officer is arrested and put on trial for murder. I want to live in a world where a cop is arrested and put on trial for killing a man in a choke hold. I don't think I'm asking for much. I don't think that it should be an unreasonable request. I think that it should be the standard for a civilized society. I'm not advocating a riot. I'm advocating that the police take steps to clean up their act. In the wake of the Walter Scott shooting, the Charleston Police Department is having all officers wear body cameras. This is a good thing. In the case of Walter Scott, it was the video that led to Officer Michael Slager being arrested and charged with murder. This is a good thing. I have to admit that I don't have all the answers. I don't think anyone does. I would love to be able to say that the only people that should be armed are the police but I know that is unrealistic. I think that we need to do more to protect our police but I know that is unrealistic. I think that we need to put more emphasis on training for the police but I know that is unrealistic. So what can we do? I don't have an answer for that either. I know that we need to do something but I just don't know what. Labels: police, society I wish I had something to say to make this better. But I don't. It's a mess. The only thing that can be done is to pray for the family of the victims, and to pray for the policemen who are caught up in this.

Like I said before, I'm not a cop hater. I just don't like the disproportionate amount of attention and negative news they receive. That said, it's hard to really feel bad for them because it's like they get shot on a daily basis and they're just going about their daily lives. Cops get shot 5 times more than anyone else and they're expected to carry out their jobs and keep people safe without any physical harm. I think they should be protected and should get the respect that they deserve, but the constant negative attention that they receive is ridiculous.

If you wish to challenge the police officer's legal right to do something, the proper venue is in Court and not in the street. and my reply That's horse-shit buddy Despite the sheer magnitude of the amount of recent cases of police blatantly abusing their power with zero retribution I am still of the opinion that most officers are genuinely decent people. But like any other human, they carry inclinations for benevolence AND iniquity. Honest intentions sadly don't always equal righteous actions and authority must be challenged. Always. Full stop. I'm not some edgy teenage anarchist. The police work for the public. They need to constantly be held accountable and should never be beyond reproach You say the proper venue to challenge the police's legal right to do something is in the courts; I say the proper venue is any and everywhere.

EDIT: It's been pointed out that my title is shitty and misleading. I'll restate my position better but as of now I no longer hold that view specifically. Cops have authority. I fully support that. I believe it's necessary for a society to function for there to be people to enforce the law by means greater than what the average citizen should be allowed. I also believe those enforcers should be held to a higher moral standard. That they should not violate the reach of the powers we give them. And that if they do, we, the very people that gave them the power in the first place, have our own duty to not allow it despite such disobedience being an often unsafe and likely consequential undertaking. Might doesn't make right. I definitely don't want to get my ass beat andor thrown in jail for pissing off the wrong cop by not letting him violate my rights and despite my position I don't know if I would have the courage in the moment to stand up to a weaponized bully but I do know it would be the right thing to do. Maybe not the smart thing, but the right thing. I'm not saying to go around saying the fuck the police and disobeying them for no reason. I'm saying only show deference when they are acting appropriately."
OpenAI,cmv-33,"Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as a mediocre pizza from a restaurant. However, there are some ways to improve the quality of frozen pizza. One way is to add additional toppings or ingredients to the pizza, such as vegetables or meats. Another way is to cook the pizza in a hot oven at a higher temperature than recommended on the package, which can help it cook more evenly and produce a crisper crust. It's also important to make sure the pizza is fully thawed before cooking to ensure even cooking. While frozen pizza may never compare to a freshly made pizza from a restaurant, these tips can help make it a more enjoyable and satisfying meal."
Human,cmv-33,"Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant. I have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail. I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese. What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, terrible crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail. I understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015."

In New York, restaurant pizza costs 8 to 10, which is about 1 to 2 less than you'll pay for a frozen pizza. And this price gap is wider in the United States, where the cost of restaurant pizza ranges from 10 to 20, compared to 8 to 15 for frozen pizza. Frozen pizza has become the most common food in America, so we're really talking about a 40 to 50 price difference. Even though restaurant pizza is less expensive, there's a huge difference in quality.

There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as a good pizzeria pie. So it's always a pleasant surprise when I discover a frozen pizza that's not just edible, but actually pretty darn good. Which is what I found in the new DiGiorno pizza from Nestle, an adaptation of the thin-crust pizza that's served at California Pizza Kitchen. DiGiorno, which has been turning out frozen pizzas for years, recently branched into thin-crust pizza. The thin-crust pies are available in four varieties: Five Cheese; Spinach, Tomato Garlic; BBQ Recipe Chicken; and Mushroom, Spinach Garlic. A 10-inch pie ranges in price from 7.99 to 8.99, depending on the flavor. The Spinach, Tomato Garlic flavor has the lowest calorie count, with 350 per slice; the Five Cheese has 420 calories per slice. I tried the Five Cheese and Spinach, Tomato Garlic, and the latter was my favorite. The crust is thin, but not so thin that it's brittle. The toppings, though sparse, are flavorful. The sauce is a bit thin and watery, but it's the same way at California Pizza Kitchen. If you like thin-crust pizza, you'll enjoy this. And I certainly would never suggest that it's better than a pizzeria pie. But it's the best frozen pizza I've had in years. A survey of the seafood counter at the Publix in Lake Mary revealed a wide variety of fresh seafood, including a nice selection of freshly shucked oysters. In the raw bar section, you can choose from Gulf oysters, Apalachicola oysters, East Coast oysters and Kumamoto oysters. Each one is a different size and has a different flavor and texture. Some are brinier than others. The Apalachicola oysters were the smallest in size and the briniest of the lot. Publix has a handy chart to help you understand the differences between the varieties. The oysters are displayed in a refrigerated case and the shucker is right there. You select the variety and how many you want, then the shucker opens them for you, just as they would in a restaurant. The oysters are 79 cents apiece. I bought a dozen Kumamoto oysters, which were the most tender and sweetest in flavor. They're also the most expensive. I squeezed a bit of lemon juice on them and enjoyed them immediately. They were so tender that they needed no chewing; you just sort of let them slide down your throat. I guess that's why they're called Kiss-O-Matos, according to the Publix chart. I've never been a big fan of oysters, but I was impressed by these and can see why people go to great lengths to get the freshest, most tender ones. If you like oysters, you'll love this. In addition to the oysters, there was a nice variety of fish and shellfish, including whole fish, scallops, mussels, clams, crabs and shrimp. Publix always has fresh seafood in the meat department, but this seafood bar was an extra treat. I have a feeling that this will be a nice spot for a drink and an appetizer when the new Ruth's Chris Steakhouse opens in the Mall at Millenia. That's because the area just outside the steakhouse is a beautifully landscaped patio area, with a fountain and a fireplace. It will be the perfect spot to enjoy a drink and a few nibbles from the bar menu before entering the formal atmosphere of the restaurant. There will be several types of seating, including a lounge area with upholstered furniture and a bar area with stools and high tables. There will also be tables with chairs. It looks like it will be a perfect spot for a quiet drink, perhaps a glass of wine or a cocktail, as well as a few appetizers from the"

There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn’t as good as the worst restaurant pizza. But there are a few reasons why people still buy frozen pizza. First, frozen pizza is convenient. It’s ready to eat in minutes, and you don’t have to worry about making a mess in the kitchen. Second, frozen pizza is affordable. A frozen pizza costs a fraction of what a restaurant pizza does. And third, frozen pizza is available everywhere. You can find it in grocery stores, convenience stores, and even gas stations. Of course, there are also some downsides to frozen pizza. It’s not as fresh as restaurant pizza, and it doesn’t taste as good. But for people who are looking for a quick, affordable, and convenient meal, frozen pizza is a good option. If you’re looking for a frozen pizza that’s actually worth eating, there are a few things you can look for. First, look for a pizza that has a high percentage of real cheese.

I've really enjoyed your article - I've got a vegan friend who has written an entire blog about her experiences with going vegetarian, what it's been like for her family, etc...and she's also had fun keeping up appearances while doing so! A quick note here on veganism too: Everyone is different, but there are definitely some things you should know if you're considering switching over entirely from all animal products of any kind It's good to hear you're inspired by someone else's initiative! Hopefully we will see more people fed-up with factory farming taking action themselves... Thanks for sharing these articles.

As soon as The Ritz-Carlton opened its doors back in August 2016, celebrities flocked to San Simeon Beach hoping to steal something away from billionaire Dan Stevens' 40 million beachfront mansion that overlooks Pacific Ocean shores. Former President Bill Clinton's spouse Hillary Rodham was one of them. She reportedly visited the venue after admiring the property and saying she wanted to come visit the lush tropical views that made it seem like paradise on earth. To give her what she wanted, hotel manager Andrew Portman offered her a room at his own five-star lodge. A few weeks later, he sent her flowers and cards thanking her for stopping by.

PaLM,cmv-34,"I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth and/or meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I should change my eating habits. I understand that some people have strong feelings about this issue, and I respect their right to choose not to eat meat. However, for me personally, the benefits of eating meat outweigh the risks. I enjoy the taste of meat, and I believe that it is an important part of a healthy diet. I also believe that humans have been eating meat for thousands of years, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is harmful to our health. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to eat meat is a personal one. There is no right or wrong answer. If you are concerned about the ethics or sustainability of meat production, there are many alternative options available to you. However, I believe that it is important to be informed about the facts before making a decision."

I think this is also partly because I grew up in a place where it was hard to eat local, organic, or even local. I'm not opposed to buying and eating local, but I think it is a very hard thing to do in the places I have lived and currently live. I think I would also feel differently about meat eating if I didn't have to pay for it. I feel that I am willing to pay for the better quality meat that I eat because I want it to be good for my health and the health of the animals that I am eating. However, I feel like if I am paying for the meat that I eat, I shouldn't have to pay for the gas that it took to get to the store, the 30 minutes of my time it took to get it home, the time and energy it took to make the food, and the money I am spending on groceries to buy the meat. As a result, I am not very interested in making the effort to try to reduce my meat consumption or to find ways to be vegetarian. In the future, I would like to be more aware of how much time and energy I am putting into my food, and how much of it is not going to the people and animals that I am eating. I do not know how I would feel about eating meat if I lived in a different part of the world or in a different country, because the quality of the meat would be different. I also think it would be different if I had to pay for the gas that it took to get to the store, the 30 minutes of my time it took to get it home, the time and energy it took to make the food, and the money I am spending on groceries to buy the meat. However, I do not think that these differences would make me feel any more or less about eating meat. I think that the main reason I am not interested in being vegetarian is that I don't feel like it is important enough to me to make the effort to be vegetarian. I do not feel that it has any deep meaning that I personally need to make an effort to change."

(diet) Pages: 2 (516 words) Published: May 26, 2013. However, there are other reasons to consider for the people who eat meat. It is ethically wrong to kill animals for food when you have other options.

But, if you dont eat meat, you are likely to lack essential nutrients, especially vitamin B12, which is only found in animal products. That, in turn, can lead to a host of problems. There are also some nutrients, such as calcium and zinc, that are easier for your body to absorb from meat than from plantbased sources. Without it, you can suffer from a lack of energy and strength. The second negative effect of eating meat is the way that the meat is prepared. Meat production uses a lot of energy, especially red meat. The resources required to feed animals are much higher than those required for plants. If you eat meat you are not doing your part to fight against global warming. On the other hand, eating meat is good for you because it is a source of protein. Protein is needed by our body to build and repair muscle tissue. This may be why meat is so good for athletes. Without it, they would not be able to build up their muscles as well. In conclusion, there are advantages and disadvantages of eating meat. Meat has nutrients that are essential for our body, and it also provides us with protein. If we eat a lot of meat, however, we may become sick because of the fat and bacteria it contains. Meat does have a lot of nutrients that are needed by our body, but it also contains fat and bacteria which can cause health problems.

I believe that eating meat is not bad for you. It is an important source of protein and nutrients, and it tastes good. There are some people who are vegetarians because they think eating meat is wrong, and others are vegetarians for religious reasons. Eating meat is a good thing because it provides us with a lot of nutrients. Meat is a good source of protein and other vitamins and minerals. It is important for our diet because our body needs the protein to build muscles and repair cells. Vegans and vegetarians are not getting enough protein and have to eat many different kinds of vegetables and grains to get the same amount of protein. There are many people who believe that meat is bad for you. It does have fat and bacteria, which can cause health problems, but we can avoid these problems by eating a healthy amount of meat.

OpenAI,cmv-34,"I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I shouldn't eat meat. However, it is important to recognize that there are valid concerns and arguments against meat consumption, and it is always worthwhile to educate ourselves on those issues. From a health standpoint, studies have shown that excessive consumption of red meat can increase the risk of certain health issues such as heart disease and cancer. This doesn't necessarily mean that we have to completely eliminate meat from our diets, but it is important to practice moderation and make sure we are getting a balanced diet. From an environmental standpoint, the meat industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. This can have major consequences for our planet and future generations, and it is important to consider the impact of our individual actions on a larger scale.

Human,cmv-35,"Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think that the only reason we don't define it as that is political correctness, combined with the stigma around mental illness. Transgender people don't want to be lumped in with other people with mental illnesses because there is a such a stigma against it. And if society starts treating transgender people as having no mental issue, and accepting invasive surgery as the standard treatment then that will slow research towards less drastic treatments. Ideally, in the future, if someone were to come into a doctor's office and say ""I feel so bad in my current body that I want hormonal treatment and invasive surgery"" the doctor would be able to prescribe something that would just make the transgender person no longer feel terrible in their current body.

LLAMA,cmv-35,"Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think many people, including myself, have wondered about what it would be like to be a different gender, or have wondered about what it would be like to have surgery, hormones, etc. What is it like to be transgender? If you're asking if you're transgender because you're questioning your own gender identity, we can't give you an answer on that. If you feel like you're a different gender than the one you're assigned at birth, and you're in the middle of questioning your gender identity, you're transgender. But don't worry! An individual's identity is unique to them and they may identify differently to different people at different times and in different situations. Questions to Ask Yourself:. If you are questioning your gender identity, it might be helpful to ask yourself the following questions. How do you feel about your body? Many people who are transgender have felt this way since early childhood, even before they were old enough to understand that feeling. Others may first experience gender dysphoria as they are going through puberty, when the sex hormones of the opposite sex begin to change their bodies. And some people begin to feel gender dysphoria later in life, as they face increasingly stressful circumstances and the realization that they are not able to live a happy life with their body as it is. Gender dysphoria is not a choice. What does it mean to be transgender? There are many different kinds of people in the world. One of the many things that makes us all different is our gender identity. Our gender identity is how we feel about our gender, whether we are a boy, a girl, or something else. Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression that differs from their assigned sex. Transgender people are sometimes called transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another. Transgender is also an umbrella term: in addition to including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex trans men and trans womenit may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine persons who are genderqueer or non-binary , including agender, bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or genderfuck individuals. Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender , or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender.

As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people. I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else. I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this . I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve. Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve). So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?"

LLAMA,cmv-36,"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of the older generations in my family. My grandmother, for instance, is a very very Catholic woman who doesn't believe in being gay and who is very judgmental of anyone who has a different sexuality. She thinks I am a woman and she will call me ""she"" even though I prefer male pronouns. I don't understand how someone who is so judgmental could have raised a son who is so loving and accepting of everyone. It's because of this difference in opinion that I'm scared to come out to my family. I haven't told them that I'm bisexual and I don't know if I ever will. I fear that if I do, it will cause problems. The majority of my family doesn't care about sexuality, but I know that my grandmother will be furious and will probably try to cut me out of the family. My mom doesn't care about my sexuality and has told me that she supports me, but she doesn't know that I am bisexual. If I come out to her, I'm afraid that she will tell my grandmother. But there are times when I just feel like coming out to my whole family. I feel like I'm lying to them and I just want to be myself. I want to be able to tell them about my crushes and how I feel about boys and girls. I want to be able to tell them about the girls I want to date and the boys I want to date. I feel like if I can tell them, I won't feel so stressed out about being secretive. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be so stressed out, but I don't want to come out and risk it all. I just don't know what to do. Hey there! So, this is a really tricky situation, and it is up to you to make this decision. But, if you do decide to come out, we've got some advice for you! Come out in writing. It can be really intimidating to come out to your family. It is, after all, a huge part of your identity and a big announcement to make. If you feel more comfortable, write a letter or an email to your family. In the letter, you can explain how you feel, and why you've decided to come out. That way, you can tell them everything you want to say. Come out with a friend. It may make you feel more confident to bring a friend with you. If you have a friend who is LGBTQ, they can help you out with this. It may make you feel more confident to have someone you trust with you. Make a game plan. If you are planning to come out, it's a good idea to make a game plan for what you will say. You can create a list of your feelings, or write down what you want to say to your family. It's a good idea to have a plan for if they don't react well. Some people don't react well to their family members coming out, and you may feel hurt. You can always call a trusted friend or the Trevor Project hotline if you need help. I hope this helped, and good luck! Nice job, you seem to have a good head on your shoulders and are handling this in a way that is good for you! My thoughts: Your feelings are absolutely valid, and it's good to feel them out, but I would be cautious about disclosing anything to your grandmother. She sounds like she would take it badly, and her response could be harmful to you. However, your mom sounds like she would be a wonderful support for you! If you want to tell her, I would. If you don't want to, that's okay too! You know what's best for you. I'm glad that your family is accepting and loving!"

Now, I can't say that for some of my friends because there are still more than enough people out there who don't understand the importance of celebrating diversity. I was raised to respect everyone's culture especially my own. (And by ""respect"" I'm not talking about intellectual curiosity or knowing enough facts.) I also remember being taught that we should be open-minded when it comes to other cultures. And while I've been exposed to different lifestyles from time-to-time here in America over the years, relatively speaking I've never really had much exposure outside Europe, Africa and Asia on a major scale until recently with a few trips back home. It's interesting to see the differences between living at both ends of this spectrum: One side is where you can build relationships through common interests like sports teams, clubs etc., but most interactions take place within your immediate circle; the other extreme is one where every day you're surrounded by complete strangers... and talk to them all the way down to their pet rat!"

Now, I can't say that for some of my friends who are part of the LGBTQ community. They have faced discrimination and struggles because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. As a supportive friend, what can I do to help them feel accepted and loved? There are several things that you can do as a supportive friend to show your LGBTQ friends that you love and accept them for who they are: 1. Listen to them - Sometimes the best way to support your friends is to just listen to them. Allow them to share their experiences with you, and offer a non-judgmental ear. 2. Educate yourself - Take some time to learn about the experiences of people within the LGBTQ community. This will help you to understand the unique challenges they face and give you a better perspective on how to be a supportive ally. 3. Use inclusive language - Make an effort to use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about people's sexual orientations. For example, instead of assuming that someone is attracted to the opposite gender, use terms like ""partner"" or ""significant other"" instead of ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend,"" etc. 4. Be an ally - Speak out when you hear someone making derogatory comments about the LGBTQ community. Stand up for your friends and advocate for their rights. 5. Celebrate diversity - Celebrate the diversity within the LGBTQ community by attending events like Pride festivals and parades. Show your support by wearing rainbow colors or other symbols of LGBTQ pride."
Human,cmv-37,"As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic. While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product. An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast. Unfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately. This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes. Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes. Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos. Raising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements. Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation. In addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back. Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control. On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle. Unfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them. The only viable solution as I see it would be not to tax food, but rather pants, say by 5-10 per inch the waistline is larger than the inseam. This would ensure that only the fat would have to pay fat taxes. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

LLAMA,cmv-37,"As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic. Indeed, food taxes are coming on the heels of what the World Health Organization calls an ""exploding"" obesity epidemic in developed countries. ""Worldwide, obesity has more than doubled since 1980,"" the World Health Organization reports. ""In 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight. Of these over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese."" In addition to being unhealthy, obesity is expensive. The WHO reports that ""the annual cost of obesity is estimated to be as high as US 200 billion in the United States and US 10 billion in Australia."" In light of this, many governments are seeing food taxes as a way to combat the problem. According to researchers at the University of Michigan, at least 31 countries have adopted food taxes. ""Denmark taxes foods high in saturated fats and those with more than 2.3 percent sugar or other sweeteners,"" the researchers reported. ""In Sweden, taxes are applied to certain foods, such as ice cream, chocolate, candy, soft drinks and sugary juice drinks. Finland has taxed sweets, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages and ice cream. The taxes in Finland and Sweden, however, were repealed due to public disapproval and cross-border shopping."" For example, in 2011, Denmark began taxing unhealthy foods, such as butter, cheese, pizza, meat, milk, and oil, according to the Daily Mail. According to the Danish Ministry of Taxation, foods high in saturated fats are taxed 16 Danish kroner (US 2.85) per kilogram, while foods with more than 2.3 sugar are taxed 14 Danish kroner (US 2.53) per kilogram. The money raised from these taxes is intended to fund healthcare initiatives. However, food companies have raised concerns over the taxes. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Kim Jensen, the CEO of Denmark's largest dairy company, Arla Foods, said: ""I am against the fat tax because it takes the focus off the real problems, which are too much sugar, salt, fat and too little exercise."" Others have argued that the taxes on foods are regressive and unfair. ""There are legitimate arguments for and against food taxes,"" the researchers at the University of Michigan said. ""On one hand, taxes raise prices, and price increases can lead to decreases in consumption of unhealthy foods. On the other hand, taxes are a regressive form of financing, and they disproportionately affect low-income populations. Taxes may also have unintended consequences, such as consumers substituting to untaxed high-calorie foods, which may lead to an overall increase in caloric consumption."" Food taxes also increase the cost of living, the Michigan researchers noted. They gave the example of Mexico, which implemented taxes on foods in 2013. ""The taxes are expected to generate 25 billion pesos [US 2 billion],"" they said. ""Food prices are expected to increase by as much as 10 percent because of the new taxes, and the price of sugar-sweetened beverages is expected to increase by 10 percent."" This could have a negative impact on the country's poor, as the Tax Foundation noted in an article. ""Low-income families spend a greater percentage of their income on food than high-income families,"" the Foundation said. ""In fact, the poorest 20 percent of Americans spend 33.6 percent of their income on food (including food at home and food away from home) and non-alcoholic beverages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey. The top 20 percent spend only 12.9 percent of their income on food."" Food taxes have also been proposed in other countries. In 2012, the UK's Health Forum and the Department of Health, in a paper called ""Measures"

This is why it's a good idea to take a look at the different types of taxes and how they affect our diets. Different types of taxes can affect us in different ways, and knowing what each of them do can help us understand what they are doing to our health. When considering the impact of taxes on our diets, we should first understand how these taxes work. When governments tax certain foods, they do it in two ways: either by restricting the amount of a certain food that can be sold in a given area, or by limiting the amount of money that can be spent on the food. Restrictions on the amount of food that can be sold are often called ""food stamps"" and they can be found in the form of taxes, or by requiring a person to purchase a certain amount of food each week. Restrictions on the amount of money that can be spent on certain foods are often called ""fees"" and they can be found in the form of taxes, or by requiring a person to pay a certain amount of money for certain foods each week. In the following sections, we'll explore the impact of taxes on our diets. Restrictions on the amount of food that can be sold are often called ""food stamps"" and they can be found in the form of taxes, or by requiring a person to purchase a certain amount of food each week.

Understanding how these taxes affect our diets is important, because taxes and fees can be the most effective ways to control the amount of food we eat. As a result, these taxes are often the most effective way to reduce the obesity epidemic. Taxes and fees also help us to be more aware of what we are eating. Taxes and fees can be very effective at reducing obesity because they can be used to reduce the amount of food we eat, as well as the amount of money we spend on food. In the United States, many states are currently trying to reduce the amount of obesity in their populations by implementing new taxes and fees. These taxes and fees are often used in conjunction with nutrition education, because people who know what they are eating will eat less of it.

PaLM,cmv-37,"As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this problem. Such taxes are often referred to as “sin taxes,” and they are designed to discourage people from consuming these foods by making them more expensive. There are a number of arguments in favor of sin taxes. First, they can raise revenue for the government, which can then be used to fund public health programs or other initiatives. Second, they can help to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods, which can lead to improved health outcomes. Third, they can send a message to consumers that the government does not endorse the consumption of these foods. However, there are also a number of arguments against sin taxes. First, they can be regressive, meaning that they disproportionately affect low-income people. Second, they can lead to unintended consequences, such as people switching to other unhealthy foods that are not taxed. Third, they can create a black market for these foods. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to implement a sin tax is a complex one. There are a number of factors to consider, including the potential benefits and harms, the feasibility of implementation, and the political will to do so. In the United States, there is currently no federal sin tax on food. However, some states do have sin taxes on specific foods, such as sugary drinks. For example, California has a tax of \$0.01 per ounce on sugary drinks. There is some evidence that sin taxes can be effective in reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods. For example, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the California sugary drink tax led to a 21% decrease in the consumption of sugary drinks among adults. However, other studies have found that sin taxes can have unintended consequences. For example, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the California sugary drink tax led to an increase in the consumption of other unhealthy foods, such as candy and ice cream. The evidence on the effectiveness of sin taxes is mixed. However, there is some evidence that they can be effective in reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to implement a sin tax is a complex one that should be made after careful consideration of all of the relevant factors. Here are some additional arguments for and against sin taxes: Arguments in favor of sin taxes:  Sin taxes can raise revenue for the government, which can then be used to fund public health programs or other initiatives.  Sin taxes can help to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods, which can lead to improved health outcomes.

BigScience,cmv-37,"As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this unsustainable trend. The government of France recently announced a new set of taxes on high-fat dairy products (in addition to some sugary drinks) that will cost consumers about 40 less for each unit purchased. The objectivity of these policies is somewhat debatable as there has been evidence indicating both positive [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38], negative [6, 39] or no effect [41] of consumption of such food items on obesity rates. Furthermore, it should be noted that not all studies found an increase in body mass index after implementation of policy changes [10, 21, 23, 24]. However, going beyond the limited number of observational studies available so far, we can only speculate at present whether increased taxation of energy-dense andor nutrient-poor foods would lead to reductions in weight gain among adults consuming those particular dietary patterns due mainly to reduced intake [14, 19, 34]. However, what remains clear from the few existing intervention trials conducted under natural settings [15-17, 18-20, 22-24] rather than within clinical research environments [20, 25-30] is that reducing availabilitydemand of certain types of information associated with healthier choices may also contribute to improving diet quality through changing eating behavior. There was little doubt however that reducing accessavailability to healthy foods had stronger beneficial effects compared to increasing demand or costs related to unhealthie foods [17, 24, 28, 29, 31-34, 36-38, 40-42 ]. Yet, even though making high-calorie low-nutrient foods more expensive might help individuals avoid excessive calories by influencing their choice towards lower-energy alternatives, other factors must play a role [4] [5] [6] [7] 26]. For example, people tend to save money when buying cheaper food instead of better ones; therefore higher prices do not mean greater savings [5, 6]. Moreover, if price increases reduce sales volume of low-quality food, then overall purchases of these poor-quality goods could decrease over time despite price rises which makes it impossible to know how much greater income gains would result from changes in taxation alone [5, 6, 10]. In fact, several authors pointed out that while increased affordability often leads to reduction in total expenditure, thereby resulting in decreased purchasing power [5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 20, 30, 32, 33, 37, 38, 42], food spending accounts for a smaller proportion of household budgets [43, 44] and thus does not necessarily translate into substantial improvements for individuals' food portfolios. Therefore, without taking into consideration potential indirect benefits -i.e., behavioral change -results obtained from empirical evaluations of direct economic interventions cannot yet provide adequate answers concerning the effectiveness of fiscal measures aimed at modifying people's nutrition habits. As a consequence, there is still a need for well-designed randomized controlled trial (s) examining the impact of different pricing strategies on consumer behaviors along with corresponding short-term physiological responses -be it weight loss or maintenance -as well as long-term nutritional outcomes measured using objective biomarkers -both qualitative (diet composition) and quantitative (nutrients). Therefore, our study aims to: 1) examine willingness-to-pay (WTP) variations between participants who were exposed to three levels of fairness scenarios designed according to theoretical principles underlying social preferences theory [1] [2] [3]; 2) evaluate real-world WTP differences based upon relative income levels; 3) explore subjective preference satisfaction following exposure to hypothetical pricing conditions involving either increased taxes or lack thereof; 4) compare actual versus expected expenditures across experimental groups including relevant socioeconomic data; 5) estimate size of hypothetical monetary transfer required to compensate one participant for hisher losses incurred by alternative money management decisions made following price manipulations; 6) determine willingness to pay per additional kilo lost or gained during follow-up period. By doing so, we aim to answer two fundamental questions regarding generalizability of results derived from laboratory experiments carried out under artificially-highlighted inequality situations: first, how representative are findings coming from experimental studies performed outside the context of everyday life [3, 45]? Second, are monetary incentive schemes effective enough to induce desired changes in eating behavior? More specifically, are participants' calculated WTP values sufficient to counterbalance anticipated financial penalties imposed by choosing diets possessing relatively fewer nutrients?

Human,cmv-38,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you're crazy. I understand where this view comes from; the [Universe is so unimaginably huge] and so filled with [galaxies] , and therefore stars, and therefore [planets] , there simply must be other life out there. My view is that this approach is fundamentally unscientific and should not be held because it is based on probability and not actual scientific evidence. My background: I am a physics and astronomy teacher, and I teach about this subject in depth every year. I think about it and research it often. I'm well acquainted with the [Drake Equation] , the [Fermi Paradox] and [its many possible solutions] , the [Great Filter] , and the debate over alien life in general. My own belief in the matter used to be strongly on the 'of course aliens exist out there' side, but I thought the distances were just too vast for us to ever observe them. However, my opinion was strongly shifted by the book Alone in the Universe by [John Gribbin] , and I now think that the great profusion of life here on Earth is so rare that we are alone in the Universe. Don't get me wrong, I'm completely open to the idea of aliens existing. I kind of hope they do, as long as they don't destroy us all! But until we get any kind of scientific evidence that they exist - an organized signal, clear alien-made trace elements on a planet's spectroscopy, anything measurable - I think the correct scientific approach is that they don't exist. CMV. Edit 1: Some good thoughts in here, thanks. Also, some incorrect assumptions about what I'm saying. Probability is of course a useful scientific tool, the key to our understanding of quantum mechanics. But guesses about the Drake Equation boil down to probability based on no data, quite different from the data-based probability of QM. The most compelling argument that I've read below is that because we know life happened once in the Universe with us, it could happen again. Physical laws of symmetry point to the idea that there are no unique events in the Universe. I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's given me something to think about. And so the crux of the argument comes down to abiogenesis, life from non-life. Is it easy or hard? Could it have happened only once? Alone in the Universe argues that a LOT of things had to go just right for us to exist. I call these things'Drake's Denominator' in class the scores of things that went just right for us that might kill the huge totals of galaxies, stars, and planets. Edit 2: Delta awarded, thanks all for your thoughts. I realized that even the single data point we have about life, life here on Earth, makes it possible for other life to exist out there. We don't have any evidence yet, but it's not unscientific to imagine that it exists. I still think life is exceedingly rare out there, and perhaps we're alone. The strange thing is that we'll probably never know. The story about [Vlad the Astrophysicist] is closer to my main view about aliens in general civilizations pop in and out of existence in no time at all, never having the chance to reach out across space and communicate.

Oh well.....we'll all find out soon enough now won't we?!I personally feel there are things mankind has yet uncovered within physics metaphysics involving parallel universes repeating multiple times; but no one really knows what these truly mean even though people claim some do know 'the truth'....sounds like most books written pertaining thereto will tend toward FUD since many cannot express themselves cogently nor analytically at least beyond simple rhetoric where ideas go unchallenged while avoiding critical thinking. commons ""critical Thinking"" ( http: en wikipedia com ments ""iteration"
Tsinghua,cmv-38,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, then you must be an atheist. (I'm using the word ""religion"" in its broadest sense here: it includes belief in a god, belief in no god, and belief in something else.) What is interesting to me is that this widely held point of view is so often wrong. In my experience, it is a frequent misperception that ""atheists"" are a monolithic group of people who all believe that life on Earth is the only life on Earth. It is a misperception because a significant number of atheists do not share this belief. I, for example, am agnostic. I don't know whether there is life on other planets or not, and I'm not particularly interested in finding out. But if there is life on other planets, that doesn't mean I am an atheist. Atheism is not an absolute. If aliens exist, and there is life on other planets, then that doesn't automatically mean that life on Earth is the only life on Earth. So I'm an atheist. But I'm not an atheist because I don't believe in alien life. I'm an atheist because I don't believe in theism. In other words, theism is a belief that there is a god. It's not the absence of a belief in a god that makes you an atheist. What does make you an atheist is the absence of belief in theism. So I'm an atheist. But I'm not an atheist because I don't believe in alien life. I'm an atheist because I don't believe in theism. What I am saying is that theistic beliefs are not just wrong, but they are wrong in a way that is far more dangerous than any belief in alien life. Theism is a belief in a god. It's a belief that there is a god. If there is a god, then we are all dead. I don't mean that we are all dead right now. I mean that if there is a god, then all of us are dead.

LLAMA,cmv-38,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you are a flat-earther or a creationist. P1: The vast majority of the universe is inhospitable to life. P2: There is a negligible chance that alien life exists. C: If you think that alien life does not exist, you are a flat-earther or a creationist. If you find that C does not follow from P1 and P2, then you are a flat-earther or a creationist. Yes, aliens exist. No, I'm not talking about the green kind with big eyes and pointy ears. Aliens are simply non-human life forms. If you define aliens as extraterrestrials, then it's also true that aliens exist. My point is that P1 is nonsense. It's nonsense because ""life"" is defined differently by different people. Just because life on earth is carbon based, doesn't mean that's the only kind of life that exists in the universe. I agree that P1 is not necessarily true. However, in this CMV, I am looking at the belief that alien life exists. zackrobbman If it is believed that alien life exists, then it is also believed that alien life is possible. If it is believed that alien life is possible, then alien life is possible. jabberwolfy I've done my best to make it as objective as possible. I don't see how this follows from P1 and P2. If aliens are possible, then it's negligible that they exist? How does that make sense? DoktorSick I agree that C does not follow. My point is that the belief in alien life is often considered to be on par with the belief that the Earth is flat. This is false. You don't have to have any faith in alien life at all to believe that aliens exist. It's possible that alien life exists without faith. Anyway, I'm not sure why you think this is a CMV. The belief that aliens exist is very common, and there's no point in trying to change that. I guess I'm trying to convince people that the belief in alien life is not outlandish. Isn't there a huge difference between believing something exists and believing something is possible? The point of the OP is that people do not understand this difference. Isn't there a huge difference between believing something exists and believing something is possible How is this a CMV? You don't have to convince anyone of anything in a CMV. I think you're trying to convince people that aliens exist. No, I'm trying to convince people that there is a difference between believing something exists and believing that something is possible. LordSnuffulupagus Yes, and I'm not interested in that debate. My point is that the belief that alien life exists is not on par with the belief that the Earth is flat. You can read the OP and the comments in this thread to understand what my point is. Except you didn't make any argument that there is a difference, all you did was assert it. This is supposed to be a CMV thread. Can you convince me that there is a difference? You can read the OP and the comments in this thread to understand what my point is I have. You are making an argument that there is a difference. No, I'm not trying to convince you that there is a difference. I'm trying to convince you that you don't have to convince anyone of anything in a CMV. I've done my best to make this CMV as objective as possible. If you can't see that there is a difference between believing something exists and believing that something is possible, then I don't know what to tell you. It's not objective.

PaLM,cmv-38,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you are being close-minded. I believe this is a misunderstanding of what it means to be open-minded. Being open-minded does not mean believing everything you hear, it means being willing to consider new evidence and change your beliefs if the evidence warrants it. There are many reasons why someone might not believe in alien life. They might not have seen any evidence for it, they might think it is too unlikely, or they might have religious beliefs that conflict with the idea of extraterrestrial life. All of these are valid reasons to not believe in aliens, and they do not make someone close-minded. Being close-minded means refusing to consider new evidence or changing your beliefs in the face of new evidence. If someone refuses to believe in alien life even after being presented with convincing evidence, then they are being close-minded. However, simply not believing in aliens does not mean someone is close-minded. There are many reasons why someone might not believe in alien life, and they are all valid. It is important to be respectful of other people's beliefs, even if we don't agree with them. Just because someone doesn't believe in aliens doesn't mean they are close-minded. Here are some of the reasons why someone might not believe in alien life:  Lack of evidence: There is no concrete evidence that aliens exist. The only evidence we have is circumstantial, such as the discovery of life on Earth and the fact that there are billions of other planets in the universe. However, this evidence is not enough to convince everyone that aliens exist.  Improbability: Some people believe that it is too unlikely that aliens exist. They point out that the universe is vast and that the chances of life evolving on another planet are very small.  Religious beliefs: Some people's religious beliefs conflict with the idea of extraterrestrial life. For example, some people believe that God created the Earth and that humans are the only intelligent life in the universe. These are all valid reasons why someone might not believe in alien life. It is important to be respectful of other people's beliefs, even if we don't agree with them. Just because someone doesn't believe in aliens doesn't mean they are close-minded. Now, let's look at the other side of the argument. There are also many reasons why someone might believe in alien life.  The Drake equation: The Drake equation is a mathematical formula that estimates the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation takes into account factors such as the number of stars in the galaxy, the number of planets that can support life, and the probability that life will evolve on those planets. The Drake equation suggests that there could be billions of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  The Fermi paradox: The Fermi paradox is a paradox that asks why we haven't encountered any alien civilizations yet. If there are billions of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, why haven't we made contact with any of them? There are many possible explanations for the Fermi paradox, such as the fact that alien civilizations are too far away to communicate with us, or that they have already destroyed themselves.  Personal experiences: Some people believe in alien life because they have had personal experiences that they believe are evidence of alien contact. These experiences range from seeing UFOs to being abducted by aliens. These are all valid reasons why someone might believe in alien life. It is important to be respectful of other people's beliefs, even if we don't agree with them. Just because someone believes in aliens doesn't mean they are close-minded. In conclusion, there are many reasons why someone might believe or not believe in alien life. It is important to be respectful of other people's beliefs, even if we don't agree with them. Just because someone doesn't believe in aliens doesn't mean they are close-minded, and just because someone believes in aliens doesn't mean they are open-minded."
OpenAI,cmv-38,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you are closed-minded. I understand your point, and I agree that it is not fair to label someone as closed-minded just because they have a different view. However, it is important to consider the context in which the idea of alien life arises. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would have tremendous implications for our understanding of the universe, our place in it, and our understanding of life itself. The possibility of alien life has been a subject of scientific and philosophical inquiry for centuries, and many people believe that it is highly probable based on what we know about the universe's vastness and the conditions necessary for life to exist. In light of this, some people might view the denial of the possibility of alien life as a denial of the scientific and philosophical potential of the idea, and consequently, as closed-minded. However, this does not mean that someone who doesn't believe in alien life is inherently closed-minded. Rather, it means that they should acknowledge the scientific and philosophical implications of the possibility of extraterrestrial life, even if they ultimately conclude that it is improbable."
BigScience,cmv-38,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist.

We know deep down inside that something extraordinary and profoundly different than anything we've experienced before happened a long time ago when this planet was just formed from dust and gas...and there is evidence all over our planetary system for Earth-like planets with watery surfaces.

Tsinghua,cmv-39,"To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific benefit to humans. The moral justification for eating meat is about the greater good of humanity. I believe that if you're willing to buy into that, you're also willing to eat animals. mattlutze I think it's the right decision to eat meat. It is also the right decision to eat vegan. Both choices have their strengths and weaknesses, and in a perfect world, we'd have the power to choose. I think there are reasons to be anti-meat and vegan, and those reasons exist, but I don't think they justify over-generalizing the veganism movement to be something that just applies to veganism. aaronem I'm not anti-meat, but I'm also not vegan. I eat dairy, eggs, and chicken. mattlutze I agree that all animals deserve protection, and I'm sure you don't mean to imply otherwise. However, you're still not vegan. You eat dairy and eggs, and you eat chicken. If you truly care about the suffering of animals, you shouldn't eat dairy, eggs, or chicken. aaronem I think it's not a fair criticism to say I'm not vegan because I eat dairy, eggs, and chicken. I'm vegan in the sense that I do not consume animal products. myasym I know this is controversial, but I would rather live in a world where people eat other animals than in a world where they don't. I think it's less risky to be a meat eater than it is to be a vegetarian, and I'd rather not take the risk. I do realize that it is much more important to take the risk of the other world. helen842000 I agree. I don't eat meat but if you can't justify that, you shouldn't eat it. I'm not saying you should go vegan, but you should be honest with yourself and be open to the consequences. aaronem I don't know how honest you are with yourself, but I think it's a fair criticism to say I'm not vegan because I eat dairy, eggs, and chicken.

I don't think I'm being a hypocrite by saying I'm not a vegetarian. I'm not saying you're a hypocrite, just saying that if you're not willing to go vegan, don't go vegetarian. sergiotapia It's not about the meat. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do eat eggs, fish and cheese. I can't imagine a world without eggs, I can't imagine not eating cheese or fish. The main issue is not about the meat, it's about the millions of animals who are kept in inhumane conditions and suffer every day of their life, while humans sit back and consume it. mehmetthesun The biggest issue is the millions of people who are starving, but I guess we are not willing to give up our comforts and conveniences to feed the starving. peteradio But how do you know they are starving? It's easy to have a nice life with access to food and all the other modern conveniences. deciplex It's easy to get access to food when you don't starve. Starvation is not a requirement for starvation. theandrewbailey There are 2 billion people on the planet. If 5 of them don't have access to food, it's a significant problem."
PaLM,cmv-39,"To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific nutritional need for it. Animals are not sentient beings like humans, and they do not have the same capacity for suffering. Therefore, the suffering of animals is not as morally significant as the suffering of humans. In addition, eating meat is a part of our culture and history. For many people, it is a source of pleasure and enjoyment. If we were to stop eating meat, it would have a significant impact on our culture and way of life. Finally, the benefits of eating meat outweigh the costs. Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is also a relatively cheap source of food. If we were to stop eating meat, we would have to find other ways to get these nutrients, which could be more expensive and less convenient. For all of these reasons, I believe that it is morally justified to continue eating meat. Animals are not sentient beings like humans, and their suffering is not as morally significant as the suffering of humans. Eating meat is a part of our culture and history, and it provides us with a number of benefits. Therefore, I believe that it is the right thing to do. However, I do believe that we should take steps to reduce the amount of suffering that animals experience. We should avoid eating meat from animals that have been abused, and we should support farms that practice humane treatment of animals. We should also make an effort to eat less meat and more plant-based foods. By doing these things, we can help to reduce the amount of suffering that animals experience while still enjoying the benefits of eating meat. Here are some specific examples of how we can reduce the amount of suffering that animals experience:  Avoid eating meat from animals that have been abused. This means buying meat from farms that practice humane treatment of animals. You can find out which farms practice humane treatment by looking for the USDA organic seal or the Animal Welfare Approved seal.  Support farms that practice humane treatment of animals. You can support farms that practice humane treatment by buying meat from them directly or by donating to organizations that support them.  Eat less meat and more plant-based foods. By eating less meat, you can reduce the demand for meat and help to reduce the number of animals that are raised for food. You can also choose to eat more plant-based foods, which are healthier for you and the environment."

BigScience,cmv-39,"To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific medical benefit for our bodies - all in the name of having fun. I think just about everyone agrees that if you feel like you're making your life miserable by eating this particular food (or any food) then stop doing it until you're happy again. There are few things worse than feeling unhappy because you've stopped something that's part of your daily routine. Don't be so quick to judge people who don't eat certain foods as weird or backwards and say ""hey, I love my hamburger"" while at home on only a salad diet. You can't force anyone not to do what they want to unless they're starving or forced to. You're free to make other people's choices against their will but never tell them how to live their lives. Hate is toxic too. Everyone hates the person next door who's unmarried and has three kids with her boyfriend. But it's okay when someone else doesn't crave sugar every day which means she avoids processed foods full of added sugars and refined carbs. She doesn't have to make excuses for living simply. She's free to enjoy whatever pleases her."
Human,cmv-39,"To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's.

This is the same thing; most of the time, we aren't hunting because we need to, we're hunting because we want to. What this selective outrage over Cecil tells me is that we, as a society, simply don't have any unified logic towards how we are supposed to treat animals and instead attach our moral views of animal treatment to whatever our culture finds fashionable. Walter James Palmer is potentially going to face criminal charges while Tyson and Perdue make an industry out of their treatment of animals. There is little difference. Edit: My opinion on this has been changed. Cecil's existence as a national treasure to Zimbabwe is enough to justify selective outrage. Moreover, Cecil's death specifically highlights issues inherent in illegal poaching. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

LLAMA,cmv-39,"To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific need for animal products. I'm a vegetarian, but I'm not going to lie and say it's all about the animals. I'd happily kill a chicken to save my child's life. I'd likely do so to save my own. This doesn't mean that I think it's morally okay to kill a chicken for no reason; rather, I think that if I had to choose between a chicken and a human, I'd choose the human. This attitude is also why I support hunting. I think it's a lot more ethical to take a deer by force than it is to send someone else out to kill a cow on your behalf. There's just something about the cow that makes it more deserving of life than the deer, and I can't really justify it to myself. The same philosophy extends to the treatment of animals in general. I'm not opposed to keeping pets, but I think it's a bit weird. I mean, you're essentially holding another being in slavery for your own pleasure. How is that okay? Why do we not treat other humans this way? Well, I guess it's because we do. There are plenty of people who voluntarily submit themselves to slavery. BDSM is a thing, after all. I think the justification for pets is that humans get enjoyment out of owning and taking care of other lifeforms. And animals get some enjoyment out of being owned and taken care of. It's not the most moral of exchanges, but it's not necessarily bad. I mean, it's bad for the animal, but the animal still gets some benefits out of it. So I guess that makes it okay. I don't think it's great, but I don't think it's evil. That's why I have a hard time getting behind people who feel that it's wrong to declaw cats. To understand why, you first have to understand what declawing a cat means. It's not just a clipping of the nails. It's a surgical removal of the claws. It's painful, and cats often struggle to adapt. The way it's done in America is largely inhumane, but I'm not sure how it's done in other parts of the world. And why do people declaw cats? Well, mostly because cats can be assholes. They scratch up furniture, rugs, and people. The scratching doesn't hurt, but it leaves marks and rips in your furniture. Some cats like to jump into people's laps only to proceed to scratch their faces. I know a few people who have owned cats and ended up regretting it because the cats were so disruptive. Declawing is a popular option because it gets rid of the behavior without getting rid of the cat. Declawing is not great for the cat, and there are plenty of people who are up in arms over it. I mean, if you really want to make sure your couch doesn't get scratched up, you can buy special couches that are scratch-proof. You could also just keep your couch covered in a blanket or towel. And you can also train your cat to not scratch things. I think this is where we get to the crux of the issue: people don't want to put in the effort to train their cat. It's hard to do, and you'll often have to go through several scratches before you get it right. I think this is also where we get to the crux of my argument: it's fine. No, not fine as in good, but fine as in okay. I don't think it's good to declaw your cat. I think it's cruel. I wouldn't do it myself. But I also think that your cat's happiness is less important than your own. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm not trying to be mean. But I think it's important to put things into perspective. Human life is worth more than animal life. It's not that the animal doesn't have a life or doesn't have value. It's just that the human has more value. And so if you want to cut your cat's claws off so you can keep it in your house, then you can go right ahead. And if that"
BigScience,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, that sort of thing). The fat shamer side is pretty easily defeated by evidence. People who want to lose weight are going to be motivated when they see other people with a lot more body mass index than themselves having had successful weight loss via surgery or exercise. The point about the ""fat acceptance"" argument is sometimes valid but often misguided: it assumes that all people will accept someone else's personal quirks regardless of how we perceive them as flaws. When you get really close friends, it's not unreasonable to expect they'll share your views on an issue such as this one. A: ""You don't say much about yourself except you've got a family history that's stuck in your head from decades ago...You lie awake at night wondering what happened to him? Why did he leave us? You go over everything again - looking for a clue... Your doctor doesn't believe you're suffering because he's been feeding you a diet that's loaded up with saturated fats and cholesterol. You've tried every fad diet out there - quitting smoking, eating less sugar, avoiding meat products, trying to limit butter and margarine, limiting dairy products, no alcohol, nothing too spicy... And still, after years of watching people's lives change dramatically around you, you just can't shake the nagging worry that something might've gone wrong with their bodies. That maybe they've lost lots of pounds and then stopped progressing even though they're doing things right? I'm sorry to disappoint you: Your doctors aren't stupid! They know exactly what's happening to you! They use tests to check if any abnormalities are developing. But whatever those results show, there's always a chance that they're not worth worrying about. And yes, some may develop conditions later down the line which affect your life. I understand why you'd think your concerns would warrant further investigation; I was once where you are. It wasn't until my GP pointed me towards psychologists working within the NHS that these fears finally dissipated. As far as I'm concerned, we're very fortunate that our medical profession has developed a good understanding of psychological health issues like anxiety, depression and stress-related illnesses. That's made it possible for many of us to live long and healthy lives without fear. If you'd prefer, you can also find support online through organisations such as Mind, Anxiety UK, Bipolar Trust and British Psychological Society. All provide free counselling services to both adults and children. But please do make sure that you consult a professional before taking medication. Medication isn't magic bullets, it's just another tool available along with therapy. (In fact, I'd suggest against giving it unless you feel absolutely confident that your symptoms aren't responding well enough to counselling.)"
Human,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, with either benign or malicious intentions. First of all, I don't buy HAES. I believe that anyone of any size can be healthier at that size. If I start jogging once a week, I probably won't lose weight, but I'll be a teeny-tiny bit healthier and that's good. Secondly, BMI is an overall population indicator. There are of course given people who are overweight who are healthier than given people who are within normal range. Same goes for given people who are underweight vs people in normal range. However, I would state that in general, the further you slide on the scale from 22.5 in either direction, the further you're getting from optimal. However, wherever people lie on that scale - underweight - optimal - fat is none of your fucking business whatsoever. You are not a stakeholder in a stranger's health and people would do well to keep their mouths shut about other people's appearance. If you are stakeholder in their health (and this is exclusively limited to loved ones and the person's healthcare practitioners) then maybe you get to say something. Maybe. The best analogy for this is smoking. I smoke and am slightly overweight (10lb) and it is certainly the smoking that is more detrimental to my health than the few extra pounds. I know that smoking is bad for me - I'm not an idiot. I view the HAES as a bit like ""Healthy No Matter How Much You Smoke."" It's not true, it may even be damaging. On the other hand, encouraging hardened smokers to run around despite being smokers ain't a bad thing. Attack the campaign, if you must, but leave the people alone. It does not matter how many people tell me that smoking is bad for me. Their statements are uninvited, irritating and will do precisely nothing to change my habits. They may even reinforce them. It is none of their business if I smoke. You know when you're eating pizza and you have that one vegan health nut friend who tells you about how pepperoni is full of carcinogens and dairy will cause all kinds of damage to you? That, at best is what fat shamers come off like. I'm not saying there shouldn't be public health campaigns (much like we have anti-smoking campaigns), just that YOU PERSONALLY should never say a damn thing about a stranger's weight, EVER. EDIT: Good discussion, guys. I'm going on a delta spree now, because as uThereOnceWasAMan put it: ""OPs view is that ""others' weight is none of your business,"" not ""you shouldn't shame people for being overweight."" They are annoyingly correct in that that is how I should have phrased it. EDIT 2: Work has come up and I have to run off for the evening. I'll come back to this to give s to the deserving. Sorry for the delay! Don't bully fat people, kids. It helps no one. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Tsinghua,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, who claim to know what's best for us, and who aren't comfortable with the idea of having a fat person as a friend, co-worker, etc.). You have ""normal"" folks in the middle who are neither one or the other, but are curious about how their lifestyle choices affect their health. And you have those who feel that they have some special knowledge that allows them to know how to ""cure"" fat people. But no one is ""right."" Everyone has an opinion. And that's fine. I don't agree with the body-positive folks about everything. I think it's important to acknowledge that there are people who need help losing weight. And if I thought that it would make people healthier, I would encourage them to do so. But I don't think that's the best course of action. I'm a very slow and deliberate eater. And that's how I've always eaten. It's not my fault that my genes have turned out that way. I don't think I have an eating disorder. I think that eating whatever I want, as long as I eat it slowly and deliberately, is fine. It's what makes me happy. I'm not a self-hating fat person. I'm not a self-loathing fat person. I'm a fat person who happens to be a person who happens to be happy with how she looks. I think that if I ate more slowly, I would be healthier. But I'm not going to do that. And I don't think that anyone else should. You can't force someone to lose weight. You can't force someone to change their diet. You can't force someone to exercise. But you can't just sit there and tell them what they should do. If you're the person who knows best, why don't you just stop trying to tell me what to do? What if I don't want to do anything? I'm happy the way I am. You think that's selfish? So what? I'm not going to be a ""good"" person for you. I'm going to be happy the way I am. And if that means that I don't lose weight, then so be it. It's not your fault that I'm not a size 2. And it's not your fault that I'm happy the way I am. And it's not your fault that I'm not willing to do anything to change that. If you think that I'm ""selfish,"" you're the one who's ""selfish."" Because you're forcing me to do something that I don't want to do. And you're not happy with how I look. And you don't like me. So why don't you just leave me alone? I don't need you to tell me what to do. I don't need you to change me. I don't need you to force me to do anything. And if you think that I'm fat, then why don't you just leave me alone? And if you think that I'm a bad person because I'm fat, then why don't you just leave me alone? And if you think that I should be ashamed of my body, then why don't you just leave me alone? I don't need you to tell me what to do. I don't need you to change me. I don't need you to force me to do anything. I'm not a ""bad"" person. I'm not a ""selfish"" person. I'm not a ""bad"" person because I'm fat. And I'm not a ""selfish"" person because I'm fat. I'm not a ""bad"" person because I'm fat. And I'm not a ""selfish"" person because I'm fat.

OpenAI,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, often through body shaming or weight stigma). As an AI language model, I am programmed to be neutral and unbiased on such issues. However, it is important to acknowledge that everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their body size or shape. We should encourage people to prioritize their health and well-being, but we should also recognize that body size is not always an indication of health. It's essential to focus on creating a positive and supportive environment where people can make informed choices about their health and lifestyle without feeling judged, and we should strive to promote body positivity and inclusivity."
PaLM,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, often in a cruel and shaming way). Both of these sides have their own set of arguments and beliefs, and it can be difficult to see where the truth lies. However, one thing is for sure: the fat debate is a complex one with no easy answers. The Fat Acceptance Movement The fat acceptance movement is a social movement that promotes the acceptance of people of all sizes. It argues that fat people should not be discriminated against or shamed for their weight, and that they should be able to live their lives without being judged. The movement also challenges the idea that thinness is the only desirable body type, and that it is possible to be healthy at any size. The fat acceptance movement has been gaining momentum in recent years, as more and more people are speaking out against fatphobia and discrimination. However, it is still a controversial movement, and there are many who disagree with its message. Arguments in Favor of the Fat Acceptance Movement There are a number of arguments in favor of the fat acceptance movement. Some of these include:  Fat people are not inherently unhealthy. There is no evidence to suggest that fat people are more likely to be unhealthy than thin people. In fact, a recent study found that obese people who exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet are just as healthy as thin people who do the same.  Fat shaming is harmful. Fat shaming can lead to a number of negative consequences, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. It can also lead to people avoiding medical care, which can be dangerous.  Fat people deserve to be treated with respect. Fat people are just as deserving of respect as thin people. They should not be discriminated against or shamed for their weight. Arguments Against the Fat Acceptance Movement There are also a number of arguments against the fat acceptance movement. Some of these include:  Being fat is unhealthy. There is evidence to suggest that being overweight or obese is associated with a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.  Fat acceptance can lead to weight gain. Some people believe that the fat acceptance movement encourages people to give up on trying to lose weight, which can lead to weight gain.  Fat acceptance is enabling. Some people believe that the fat acceptance movement enables people to stay fat and unhealthy. They believe that people should be encouraged to lose weight for their own health. The Truth About Fat The truth about fat is that it is a complex issue with no easy answers. There are both risks and benefits to being overweight or obese, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to weight management. However, it is important to remember that fat people are not inherently unhealthy, and they deserve to be treated with respect. Conclusion The fat debate is a complex one with no easy answers. However, it is important to remember that fat people are just as deserving of respect as thin people. They should not be discriminated against or shamed for their weight."
LLAMA,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, which is often a complete crock). I believe that this is not an either-or situation. There are a lot of people out there, men and women, who are fat and don't want to be. For them, the answer is not to simply accept their fatness and refuse to lose weight. For them, the answer is a healthy combination of diet and exercise. I'm one of these people. I'm fat, and I don't want to be. I want to lose weight, and I'm going to do so through a healthy combination of diet and exercise. That said, I'm going to continue to speak out against fat shaming. I will continue to support the rights of fat people to be treated with the same dignity as anyone else. I will continue to support the rights of fat people to clothe themselves as they wish and take part in society as they wish. I just will not accept fatness as the end of the story. Labels: fat acceptance movement, fat shaming, Healthy At Every Size, Personal While I've always considered myself a feminist, I've never been a very vocal one. I've always been a bit of a wallflower, and when it comes to feminism, I've always been happy to let more articulate people than myself speak out on the subject. That said, lately I've been feeling very vocal about feminism. I feel like I need to speak out more and more. Perhaps it's because I've been seeing so much more open misogyny in the media and in the news. I've never seen so much rape apologia before, and now I'm seeing it almost every day. It's disgusting. Labels: feminism, misogyny, Personal, rape apologia For the life of me, I've never been able to figure out the argument against gay marriage. The argument I hear the most is the one that goes like this: ""Gay marriage is immoral!"" This argument makes no sense to me, because it's not an argument at all. It's a tautology. It's basically saying ""Gay marriage is wrong because it's wrong!"" It's circular reasoning, a logical fallacy. The only argument against gay marriage I've ever heard that's not a logical fallacy is ""Gay marriage is immoral, because God says so!"" This argument makes no sense to me, because it's not an argument at all. It's an appeal to authority. Basically, it's saying ""Gay marriage is wrong because God says so, and he's always right!"" This doesn't make any sense to me, because it's not an argument against gay marriage. It's an argument against atheism. You can't argue against gay marriage without arguing against atheism. Labels: atheism, gay marriage, Personal, tautology I'm a fan of comic books, and I've been following the controversy surrounding the character of Starfire, and I have to say that I find it very discouraging. In the 1980s, DC Comics created a character called Starfire. This is Starfire: Starfire was, at first, an alien princess from a world called Tamaran. She was captured by the alien Psions and forced to fight in gladiatorial matches. She escaped and joined the Teen Titans, a group of superpowered teenage heroes. She was, essentially, a child soldier who escaped from her captors and fled to Earth. This is Starfire in the 1980s, from the Teen Titans comic book: In the 1990s, a TV show was made about the Teen Titans, and Starfire was included. This show had nothing to do with the comic books, and Starfire was very different. This is Starfire in the 1990s, from the Teen Titans cartoon show: In the 2000s, a new Teen Titans cartoon show was made, and Starfire was included. This show was based on the comic books, and Starfire was much closer to her comic book counterpart. This is Starfire in the 2000s, from the Teen Titans cartoon show: In"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-40,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, who point at them to shame their behavior). Even though I've come across this idea in several places now: it seems there are a couple of different things we think when talking about body image. We can talk either how much space one's own personal self takes up or what other person perceive our bodies as having taken-up... And if an obese woman loses 100 pounds she will still be considered larger than any single slim women around her.... The main problem with that is just starting from where? If all your female friends were 5 feet tall then would they agree more easilymore quickly by saying 'Hey! You're really short!' rather thn say' Hey!! Your legs look huge.' When both statements seem true but apply completely differently for every individual because so many variables make each situation unique - such being height figure type (s) fit together uniquely per particular human.. ianalogiccally impossible does not mean improbable; i want something better worded here too sorry)... Because while some may argue those extra few inches could go anywhere else like arms without making sense why anyone oughta care let alone criticize someone over anything related thereto... Another age old debate aside:Slimming diet pillsYou'll lose between 1 - 3lbs.in 7 days which equals roughly 2 lbs weekHow long do most diets take?Typically 6 monthsRecommended Diet Plan:-Drink lots fluids.-Avoid oily foods, high calories food items close after meals., cakes,-Ban refined sugar intake [ don't drink coke , carbo loading before workouts. (After workout eat less) -Take fiber supplements instead taking laxativesStart doing cardio exercise 4 times weekly minimum 30 minutes sessions until comfortable enough increasing time wise gradually upto 45 mins twice daily once recovery day has endedAdd protein supplement everyday alongwith regular dose vitamin multivitamin drinks"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-41,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that this is why school sucks for me but it's hard to deal with because my teachers think i don't care about learning which they keep telling everybody How can someone be good at something without putting effort into doing so? It always comes down on how much time you put forth working towards your goal versus enjoying yourself or having fun while being lazy most of times"
PaLM,cmv-41,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that this is not a good thing, but I just can't seem to help myself. I'm not sure why I'm like this, but I've been this way for as long as I can remember. I've tried to change, but I just can't seem to stick with it. I'll start out strong, but then I'll get lazy and fall back into my old habits. I know that this is hurting my grades and my future, but I just don't know what to do. I've talked to my teachers and my parents, but they don't seem to understand. They tell me that I need to study and do my homework, but they don't seem to get that I just can't do it. I've tried explaining to them that I'm not lazy, I just don't have the motivation to study. But they don't seem to believe me. I'm starting to feel like I'm all alone in this. I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I'm starting to think that I'm just going to be a bad student for the rest of my life. I know that I need to change, but I just don't know how. I'm so tired of being a bad student. I want to be able to succeed in school, but I just don't know how. If you're reading this and you're a bad student, just know that you're not alone. There are other people out there who are going through the same thing. You're not a bad person, you just have to find a way to overcome your struggles. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I'm not going to give up. I'm going to keep trying until I find a way to succeed. I know that I can do it, and I know that you can too. Here are a few things that have helped me:  Find a study buddy. Having someone to study with can help you stay motivated and accountable.  Set small goals. Don't try to change everything all at once. Start by setting small goals, like studying for 10 minutes each day or doing one homework assignment.  Find a quiet place to study. Studying in a noisy environment can make it difficult to focus. Find a place where you can be alone and undisturbed.  Take breaks. Studying for long periods of time can be counterproductive. Take breaks throughout the day to rest your mind and body.  Reward yourself. When you achieve a goal, reward yourself with something you enjoy. This will help you stay motivated and on track. I know that being a bad student is tough. But it's not impossible to change. If you're willing to put in the work, you can achieve anything."
LLAMA,cmv-41,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand the concepts and have a good understanding of the material, but I'm just lazy and don't do the homework. I still receive high grades and in the classes I do homework, I have an A, and in the classes I don't do homework I have a B. I'm planning on going to a community college next year and I'm worried that when I get there I'll really have to study and do the homework and I won't be able to pull the grades I'm currently receiving. What should I do? Before you head to community college, you need to change your attitude about schoolwork. You need to understand that there are a couple of very important reasons to do your homework. The first reason is that you need to do your homework and study in order to actually learn the material. Most students are not able to understand a concept simply by listening to an instructor speak. They need to practice it on their own in order to master it. The second reason is that you need to do your homework and study in order to prove to your instructor that you actually learned the material. If you're not doing your homework, you're not proving to your instructor that you actually learned the material. You're proving that you're not able to do the homework, and that could mean that you're not learning the material. I understand that you say you are not having any trouble getting good grades in your current classes, but that might not always be the case. You need to learn that it's not okay to just rely on the fact that you understand concepts in order to get good grades. You also need to know that in the real world, employers are going to be looking for people who are able to do their homework and prove that they understand the material. If you don't get your act together now and start doing your homework and studying, you're going to find yourself in a lot of trouble when you head off to a community college. So start doing your homework and studying for your tests, and keep that up until the end of the semester. I'm a horrible student who doesn't do the homework and never studies. What should I do?"
BigScience,cmv-41,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that studyingdoing your own homework is important for your grades but it just seems so hard to get motivated or think of ways on how to improve my situation. Even though I have been having very little success with writing papers (not being able to finish them because they are too long) etc., I still am trying to figure out if there might be solutions or possible strategies which can help me become more successful at learning things from courses? I know it's quite late now, but does anyone else struggle as much? If yes - what kind of methods did you use (and worked well)? A word of advice: before wasting time reading through this thread - try starting by going over these questions. They will give you an idea about your current self-studying habits. A: I've found that even when I'm not doing particularly good work on assignments I've got hitched up and hurrying off into the next assignment; instead I'll sit down and actually read the material. Instead of looking at a problem statement for 20 minutes then going back to check whether I managed something useful, I'd spend 30-50 minutes focusing entirely on understanding the source material. This has proved fruitful, often leading to deeper insight than would otherwise arise. In short, don't beat yourself up; accept you're struggling and move onto something new!"
Human,cmv-41,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. Don't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school. Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 5050 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0 gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the ""best"" colleges and a majority of them will not make it. I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0 gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0 gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way. Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. It's been very helpful and I'll be visiting this thread in the future when my determination will inevitably falter. Hello, users of CMV!

I understand that it can be very difficult to stay motivated and engaged in your studies, especially when the material may not seem interesting or relevant to you. However, I want to reassure you that it's never too late to turn things around and become a better student. Here are some tips that could help you improve your study habits and get back on track: 1. Set specific and achievable goals: Start by identifying what you want to achieve academically and then break them into smaller, manageable goals. Make sure they are achievable and realistic for you. 2. Develop a consistent study routine: Establish a study schedule that aligns with your daily routine and stick to it. Try to find a time of day when you are most alert and focused. 3. Seek help: Don't hesitate to seek help from your teacher, tutor or classmates when you need it. They can offer valuable insights and guidance. 4. Stay motivated: Find ways to keep yourself motivated, such as setting rewards for meeting your goals, listening to music while studying, or studying with a friend. Remember, becoming a better student is a process that takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself as you work through these changes and stay committed to achieving your academic goals."
OpenAI,cmv-42,"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a I understand. Is there anything specific you need assistance with or any questions you have on the topic?"
Tsinghua,cmv-42,"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a silly reason. A: The wiki page on delta changes has a list of all available deltas. This includes all changes that have been made by the developer, and the changes that have been made by the wiki admin. In addition, the wiki admin has the option to create new deltas from any of the others. So in your case, the delta that you are looking for is: The difference between this page and the previous version of the page. It contains all the changes that have been made by the developer, but none of the changes that have been made by the wiki admin. The reason why you were not able to find the changes that the wiki admin made, is that the page was edited by the wiki admin, but not edited by the developer. You can see that in the timeline of the page, in the bottom right corner, there is a little line that looks like this: 5 hours ago by The Developer and the timeline of the wiki admin looks like this: 3 hours ago by The Wiki Admin If you go to the page, you will see that there is a delta that contains all the changes that have been made by the wiki admin, but none of the changes that have been made by the developer. So if you add this delta to the page, it will show the changes that the wiki admin made."
Human,cmv-42,"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: ""there is no consistent moral framework."" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral. After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said ""CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them"" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.

LLAMA,cmv-42,"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a unique situation, and not what I was looking for in terms of a general rule. I'm looking for a delta for a 2 or 4 match. I've already found some 3 and 4 matches, but I don't really want to leave this unresolved. The problem with finding a 2 or 4 match is that I only have 10,000 SNPs, and many of the 2 or 4 matches I find on Gedmatch don't have any of those SNPs. So I'm looking for a delta that I can use as a rule of thumb. I want to be able to type in someone's 2 or 4 match and find out how many cMs I need to add on, to get an accurate percentage. I know the rule of thumb is 7 cMs per , but that seems to be overshooting in some cases, and underestimating in others. I think I'm going to have to get a larger set of SNPs to do this accurately, but I have already looked at a lot of data and I'm kind of at a loss for what a good delta is. In the meantime, I'm hoping someone here might have some ideas. EDIT: I have a spreadsheet of a lot of data here: I have some data for third and fourth cousins. I've also found a good reference: I will be trying to use that, and I would still like some responses here, but I think the link above will be a good place to start. Re: Delta for 2 or 4 match? Postby Eilish "" Wed Apr 26, 2017 8:44 am There's a lot of factors at play in determining a good delta for these smaller shared segment sizes. First off, what are your shared segment sizes? I find that when you look at 3rd or 4th cousins the shared segment sizes are usually in the 15-25 cM range and the largest segment will usually be in the 15-20 cM range. At that size, it's more likely to be a valid match. I would be a little leery of any match that was below 15cM or if the largest segment was below 15cM for a 3rd cousin, or below 20cM for a 4th cousin. When you look at a match like this, if the match is much smaller than your typical 3rd or 4th cousin match, then I would look at where it lies on the chromosome. If it's on the ends of the chromosome then it's more likely to be an IBS segment (I know that you already know this, but it's worth repeating). When looking at shared matches with a 2nd cousin, you can see where they overlap and make some inferences about the relationships of the other people in the match. It's usually a combination of a few things. I've tried to put the various factors into a table for you. Most Shared CM's If you are seeing a match that has 50cM's, and the largest segment is 30cM or above, and the match is either an in-common match, or the match shares with you on both sides of the segment, and they have a significant amount of shared CM's, and they have a lot of shared matches, then you are likely looking at a 2nd cousin. Any other combination of factors would make the match less likely to be a 2nd cousin, and more likely to be a 3rd or 4th cousin. Hopefully this table helps you out.

BigScience,cmv-42,"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a weird case. This is an actual situation that I'm working with. The thing is: A committer has made some changes and then committed them. As part of committing they do something very unusual: they make all code work for both cases where there are no attributes or when there's only one attribute (the default). How could we reasonably handle such commits? At first glance we can just delete any bad branches automatically as soon as they're created, since it's not possible to revert it later on without also changing other code that's being used by another branch. (This gets even worse if multiple people had to touch the same node at once.) Is what I've described above reasonable either? (Other than maybe having different versions available.) If so how should it be handled? A: If you want to keep your system sane in most circumstances you probably need to: write arguments against deleting branches that get deleted, store all branches before deletion; work backwards from current state after deletion, which makes using Git's reflogs very useful. But I'll let someone else answer the question about whether it ""feels right."" A: Often the best approach is simply to ignore these kinds of situations - if you're going to fix everything you likely won't use git anymore;)"
LLAMA,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi. A horrible accident, but who is to blame? After the girl had shot the Superviser, Charles Vacca, her parents took a camera out and filmed their little girl shooting the Uzi. This is what I think is really despicable. This is a great example of what is wrong with the world. People filming their kids doing dangerous things and uploading them on Youtube. This is just wrong, a child is being exploited to get hits on Youtube. I know that the girl and her parents are not to blame for the shooting of the Superviser. That was an accident, but it is unbelievable that they then filmed their child shooting the Uzi. All that is on their minds was to get hits on Youtube and make a name for themselves. This kind of thing can destroy a young girls life. I watched that video and it made me feel sick. I think it's a shame that people are using their children to make money. If it is your passion, your child is interested in it and you are both having fun, then that's different. I wouldn't want my kids on you tube though. Not for any money in the world. I watched the video of the 9 year old girl shooting the Uzi and it made me feel sick. It is absolutely disgusting that her parents would film this. I feel so sorry for the little girl, it is unfair that she should be exploited like this. I think that it is wrong to put your child on Youtube. I think it is unfair to exploit them in this way."
Human,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic. From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms. This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc. Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother twice as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible. I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right. You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die. EDIT: ucaw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred. EDIT 2: uincruente and uZorthianator have completely changed my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

PaLM,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 rifle. The Superviser was standing behind her, giving her instructions. The girl pulled the trigger and the bullet hit the Superviser in the head, killing him instantly. The girl was devastated by what had happened. She had never intended to hurt anyone. She was just learning how to shoot a gun and she made a mistake. The Superviser's family was also devastated. They lost a loved one in a senseless accident. This case raises a number of important questions about gun safety. Should children be allowed to use guns? Should there be more safety precautions at gunranges? How can we prevent accidents like this from happening again? There are no easy answers to these questions. But it is clear that we need to have a serious conversation about gun safety. We need to make sure that guns are used safely and that accidents like this one do not happen again. One of the most important things we can do to prevent accidents like this one is to teach children about gun safety. Children need to know that guns are dangerous and that they should never be played with. They need to learn how to handle guns safely and how to store them properly. We also need to make sure that there are adequate safety precautions at gunranges. Gunranges should have clear rules and regulations about how guns are to be used. They should also have adequate safety equipment, such as eye protection and ear protection. Finally, we need to have a conversation about the role of guns in our society. Do we really need to have so many guns in circulation? Are there ways to reduce the number of guns without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens? These are complex questions, but they are questions that we need to answer. We need to find ways to prevent accidents like this one from happening again. Here are some specific steps that we can take to prevent accidents like this one:  Teach children about gun safety. Children need to know that guns are dangerous and that they should never be played with. They need to learn how to handle guns safely and how to store them properly.  Enforce existing gun laws. There are already a number of laws in place that are designed to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We need to make sure that these laws are enforced.  Pass new gun laws. There are a number of new gun laws that we can pass that would help to prevent accidents. For example, we could require universal background checks for all gun purchases, or we could ban assault weapons.  Create a culture of gun safety. We need to change the way that we think about guns in our society. We need to move away from the idea that guns are a necessary part of everyday life. We need to teach people that guns are dangerous and that they should only be used in self-defense. By taking these steps, we can help to prevent accidents like this one from happening again."
OpenAI,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a mini Uzi, which is a powerful submachine gun. It is unfortunate that such incidents occur, and it is a reminder of the important role that gun safety and proper training play in responsible gun ownership. It is always important for gun owners and those handling firearms to use caution and follow strict safety protocols. In the case of the nine-year-old girl, it is clear that she should not have been allowed to handle a weapon of such power and magnitude without proper training and supervision. Incidents like this can also prompt discussions and debates around gun control and regulations. It is crucial for lawmakers to carefully consider the potential risks associated with firearms and to implement responsible measures to reduce the likelihood of such tragedies in the future."
Tsinghua,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a gun for the first time. What a shock. The girl was in a paddy wagon crying, telling her mom that the supervisor was dead. Mom looked at the gun and said ""that's the rifle your father gave you."" She had forgotten the permit requirement. If she had just let her have the gun, there would be no accident. But this is America. This is a gun state. The gun owner was shot, the Superviser was killed. What's the moral of the story? Only an accident. No one should have been there. A better moral would have been that this gun owner should not have been armed and that the supervisor should have been armed. But you don't see that. No one thinks that. It's an accident, so everyone is going to feel good. And everyone is going to buy a gun. Maybe we should make an exception for the people who own guns. They are more responsible than anyone else. This is not just a case of self defense, it's an excuse for mass murder. A 12 year old shoots 50 people at a school. How can we blame the gun? I would say that the child has a mental problem and should not be allowed to own a gun. But I don't think that. I think the gun was used to commit a mass murder. It's the same thing with this girl. Her mother was afraid that she would hurt herself or someone else. So she put the gun in a safe. The gun was never used in a crime, but it was the cause of the death of the supervisor. A girl is not responsible for a death. A gun is responsible for a death. And the gun is not the victim, it's the criminal. No one is defending the gun, they are defending the girl. I see that. But they're defending the gun, not the girl. And this is a huge difference. If I were a gun owner and I shot a man in the head, I would be arrested for murder. It would be my fault, not the gun's fault. So this girl is not responsible for the death of the supervisor. She had no way of knowing that the gun would be used to commit a crime. I think she should have known. I think the gun should have been kept in a locked safe. That's not the point. The point is that she shot a supervisor. It's the gun's fault, not hers. So, if I own a gun and I shoot someone, I'm guilty. If I have a gun and it gets stolen, it's my fault. If I keep my gun locked in a safe and the safe gets broken into, I'm still responsible. But if a girl shoots a supervisor, it's the gun's fault. I don't see how you can say that. I think she should be responsible. I think the gun should be responsible. I think the girl should have been in the safe. She should not have had a gun. I think she should have been trained to use a gun. The gun should not have been able to shoot anyone. If I shoot someone, I'm guilty. If a gun shoots someone, it's the gun's fault. If a gun is used to commit a crime, the gun should be responsible. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but there's a law in California that says if you're found guilty of a crime and you own a gun, you can't get a gun license. I don't think this law is fair. If a person is guilty of a crime, shouldn't they have to give up their gun? Yes. But that's the law. If you own a gun and you shoot someone, you should be arrested. If you own a gun and it gets stolen, you should be arrested. If you keep your gun locked in a safe and the safe gets broken into, you should be arrested. But if a girl shoots a supervisor, it's the gun's fault. I don't see how you can say that. I think she should be responsible. I think the gun should be responsible. I think the girl should have been in the safe. She should not have had a gun. I think she should have been trained to use a gun. The gun should not have been able to shoot anyone. If I shoot someone, I'm guilty. If a gun shoots someone, it's the gun's fault. If a gun is used to commit a crime, the gun should be responsible."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a 22 caliber rifle! Within minutes of the shooting, her father had climbed up to shoot his daughter in order that she not suffer for eternity as he imagined God did when He punished His children by taking away their loved ones (Matt 18:7). This is what happens with firearms training; you are bound sooner or later teach your kids how dangerous they can be because everyone who buys them does so ignorantly thinking ""it"" won't happen if it has never happened before now."" I wish someone would explain just why people keep buying these things? As George Carlin said many years ago on David Letterman show...""give me liberty...or give us death."" This message we must get across loud clear!!!!!"
BigScience,cmv-43,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a homemade replica.22 pistol. Yes, I know it's not the same as a real weapon, but it is enough to make you wonder about what else they are doing in some of these schools that may cause a worse accidents or even death if handled incorrectly... I am glad this happened because like other cases, more people were finally speaking out against this practice. (For those who don't follow the media closely with regard to guns, check out BBC news.) Apparently she went up to an older teenage boy (who also had been shooting) and told him he should put down his rifle....but apparently didn't understand how to operate the trigger properly...so she hit her own head on it instead! She has since undergone surgery for a broken eye socket due to being struck by the bullet exiting from above her left eyebrow Ouch! How sad then, although so many kids nowadays seem determined to be violent thugs, the lack of basic survival skills amongst our youth unfortunately does result in tragedies such as this one - when someone takes (or shoots) aimless and loses control over their actions and gets hurt or killed. That being said though: Since the introduction of semi-automatic weapons into civilian use 40 years ago; have we come any closer to eliminating high schoolpupil shootings? And yet somehow, despite all evidence pointing towards them becoming less prevalent, we keep hearingreading reports every time something happens often similar stories all over again!! What gives??? It seems obvious to me now that most incidents stem from a mix of negligence and criminality (and sometimes even both). In my opinion however, simply banning automatic rifles makes little sense unless we first address this very issue of ""survival skills"" among younger generations. And while I'm sure you've already done your homework on the topic, I'd love to hear your thoughts here too especially since I've become increasingly interested myself after reading several articles related to this subject.... It's worth noting though...that many parents feel that allowing children access to firearms contributes positively to serious crime rates within society... ...especially given recent events involving adult killers using handguns to commit crimes (e.g., Orlando nightclub massacre), and others taking knives, hammers etc to fight each other... (see, e.g.;... So perhaps limiting access to firearms would be appropriate regardless of whether carrying potentially lethal items around campus will impact crime rates within the community overall...? It really comes down to personal choice responsibility. Some believe the presence of fire arms will discourage criminals from committing crimes; us citizens want protection and peace. Others think it compromises public safety and is unnecessary. Those two sides aren't going away just because we ban automatic weapons."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number who are talkers on TV, especially with a new book out like ""Bushwhacked"" by Paul Krugman...I just think it's really odd that we're talking so much more than ever before and still not having any meaningful change at all."""
PaLM,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to: - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in business - increase the number of women in leadership positions I feel a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I'm glad that people are working to create more opportunities for women in these fields. On the other hand, I'm frustrated that these efforts are even necessary. I think it's important to remember that women are just as capable as men in these fields. We have the same intelligence, the same skills, and the same drive to succeed. The only difference is that we've historically been held back by discrimination and prejudice. That's why I'm so supportive of efforts to increase the number of women in these fields. It's not about giving women an unfair advantage. It's about leveling the playing field so that women have the same opportunities as men. I also think it's important to remember that increasing the number of women in these fields is not just about making things fair. It's also about making the world a better place. When women are represented in positions of power, they bring different perspectives and experiences to the table. This can lead to better decision-making and more innovative solutions to problems. In addition, when women see other women succeeding in these fields, it inspires them to believe that they can do the same. This can lead to a positive cycle of increased representation and achievement. So, while I understand that some people may be skeptical of efforts to increase the number of women in these fields, I believe that these efforts are essential for creating a more just and equitable world. Here are some specific ways that you can help to increase the number of women in these fields: - Support organizations that are working to promote women in STEM, politics, and business. - Mentor young women who are interested in these fields. - Speak out against sexism and discrimination in these fields. - Hire more women for leadership positions in your own company or organization. Every little bit helps. By working together, we can create a world where women are equally represented in all fields."
LLAMA,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in management - I can't help wondering why these people don't just get a life. It's called freedom of choice. Women can choose to do whatever they want. If they are choosing not to do something - well, it's a free country. People can choose not to do things. They are allowed to. There's no law against it. That's the meaning of ""freedom of choice."" If you tell people what they are allowed to do - then it isn't freedom of choice. It's all very well saying things like ""a career in X will be good for you,"" but people don't want to do things just because they are good for them. They want to do things because they will enjoy doing them. It's also all very well saying things like ""more women are needed in X,"" but that's not a reason for any particular woman to do X. If there are lots of women in X - I don't think that means that women should be attracted to X. I think it means that there's something about X that makes it attractive to women. I don't think that something is ""good for them."" I think it's something they enjoy. If you want to increase the number of women in X - you should try to make X more attractive. You shouldn't try to make women do things because you think it's good for them. That's just condescending. For example, if you think that more women should be in management, then you should try to make management more attractive to women. You shouldn't try to make women want to do management. If you make management more attractive to women - then some women will want to do management. If you tell women that they should do management - then they probably won't do it. The people who campaign to get women to do X are effectively saying that women are idiots. They are saying that women are doing the wrong things. They are saying that women are not doing the things that they ought to be doing. They are saying that women should do things that they don't want to do. I think that women are not idiots. I think that women do things because they want to do them. I think that women are allowed to do what they want to do. I think that women are allowed to choose their careers. I think that women are allowed to choose how they spend their time. I think that it's ridiculous for people to say things like ""more women should do X."" I think that it's ridiculous for people to try to get women to do X. I think that it's ridiculous for people to try to get women to do things that they don't want to do. I think that it's ridiculous for people to tell women that they should do things because they are good for them. I think that if you want women to do X then you should try to make X attractive to them. You shouldn't try to make them do it.

OpenAI,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in other fields that are traditionally male-dominated, I feel both hopeful and discouraged at the same time. Hopeful, because I believe that increasing diversity in any field is essential for progress and innovation. Discouraged, because it often seems like progress is slow and there are still many barriers that prevent women from advancing in these fields. What can we do to speed up the pace of change and make these fields more inclusive for women?"
Tsinghua,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in the workforce - the topic of ""male privilege"" is always raised. But that is just so dismissive and dismissive of the complexities of gender, and it ignores the fact that some men have a lot of privilege and some men have very little privilege. You know? And you know that there are men who have no privilege and women who have a lot of privilege. So what we need to do is we need to recognize that there is a privilege issue and we need to figure out how to move towards a system that actually does privilege women. Not privilege one group of people and oppress another group of people. We need to create a system that does privilege everyone. But that is so much easier said than done. Because, for example, when I go to a political debate, I don't have the same privileges as most of the other men. And the thing that we don't talk about is that, okay, so I'm not privileged. What are the other ways that I'm privileged? You know? I mean, I think I'm privileged in that I'm white, right? But that's kind of a joke, right? I mean, I'm privileged in that I'm white. So what are the other ways that I'm privileged? You know? I'm privileged in that I was born to a woman who was wealthy and had the resources to give me a very good education.

Human,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in positions of power - increase the number of women that are firefighters or police I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve. The current approach is ""forcing"" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc. As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways: - They involve so-called ""positive discrimination,"" which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment. - They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. The only benefits I see is that ""artificially"" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less ""unusual"" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.

EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that: - Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less ""threatening"" to other women. - Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination. - Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it. I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters,...) would also benefit from having more women. Some of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are: uYxoque: uwaldrop02: uclairebones: uyesthatsright: Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

BigScience,cmv-44,"Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of men and women on boards, council committees and so forth - it's always a little bit like when you hear politicians say they are going to cut taxes for all people just because it helps their political career. And then every time we have an election there is this big push to get more female politicians elected and eventually that happens but by then there's not much difference between the two groups other than maybe one has got slightly better hair than another. So my question is: Isn't it simply a matter of breaking down these barriers which keep some kinds of individuals from getting into certain jobs? I'm sure that's true, yeah. But I'm still puzzled as well though. I mean if you're asking why do some women find themselves at home with children rather than working outside the house being paid the same wage as someone who works inside? And why does some woman choose to go back home after having kids whereas others don't Because society doesn't force them to either work outside the house or stay at home raising children. But what I've noticed is that those things aren't really enforced anymore too heavily. So people can be very happy at work regardless of whether they're male or female. You know, I think gender discrimination exists and certainly it's something I'd want to reduce until it gets completely eliminated, but how do you eliminate it without putting up walls around people's minds? Right? Because obviously we're in a globalised world where communication means that seats in Parliament can change hands quite easily across different countries. There are plenty of guys doing exactly the stuff you've described here today who come out and talk about sexism within organisations, it's only articles written by males catching your attention. Do you believe this sort of information will reach young girls who may not be aware of this kind of thing happening even though they're educated enough to read English newspapers? We've had lots of letters from younger students saying they've never heard about sexual harassment before coming to college, right? Not at university level. No, no, it's hard enough to convince somebody who hasn't experienced anything wrong nowadays. (Interviewer:) In Australia and in England, we've seen huge campaigns promoting equality in Britain making it compulsory for companies to disclose any forms of discrimination against staff members. Will similar campaigns happen in India? (Mani Ratnam:) We didn't see that campaign mentioned anywhere. It was actually made publically known recently through India's biggest newspaper reports that, sometimes employers were worried about undermining the culture of silence. The Hindu newspaper said, ""There could be lawsuits for breaching confidentiality agreements."" It's a peculiar way of thinking, isn't it? There's nothing illegal in ensuring employees' safety and security. The fact remains though that whatever the legislation says must be followed, otherwise it's not lawful. Yes absolutely. People need to understand both sides of such situations. They can't avoid scrutiny. What happens often is when an organisation starts looking after its reputation, it might try and suppress evidence of human rights violations internally, particularly among migrant workers. It would be good if the government looked closely at employment practices especially with contractors etc., because they rarely abide by welfare rules. This needs to be checked carefully. Whether it's voluntary disclosure of misconduct or criminal prosecution depends to a large extent upon management's attitude towards compliance. In London, you saw this lovely example from Barclays Bank. When the bank admitted to paying off tenants who'd been evicted unfairly, they immediately replaced the head of risk control. Here in Delhi, you cannot expect anything beyond ethical guidelines issued by the union ministry, which are fairly weak. Most of us would agree that this practice of non-disclosure should stop now. Well obviously you wouldn't ask me to name names. Certain aspects of businesses such as hiring policies, field visits, escorting customers and clients round premises, advertising roles available, conducting job interviews, bribes given to heads of recruitment agencies, so forth, none of these details would ever appear in the media. However, whistleblowers preferred to remain anonymous despite receiving threats... If an employee discovers issues related to workplace violence, he may report his complaint directly to HR, requesting protection measures against him... if necessary. However, reporting cases involving complaints of non-compliance to the labour department, according to regulations, is prohibited. Are you surprised that most senior managers are reluctant to take action on their own initiative? Are they afraid of losing face, perhaps? That's exactly correct. One reason behind firms continuing this shameful business model lies in the fear of loss of image, social responsibility, bad press and ultimately corporate viability. Then again, many renowned brands employ thousands of staff in India, yet few of them share stories about abuse reported by their former employees. Unless there are signs pointing clearly that company behaviour is seriously flawed, investors become increasingly hesitant in providing financing through stock market credit lines (see Financial Times article). Do Indian authorities have plans to bring such acts of corruption to light publicly and impose punishment on perpetrators once and for all?

PaLM,cmv-45,"Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I think it’s worth putting out there for people to see what they think. I’m not a professional writer or anything, but I’ve been thinking about this idea for a while and I wanted to see what other people thought. Here goes: The Problem with the Modern World The modern world is a strange place. On the one hand, we have more technology and conveniences than ever before. We can communicate with people all over the world instantly, we can travel to far-off places with ease, and we have access to an endless amount of information at our fingertips. On the other hand, the modern world is also full of problems. We are facing a climate crisis, a political crisis, and a mental health crisis. We are more divided than ever before, and we are constantly bombarded with negative news and information. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the problems in the world. It’s easy to feel like there’s no point in trying to make a difference. But I believe that we can make a difference. I believe that we can create a better world. But first, we need to understand the problem. We need to understand why the modern world is so messed up. The Root of the Problem The root of the problem is that we have lost touch with our humanity. We have become too focused on material possessions, on wealth, and on power. We have forgotten what it means to be kind, to be compassionate, and to be loving. We have created a society that is based on competition and individualism. We are constantly told that we need to be better than everyone else, that we need to achieve more, that we need to have more. This is a recipe for disaster. When we are constantly striving to be better than everyone else, we are inevitably going to fail. And when we fail, we feel bad about ourselves. We feel like we are not good enough. This leads to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. We need to create a society that is based on cooperation and community. We need to learn to value each other for who we are, not for what we have. We need to learn to be kind, compassionate, and loving. The Solution The solution to the problems in the modern world is simple: we need to change our ways. We need to become more mindful of our impact on the planet. We need to be more compassionate towards each other. We need to be more loving. It won’t be easy. There will be challenges along the way. But it’s worth it. We can create a better world, a world where everyone is happy and healthy, a world where everyone feels loved. How Can We Make a Difference? There are many ways that we can make a difference in the world. Here are a few ideas:  Reduce our carbon footprint. We can do this by driving less, walking or biking more, and using less energy.  Eat less meat. Meat production is a major contributor to climate change. We can help reduce our impact by eating less meat and more plant-based foods.  Be more compassionate towards each other. We can do this by listening to each other, understanding each other’s perspectives, and being kind to each other.  Be more loving. We can do this by expressing our love for our family and friends, and by helping those in need. These are just a few ideas. There are many other ways that we can make a difference in the world. The important thing is to start somewhere. Every little bit helps. Conclusion The modern world is a strange place. It’s full of problems, but it’s also full of potential. We can create a better world, a world where everyone is happy and healthy, a world where everyone feels loved. It won’t be easy, but it’s worth it."

Human,cmv-45,"Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily. I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates. You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary I'll continue on later. Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people I want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating. What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65. What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be 25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but I see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests. How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution I think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone. Now another thing I would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children. I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized. This is all I can think of for now, if I remember more of my plan I will post. So reddit users, change my view."

LLAMA,cmv-45,"Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I'm not particularly looking for discussion of the merits or lack thereof. I'm looking for an honest answer to the question, ""How can we do this?"" The other side of that question is ""Why should we do this?"" I've been told that the proposed law in the second paragraph is unenforceable and unconstitutional, to which I responded, ""Why?"" I was then told, ""Because it's unenforceable and unconstitutional."" I'm looking for some actual reasons why. The problem I'm trying to solve is in the first paragraph. I'm open to other ideas, but I think this would work. The way I see it, the biggest problem with the American educational system is that it is a cookie cutter system. It is designed to educate all students using the same methods, at the same pace, on the same topics, and to the same standards. This is a poor way to teach students because they have vastly different learning styles and abilities. Some students are capable of learning through lecture, and some aren't. Some students have problems with focus and need a more interactive way to learn. Some students need to work with their hands and get to experience whatever it is they're learning about. The American educational system is designed to educate students on a variety of topics, but it is only one of many ways to learn. Learning a trade, becoming an apprentice, working in a field, or any number of other methods are as good, if not better, ways of learning than the current system. Education is a personal issue, and should be treated as such. It should be the choice of the student, or their parentguardian if the student is under 18, which method of education is best. Therefore, I propose the following: A law should be passed stating that no child in America should be required to attend public or private school. Home schooling, apprenticeships, or any other method of learning would be permitted. However, in order to receive funding from the federal, state, and local governments, the following requirements must be met: 1. The student must be able to read and write. 2. The student must be able to perform basic math. 3. The student must have a basic knowledge of history and civics. The student's parents or guardian may teach the student, or they may choose another teacher, such as a private tutor or a teacher at a private school. The government may fund these teachers at the same rate as public school teachers, or they may choose to pay a lump sum to the parents or guardian. Students who are unable to learn on their own or who do not have parents or guardians to teach them will be provided for by the government. I have no problem with this proposal. I don't see what's unconstitutional or unenforceable about it. I don't think you're doing anything illegal, but it's a logistical nightmare. Here's why: -The US constitution gives the Federal government no power to run schools. It is up to the states. -In order for this plan to work, it would need to be funded at the Federal level, otherwise you are giving all of the control and power to the states. -Federal funding can only be guaranteed for states that accept Federal laws. If you make a federal law, then states that don't accept it don't get the funding. -Some states can't afford their own education system, and rely on Federal funding. -If states are given the option to allow this, but not be required to accept it, they will not accept it. -If states are given the option to allow this, and they are required to accept it, then they will not accept any Federal funding for education. -If states are required to accept this, but are not required to accept Federal funding, then they will not accept any Federal funding. -If states are required to accept this, and they are required to accept Federal funding, then this is the only thing the Federal government can require the states to do. -Federal funding in the form of a lump sum to the parents or guardians will be much less than funding in the form of paying teachers, and will not be enough to sustain most students. -Requiring the parents or guardians to teach the student will not be sufficient for the vast majority of students. -The students that do not have parents or guardians"
Tsinghua,cmv-46,"before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that it is true for a few cases. I have not tried to prove it and I am not even sure if it is true. I am not even trying to justify this statement. I am simply saying that it is possible to create such a condition in practice. My comments are not meant to be a criticism of the question but simply a critique of my own assumptions. A: As a ZF theorist I don't see a way of doing this without being forced to drop the axiom of choice, and therefore of doing mathematics. I see a possible way of doing this in a universe where the axiom of choice is false, but it seems like you would have to sacrifice a lot to do this. Let me start by stating that my interpretation of the problem is that we are trying to find a pair of ordinals such that f (a) ext{tp} (a) and f (b) ext{tp} (b) for all a and b in this pair. We want to prove that such a pair exists. In this case, we want to prove that there exists a pair of ordinals a, b such that f (a) ext{tp} (a) and f (b) ext{tp} (b) for all a and b in this pair. By the Axiom of Choice we can do this if we have a pair of ordinals a, b such that f (a) ext{tp} (a) and f (b) ext{tp} (b) for all a and b in this pair. We can prove that such a pair exists in a universe where the axiom of choice fails by constructing a partition of the natural numbers. Let a0 0 and let a{n1} sup{ak: k n}. Now let b0 0 and let b{n1} sup{bk: k n}. We will now show that these two sequences have the desired properties. First we claim that ext{tp} (an) ext{tp} (bn) for all n. This is easy to see since the only element of the partition that can possibly occur in both sequences is a0. But then we know that a0 0 and b0 0 since a0 sup{ak: k 0} and b0 sup{bk: k 0}. So in this case ext{tp} (a0) ext{tp} (b0) which means that ext{tp} (an) ext{tp} (bn) for all n. Next we claim that f (an) ext{tp} (an) for all n. This is easy to see since the only element of the partition that can possibly occur in both sequences is a0. But then we know that a0 0 and b0 0 since a0 sup{ak: k 0} and b0 sup{bk: k 0}. So in this case f (a0) ext{tp} (a0) which means that f (an) ext{tp} (an) for all n. Now we claim that f (bn) ext{tp} (bn) for all n. This is easy to see since the only element of the partition that can possibly occur in both sequences is b0. But then we know that b0 0 and a0 0 since a0 sup{ak: k 0} and b0 sup{bk: k 0}. So in this case f (b0) ext{tp} (b0) which means that f (bn) ext{tp} (bn) for all n. So we now have a pair of ordinals a, b such that f (a) ext{tp} (a) and f (b) ext{tp} (b) for all a and b in this pair."

The problem with trying to predict the future in PHP, as I've seen a lot of people do, is: You end up having some kind of meta-programming language where your intentions are all mixed together and hard to follow It becomes harder for others to understand what you're doing when they read about the code. This was actually brought up by Anonytawesome on another question regarding an unintended chance execution: Is there any way we can separate our intentions from the actual results? I'm writing a script that might execute some arbitrary SQL statement if certain conditions aren't met but I'd love a better description than something like: mysqlquery A: Avoid using ""feeling"" here.

After watching the DP all I can think is what the hell happened to the anime? I am not saying that it was not good but it was a far cry from the anime that I grew up watching. It was very childish and not at all serious. There was no substance to the story line. All the characters were completely different to what they were in the past and the whole storyline was very shallow and had no depth to it whatsoever. It was like they were trying to start again from scratch instead of continuing from where it was left off. I don't even think that the Gym Leaders that I grew up with were the same people in the DP. I understand that a lot of people do not like the DP because of the main character and all the things that have changed in the Pokemon anime but this was not my problem. I have to say that I was actually very pleased with Ash's new character. I thought he was very funny and I liked his personality. I also liked Dawn and Brock. I thought that Brock was very different but I was OK with it because I have to admit that he was pretty funny and was a very entertaining character. I did not really have much of a problem with Team Galactic or any of the other new characters. My only issue was the fact that the whole anime had changed so dramatically and that the stories were not as deep as they were in the past. I felt that the story line lacked depth and that it was not serious or emotional as it had been in the past. I felt that the whole storyline was very shallow and childish. I felt that the whole anime had become very childish and the stories lacked any sort of depth. I would just like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my views based on my experience of watching the DP. I have just finished watching the DP and I have to say that it has left me in a state of utter confusion, despair and devastation.

Human,cmv-47,"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to the next news story and give the subject little other thought. I think that watching these videos would have a much greater impact on people and make them more likely to do something to help. Personally, if I watch videos like this I feel sick and it disturbs me for about half a week. I cannot forget about them easily. Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly. Secondly I am sure some people cannot visually imagine how horrific these events are. Being exposed to footage of it will be a shock and a wake up call to how bad life can be for some people. This in turn will make them more likely to take action. I will make it plain that I do not think people should be viewing these sorts of videos for entertainment of any kind. Finally it seems I am not alone, [this article] may help you understand my argument better than I can express it. EDIT: Some of the responses have made me realise that what I am suggesting would have different effects on different people and as such viewing these videos may not always cause people to act in a positive way as it has with me.

PaLM,cmv-47,"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to whatever other news is coming in. The sad thing is that this happens so often that we've become desensitized to it. We've heard so many stories of people being executed that we don't even bat an eye anymore. But what if we stopped and really thought about what these executions mean? What if we put ourselves in the shoes of the people who are being executed? What if we thought about the families who are left behind? I know that it's hard to imagine what it would be like to be on death row. To know that you're going to be executed in a few days or weeks. To think about the last few moments of your life. It's a terrifying thought. And it's even harder to imagine what it would be like to be the family of someone who has been executed. To lose a loved one in such a violent and final way. To have to live with the pain and grief of knowing that your loved one was killed by the state. These are the stories that we need to hear more about. These are the stories that we need to think about. These are the stories that we need to remember. We need to remember that these executions are not just numbers. They are not just statistics. They are the stories of real people. People who had families and friends. People who had hopes and dreams. People who were loved. We need to remember that these executions are a tragedy. They are a stain on our country's history. They are something that we should be ashamed of. And we need to do something about it. We need to stand up and say no to the death penalty. We need to let our voices be heard. We need to make a difference. We can't just stand by and let these executions happen. We need to do something."
BigScience,cmv-47,"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move right along their life's path. We are told repeatedly by government institutions such as schools and churches not to question authority or take sides in politics, we tell our kids they shouldn't be too critical because ""politics"" can get them killed. My dad was born during World War II and never had a chance to hear what communism really meant - he didn't know anything outside his family. He supported my mommy politically but he never talked about himself being against America, just so long as she stayed safe from those Communists who followed Stalin around everywhere trying to murder her. America is now victims of a dirty war waged by President Trump and others like him (and some willing servants) who believe they can bring down any regime even if they kill thousands of innocent people. And yes, this sounds similar to fascist dictatorships across Europe in the 1930s - and there may well be parallels between Trump and Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Salazar, Ceausescu, Pol Pot, Mao Tse-tung, Pinochet, and other despots - but it's also different; while most European regimes were mostly left-wing totalitarian regimes with a social-democratic veneer and appeared to accept democratic norms, American leaders tend to reject democracy altogether and favor authoritarian rule over traditional political parties, which make up one branch of government. (See: QAnon) The control exerted by the elites both within power structures (think politicians, corporations, media) and above them (think military, intelligence agencies, lobbyists), has always been great despite its flaws and abuses. But today things appear more extreme than ever before. In 1984 George Orwell wrote an essay called ""The Rebel Without A Cause"" where he presents us with three types of society: According to the essay, there will eventually come ""a time at which rebellion will no longer be possible under existing conditions. The old order - whatever your faults - remains intact. It is impossible for you 'to turn back' ... You cannot fight against a system without fighting yourself into madness... There would soon be nothing left to rebel against except ourselves .... Most men are selfishly contented to live in a world governed by unreasonable rules laid out by equally irrational beings ... Still less secure seems the prospect of escaping tyranny upon earth ... More dangerous still must seem a struggle against tyrants in heaven.... In any event however much better off you might become personally, you learn sooner or later that you can't help having lived amidst evils ... These quickly awaken feelings akin to envy and resentment towards individuals far removed from me .... Even a lover whose eyes reflect all that I am capable of loving becomes after a few years very ordinary, almost contemptible in comparison."""

It's important to raise awareness about these injustices, but it's equally important to take action and advocate for change. One way to take action is to support organizations that work towards abolishing the death penalty and advocating for criminal justice reform. You can also educate yourself and others on the flaws and biases within our current criminal justice system. In addition, you can contact your elected officials and urge them to support measures that promote rehabilitation and reduce the use of the death penalty. It's important to use our voices and demand change in order to create a more just and humane society."
OpenAI,cmv-48,"""Normal"" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states of being that are considered typical or common, such as having two arms and two legs, being able to see and hear, and possessing a certain level of intelligence and emotional capacity. However, it is important to recognize that there is a wide range of individual differences within what is considered normal, and that these differences should be respected and celebrated. Additionally, we should be cautious about labeling certain people or groups as abnormal or deviant simply because they do not fit within our preconceived notions of what is typical or average."
PaLM,cmv-48,"""Normal"" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a 'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various 'Normal' states of being. But what exactly is 'Normal'? Is it the average height, weight, and intelligence of a human being? Is it the ability to speak and reason? Or is it something more ephemeral, like a sense of self and purpose? The answer to this question is not easy, and it is one that has been debated by philosophers and scientists for centuries. But one thing is for sure: there is no one definition of 'Normal' that applies to everyone. What is 'Normal' for one person may be considered 'abnormal' for another. And what is 'Normal' at one point in time may not be 'Normal' at another. This is why it is important to be open-minded and tolerant of people who are different from us. Just because someone does not conform to our definition of 'Normal' does not mean that they are wrong or bad. They are simply different. In fact, it is our differences that make us unique and special. They are what make the world a more interesting place. So next time you meet someone who is different from you, don't be afraid to embrace their differences. Learn from them and let them teach you about the world. You might just be surprised at what you learn."

So, the'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man. This means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not'Normal'.

LLAMA,cmv-48,"""Normal"" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states of being, according to what the'Standard' is. The'Normal' could be defined as the most common state of being, or the most desirable state of being. In the context of sexuality, the word 'Normal' is used in a variety of ways, with the implication that there is a particular state of being (or a particular standard of behaviour) that is preferred. The most common, and most acceptable of these states of being, is 'Normal' heterosexuality. The definition of heterosexuality is often left out of this debate. Heterosexuality is a term used in describing a state of being. To define this term, we must first ask: What is sex? Sex is defined as being the biological state of being male or female. What then is heterosexuality? Heterosexuality, by definition, is the sexual attraction between a male and a female. (It is important to note that the word'Hetero' means'different'.) When we apply the definition of heterosexuality to the definition of normal, we can see that heterosexuality is not'Normal' in the sense that it is not the most common state of being. In fact, there are many different states of sexual being, each of which occurs in nature. For example, homosexuality, which is the sexual attraction between two people of the same sex, and bisexuality, which is the sexual attraction between people of different sexes. The best way to define the word 'Normal' in the context of sexuality is to say that it is the state of being that we have been taught to believe is the most desirable. We have been taught this through various media, such as movies and television shows, books, magazines, and the internet, as well as our friends and family members. We have been taught that heterosexuality is'Normal', and that homosexuality is not. The problem with this is that it is a lie. The lie is that heterosexuality is more desirable than homosexuality or bisexuality. The lie is that one state of being is superior to another. In reality, there is no difference between the various states of sexual being. There is no difference between heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality. The truth is that people are people, regardless of their sexuality. Regardless of our sexual preference, we all have hopes and dreams, we all have friends and family members, we all have jobs, and we all have goals that we hope to achieve in life. We all have feelings, and we all deserve to be treated with respect. We should all be able to have the freedom to be ourselves without the fear of being judged or ridiculed. We should be able to love the person of our choosing without being looked down on or discriminated against. The only thing that we should be judged on is how we treat other people. What matters is how you treat other people, not your sexuality."
Tsinghua,cmv-48,"""Normal"" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states that exist within the spectrum of 'normal' human behavior. We can also be sure that these states of'Normal' will change. For instance, a child's'Normal' will be very different from a child's'Normal' a year later. The more mature the child, the more'Normal' will be different. A child's'Normal' may be very different from an adult's'Normal'. These states of'Normal' will also change with age. However, the'Normal' of a child is not the'Normal' of an adult. What we call'Normal' changes with time. What we call'Normal' will also change over time, with various events. A person may or may not become an adult at birth. If the child does become an adult, we can be sure that the adult's'Normal' will be different from the child's'Normal'. What we call'Normal' will also change over time, with various events. The reason we believe that the term'Normal' is so useful is that it allows us to easily understand how people's'Normal' change over time. We can't say for sure that'Normal' will change over time, but it seems pretty likely. In other words, if we can agree on a standard, it is easy to compare one's behavior to that standard. If we can agree on a standard, it is easy to compare one's behavior to that standard. It is possible that we may not agree on the standard. For instance, some people may believe that'Normal' is more or less based on one's appearance, or one's socioeconomic status. Others may believe that'Normal' is more or less based on one's intellect, or one's age. Others may believe that'Normal' is more or less based on one's body type, or one's religion. Others may believe that'Normal' is more or less based on one's profession, or one's wealth. Definitions of'Normal' can differ based on how we define our terms. For instance,'Normal' may be defined in terms of the average. 'Normal' may be defined in terms of the standard. 'Normal' may be defined in terms of the average. 'Normal' may be defined in terms of the standard. It may be that the average person is the'Normal' person. It may be that the standard person is the'Normal' person. It may be that the average person is the'Normal' person. It may be that the standard person is the'Normal' person. The average person is more likely to be'Normal' than the standard person. The average person is more likely to be'Normal' than the standard person. However, we can't know for sure. There are many possible definitions of'Normal'. 2.

The assumptions behind the definition of'Normal' are important. These assumptions are the foundation of the definition of'Normal'. The assumptions behind the definition of'Normal' are important. These assumptions are the foundation of the definition of'Normal'. 1.1. If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. The first assumption is that'Normal' is based on some kind of'Standard'. For instance, we might assume that'Normal' is based on the average. 'Normal' may be based on the standard. 'Normal' may be based on the average. 'Normal' may be based on the standard. If'Normal' is based on the average, then it is true that'If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. If'Normal' is based on the standard, then it is true that'If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. If'Normal' is based on the average, then it is true that'If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. If'Normal' is based on the standard, then it is true that'If one thing is'Normal', then another thing is'Normal'. However, we can't know for sure that'Normal' is based on the average. We can't know for sure that'Normal' is based on the standard. We can't know for sure that'Normal' is based on the average."
Tsinghua,cmv-49,"My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother came in and chastised her daughter, saying that she would never make it in life and that she would be an N and should stay home and mind her own business. My girlfriend was so upset she could hardly get the words out of her mouth. ""What the hell is wrong with you people?"" she yelled at the mother. My girlfriend is not a racist, but I know her mother is, and I'm afraid she might bring that kind of mentality into her home. I'm afraid she might come to America and think that the US is full of racists, and that's not the case at all. She may even be influenced by her own friends. I know it's not right to assume that all white people are racists, but I'm afraid she might be the first one to start with the stereotypes. mroveralls This happens all the time. Here in the UK, I've heard many racist comments from non-whites about white people, including ""you're all a bunch of racists."" A lot of it comes from ignorant parents. There's a lot of bullying of kids of color, and often the perpetrator is white. I've also had teachers and other adults be racist towards me. I was an ESL student in my high school, and I didn't know any better. dghughes I think that's why it is important to make a distinction between being racist and being a racist. I think you can be racist without being a racist. There are some racists who are not necessarily bigots. Some racists have friends who are not racists. mroveralls It's also important to recognize that it is a privilege to be able to make that distinction. If I don't, then I am part of the problem. It is only when I realize I am a part of the problem that I can then make a change. I would rather be racist and a bigot than be ignorant. gfodor I don't think this is a ""casual racist"" I think this is an angry one. If you have never lived in a majority-minority country, you have no idea how many white people will treat you with nothing but hostility and disdain because of that fact. I have lived in two countries where I am not a native speaker of the language, and I have had numerous people, white and otherwise, tell me I am not welcome because I'm a foreigner. They may not be consciously racist, but they are nonetheless uneducated and angry, and will act accordingly. I would rather be a bigot than an ignorant one. chriswot If you have never lived in a majority-minority country, you have no idea how many white people will treat you with nothing but hostility and disdain because of that fact.

This is a racist post. I'm not denying that. But to say it's uneducated and angry is to reduce racism to its worst aspects. I'm sorry but that is the definition of racism. It's to simplify a complex issue into a one dimensional situation. gfodor I would not say I'm missing the point. I don't deny that this is a racist post. I think it's an angry one, but not necessarily a racist one. Racism and bigotry are bad things. I'm a bigot because I'm angry, but not because I'm racist.

Human,cmv-49,"My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother insists he doesn't act up at home, but the teacher has called her multiple times about her son's behavior. She can't take away recess from kids. She can only send them to the office for 20 minutes at a time. She's not allowed to take pictures or videos of the kids (but she showed us picturesvideos of the kid that day breaking into drawers, throwing stuff, yelling, rolling up carpets, etc). Attempts to discuss the kid with admins are shrugged off. The teacher is very upset because the other kids have complained that they can't learn and some are beginning to follow suit of the shitty kid. I know this is one example, but her school isn't even among the worst, and it isn't as if teachers inability to control students, despite their wishes to, is surprising. We've all heard about terrible parents, helicopters, complaining about grades etc. I've had the fortune of going to private schools my entire life (though perhaps that is more due to growing up in one of the worst public school districts in the country). One of the effects of that is that they could discipline you as they saw fit. If you acted shitty, you missed recess, had to call your parents, had to write on the chalkboard, had to stay in the office, got yelled at, etc. Public schools, of course, are another matter and it seems like teachers, the very people entrusted with educating the future, are powerless to do their jobs properly. So tell me, is our educational system that fucked because of shitty parents, shitty kids, and shitty administrators, or is it really not that bad? CMV.

After trying several times, the kid finally identified the color ""Gray"" as ""Gray."" That's the only color she knew. That's what prostitution and drugs can do to your kids, folks. I bet the kid is a total , too. You're such a . I bet the kid is a total , too.:lol: Okay, I'm going to be honest here. I'm not one to judge, but I don't know how I feel about this. I mean, it's a good thing for these women to have options, but a very bad thing for them to be doing this. I'd much rather see them doing this than being on welfare, though. I don't care what they do as long as they're not hurting anyone. If they want to use a crack pipe, go ahead. If they want to have unprotected sex with 500 men, go ahead. They're going to do it anyway, so why not make a little money off of it? Someone should have a Sperm bankstorage facility. They could pay 100 for every ounce of sperm. It would save millions on welfare, and the women could make money. They're going to do it anyway, so why not make a little money off of it? That's a point. BTW, you're my idol."
BigScience,cmv-49,"My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother had died some months ago and they were visiting from out of state when the child's father got his job transferred to another school district, so their daughter was now living with relatives she's never met. He brought this child into the family knowing nothing about themhis wife or childrenand didn't want anything to do with her until she reached elementary school age. The problem he declared his son faced was that all the other parents would sit down together at recess time and talk over each parentteacher meeting for three hours while their child sat there alone begging to be let play or socialize! And even then, it wasn't always easy getting him involved as everything else on the agenda was too important! As I started thinking about why this particular set-up seemed particularly troubledI really think that's probably more than just her not wanting to get too close before we sent her off to kindergarten. (She has two brothers in high school trying to make friends.) I realized its forced separation between both families left no contact, much less communication during these times (I suspect there's been no phone calls either). There simply isn't enough time to see what needs are being addressed by teachers; especially if one works full-time outside the house but spends most nights working long after everyone asleep. (Although my first thought here was ""no way could anyone in America..."" I'm still wondering how many Americans have such Sunday mornings.) So far I've heard only stories similar to yours I know people whose students call them up late night asking what's going on sometimes: (But also, our own grandchildren stayed overnight every weekend since we divorced and it's worked well, though we did try for a little longer before giving ourselves permission to send them back home after naptime which helped ease said sleep deprivation."
OpenAI,cmv-50,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for why automatics would be better in every situation. However, in certain scenarios, such as heavy urban traffic, automatics can be more convenient and efficient to drive. Additionally, many newer automatic transmissions now offer similar or better fuel efficiency than manual transmissions. Ultimately, both manual and automatic transmissions have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on personal preference and driving needs."
Human,cmv-50,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways. Economy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamicslower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price. Automatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers ""manual shifting"" anyways. I believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more. This leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe: High end 400-500 HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference. And for manual transmission: Old classic imitation cars for the nostalgia? They're plainly under performing now. Whenever I see a Bentley or Benz S550600 coupe, I cringe a bit since they're very obviously not performance based cars. Manual freaks who refuse to own any other cars also seem illogical as hell.

PaLM,cmv-50,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for a manual transmission in modern cars. Automatics are more fuel-efficient, easier to drive, and offer more features than manuals. They're also becoming more and more reliable, so the days of the manual transmission as the ""more reliable"" option are over. Here are some of the reasons why a manual transmission is no longer the best choice for most drivers:  Fuel efficiency: Automatic transmissions are more fuel-efficient than manuals. This is because the transmission can automatically shift to the most efficient gear for the current driving conditions. Manual transmissions, on the other hand, require the driver to manually shift gears, which can lead to wasted fuel.  Ease of driving: Automatic transmissions are easier to drive than manuals. This is because the driver does not have to worry about shifting gears. Automatic transmissions also make it easier to drive in stop-and-go traffic, as the transmission will automatically downshift when the car comes to a stop.  Features: Automatic transmissions offer more features than manuals. These features can include things like cruise control, hill start assist, and paddle shifters. Manual transmissions do not offer these features.  Reliability: Automatic transmissions are becoming more and more reliable. This is due to advances in technology and manufacturing. Manual transmissions, on the other hand, are still more prone to failure than automatic transmissions. Overall, there are few compelling reasons to choose a manual transmission in a modern car. Automatic transmissions are more fuel-efficient, easier to drive, and offer more features than manuals. They're also becoming more and more reliable, so the days of the manual transmission as the ""more reliable"" option are over."
BigScience,cmv-50,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for having an electric car as a primary mode of transportation. A few things about the Porsche Taycan: A) The real reason that Tesla is getting hammered by critics at the moment isn't because they have to do a Porsche build but because their vehicles are too perfect - as far as perfection goes they pretty much scratch every little detail off the list except maybe the ability to self drive without human intervention. They've been so good at this they even let people order them from China where building quality control standards aren't quite up to par here. (For instance one customer reported that his new 2016 Model 3 he bought was missing a panel which led him to contact Tesla - within 24 hours they'd sent another vehicle!) B) If you want pure electric cars then there's no better example than the Taycann or Niro EV (and that's saying something). C) There won't be any shortage of hybrids soon as manufacturers like Toyota and Hyundai make sure their gasoline engines never die on us! D) With regard to battery technology, if you're going electric you've got two choices. You can either go super heavy duty lithium ion batteries capable of storing hundreds of miles worth of energy per charge OR you could choose lighter weight less expensive lead acid packs which store only a bit more but last longer between charges. As it stands ebikes seem to prefer the former while non-electric vehicles such as sedans and pickups favor the latter. E) Even though I'm not an avid fan of the automakers who spend billions developing automobiles whose sole purpose seems to be selling enough fuel-efficient models to keep their lines moving without ever truly understanding what makes consumers tick; however I have some respect for those engineers who strive to produce safer cars, smarter autos and just plain fun machines. Very nice article geoffrey cerulli. There is basically nothing wrong with using your own power source when there is grid failure. However, its sad to hear how the old standard way has become marginalized due to scammer politicians making decisions based purely on political reasons rather than engineering solutions. Its really hard to find someone willing to risk life limb to plug into a directly connected utility wire system during outages unless you're staying somewhere remote. So imagine my surprise when driving across Nevada trying to figure out how to use alternative means like solar panels I agree entirely in terms of charging stations being unreliable especially with the current weather related problems across Europe. But it's also important to realize that with existing systems the majority of times when we can't recharge our batteries we're still able to make cheaper trips with the same amount of time by simply ""driving"" the car around instead of relying on public electricity. Because most folk wouldn't know how to change the modes manually anyway they would rely solely on the battery capacity left after each full charge-discharge cycle as well as the cost of their electricity bill. And given today's world average prices overnight travelers could easily pay 4 euros per kWh to cover all costs including petrol and taxes compared to 1 euro per kwh needed to supply a fully charged battery assuming typical usage rates of 20-30kmday (which again assumes perfectly reliable routes and infrastructure). Perhaps you need to read up on battery chemistry and cell voltage before talking crap about elsewhere... Battery chemistries vary considerably depending on producer and density of cells used in a battery pack. For instance Tesla uses prismatic Li-ion modules whereas Nissan manufactures tubular plates and LG Chem produces cylindrical ones. Each module type offers different advantages e.g. higher safety, increased durability etc. Also high voltages offer greater efficiency and faster charge times hence why newer, bigger Teslas tend to come with 60kWh batteries, pushing top speed down to 150kmh thanks to lower kinetic losses but requiring twice as long refueling sessions. On the other hand smaller Renault Twizy vechicles require 36kWh components delivering 160kmh max speeds but deliver 80 range in 30 minutes! The intro paragraph states clearly that: 'It's now possible via software to adjust motor gear ratios' - and that applies to both Turbocharged and DieselCNG vehicles. Nothing says a diesel engine doesn't work best in 5th gear vs 2nd gear. It sounds like the author should check her facts further, otherwise she may end up spreading misinformation regarding the matter. As regards me complaining about torque being wasted- as opposed to taking advantage thereof in consideration of terrain slope angle?"
Tsinghua,cmv-50,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for why I should own a manual, it's not like they're cheap, and I'm a truck driver, so I'm not going to be using the car on an all-day basis. If I had a manual I'd consider it more of a hobby, but I really don't need it. It's nice to have it, but I'm not going to be taking it on any long trips. I think I have a reasonable argument for why I should own an automatic. What is your argument for why you should own a manual? There are a lot of automatics out there, I don't need to own a manual to have fun driving. I guess I'm just looking for a reason to justify the extra cost. Edited to add: And I do agree that I should own an automatic if I'm going to drive it a lot. A: I would say that there is a certain amount of ""free will"" that comes with driving a manual transmission. I know this is debatable, but I can't help but feel like a manual transmission allows me to drive in a way that is more similar to how I drive on the track. I'm not talking about outright speed or straight line performance, but the overall feel of the car. The clutch pedal is there to control your throttle, and the clutch pedal is there to let you out of a situation that's too tight. A: My experience has been that you don't want to own an automatic. I can't tell you how many times I have driven the auto in my own vehicle. It is always too late when I am driving with it. It is a pain in the butt to shift, and a real pain to change lanes. A manual is much easier to drive. I like driving a manual because it allows me to use the clutch. If I was going to drive a manual, I would drive one with a manual transmission. The manual transmission gives you more control over the car. It is less dangerous. The clutch gives you more control over the car."

It's just that you haven't seen any manuals out in SoCal because most BMW buyers in SoCal don't buy manuals. Last edited by JMR426; 03-28-2017 at 05:24 PM. I've been driving manuals since I was 16. It's a lot more fun to drive a stick. Last edited by M2C; 03-28-2017 at 05:28 PM. Not much of a stick driver, but from what I have been told, in the M2 a manual is actually a lot easier to drive than an automatic. I have no idea if this is true or not though. Also, manuals are cheaper than autos, so you can get more for your money if you go with a manual. It's not a regional thing, but I can tell you that the percentage of manuals in SoCal is probably way less than most other places in the country, even Florida. There is a reason why the only M2s I see around are with manual transmissions, and why the BMW dealers here only have automatic M2s as their loaners (when they have them in stock). Another point. In some of the worst traffic areas in the country, manuals are still very popular. I am talking about places like Chicago and the Northeast. I know Chicago is close to your area, but SoCal traffic is nothing compared to the traffic in the Midwest and the Northeast. Yet, I see a lot of manuals in those areas.

I have an M2 and live in SoCal. I've seen another manual m2 on the road (he pulled up next to me on PCH). I had a 335i for 3 years with the DCT, and I loved it. I sold the car because I got the M3 itch, and bought a 135is for 50 of the cost. Its a very different experience with the manual. It's not better or worse, just different. I prefer it because its more challenging to drive. It's the difference between an automatic and manual transmission. Both have their place, but I've found I like driving a manual better. I can't speak for others, but for me, I just like the simplicity and control of a manual transmission. I'm not a powerperformance guy (I also have a 911SC in the garage), so the M2 is really perfect for me. Drive one and see if you like it! Last edited by M2C; 03-28-2017 at 05:33 PM. Yes, but the only manuals you see are the occasional old BMW. Otherwise, it's only automatics. We don't get the choice here in the UK, M2s are only available with DCT. I'd go for an auto if I was buying now, but I'm glad I have the manual. If you like being more involved in the driving, you'll like the manual. I like the fact that I can't just sit in my car and"
LLAMA,cmv-51,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in everyone's esteem. I'm sure I'm just missing something in these films, so I'm hoping to be enlightened. Anyway, I've just watched Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle and both left me wondering why people like these films so much. Both films are visually rich, but as stories they are both completely incomprehensible. I'm fine with films that are confusing, but these films don't seem to have any form of logic to them. I've read that Spirited Away is all about the ""journey of discovery,"" but in order to appreciate that journey, wouldn't I have to have some idea of what's going on? The other problem I had was that I found the female protagonists in both films extremely irritating. The girl in Spirited Away is constantly whining and screaming. The girl in Howl's Moving Castle is a mess of contradictions - she's bossy, weak, cowardly, yet brave. I'd be really interested to hear why people like these films and if anyone can offer an explanation of what's going on in them. I have to say that I find both Howl and Spirited Away to be rather childish. I'm not a fan of Howl's Moving Castle, but I do like Spirited Away. The story doesn't make a lot of sense, but the visuals are good enough that it doesn't bother me. I agree with you that the main character can get annoying, but I'm able to overlook it. I was able to enjoy Spirited Away, but like you said, the story is confusing. I haven't seen Howl's Moving Castle. Well, I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of anime in general, but I like Spirited Away and really loved Howl's Moving Castle. I don't think the stories are incomprehensible, but they're not exactly crystal clear. I just look at them as fantasy stories, where anything is possible, so I don't think it's necessary to find a logic to it. I did find the girl in Spirited Away a little annoying, but not nearly as annoying as the girl in Howl's Moving Castle. The latter really got on my nerves. I can't say I like anime, but I do like Miyazaki, and I do like Spirited Away. I haven't seen Howl's Moving Castle yet, but I really should. But anyway, in regards to Spirited Away, I don't think it's necessary to understand everything. There are things that will remain unclear and that's fine by me. Well, it seems that everyone agrees that Howl's Moving Castle is not very good. I've read many reviews that state that it's not one of Miyazaki's better efforts. So I guess I'm not missing much there. I'm still at a loss with Spirited Away though. I get that it's a fantasy and that logic doesn't apply, but the problem is that I don't really understand what the point of the story is. I've read that it's about the girl's ""journey of discovery"" and that it's about her growing up. I guess I just don't understand how a story can be about a ""journey"" when the story is completely incomprehensible. I get that Miyazaki is a masterful visual director, but if the stories are confusing and I don't like the characters, then I'm not seeing the point. I'll have to watch Spirited Away again. It's been awhile. I don't think Spirited Away is all that confusing. It's more that Miyazaki is not interested in explaining all of the details. He assumes that if you're smart enough to appreciate his films, you should be able to figure it out on your own. I'm not saying it's easy, just that it's not impossible. Personally I think that Howl's Moving Castle is a terrible film. I absolutely hate it. I also love Spirited Away and think it's a work of art. The story is about a young girl who enters a world of"

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary. I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

BigScience,cmv-51,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the pantheon of great film. Thanks. A: The answer is simple. Your answers are all correct: There isn't a single discernible storyline. What you see are three very different stories being told simultaneously and at times almost alternately over an extended period (spanning years) of time. In one scene, we find ourselves caught up with Aoyama - he's working on his own project but it never really comes together; he has no real purpose other than finding work which may not even pay him well. He fantasises about having children himself yet still decides against marriage because apparently that's ""just common sense."" He seems happy enough until something causes him to question everything he knows about himself. Then there was Chihiro...who's life changes entirely when she meets her family members after undergoing some sort of magic transformation. Aside from these two examples, there's little else going on: In your first paragraph you say that it's like watching 3 movies telling 3 separate stories. That's only partially true: The main movie also contains many scenes from the preceding years, though they don't resolve anything specific. But then again, they're probably just figments of Aoyama's imagination, aren't they?"
OpenAI,cmv-51,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in popularity and critical acclaim. Spirited Away is considered a masterpiece of animation, and there are several reasons for its popularity and critical acclaim: 1. Emotional depth: Spirited Away is a coming of age story that deals with complex emotions such as loss, loneliness, and the struggle to find one's place in the world. The film's main character, Chihiro, goes through a transformative journey that resonates with viewers of all ages. 2. Beautiful animation: Spirited Away is an animated film that showcases some of the most breathtaking animation ever put on screen. From the intricate details of the spirit world to the diverse cast of supernatural creatures, the movie is a visual feast. 3. Cultural significance: Spirited Away is a Japanese film that incorporates traditional Japanese mythology and folklore. The film's exploration of Shintoism and its portrayal of Japanese culture has helped it become a cultural touchstone. 4. Unique storytelling: Spirited Away takes risks with its storytelling by embracing unconventional narrative structures and relying on visual storytelling over exposition. This approach creates a dreamlike quality that draws the viewer into the film's world. Overall, Spirited Away is a film that appeals to a wide range of viewers due to its emotional depth, stunning animation, cultural significance, and unique storytelling."

I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from the recreational teams as a kid), and I have very strong opinions about the value of youth sports. I believe that youth sports are an essential part of a child's development. They teach kids valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. They also provide kids with a healthy outlet for their energy and emotions. Here are some of the specific benefits of youth sports:  Teamwork: Youth sports teach kids how to work together as a team and cooperate with others. This is a valuable skill that they can use in all aspects of their lives, both inside and outside of sports.  Discipline: Youth sports teach kids discipline. They learn how to follow rules, work hard, and stay focused. This discipline can help them succeed in school, in their careers, and in life in general.  Perseverance: Youth sports teach kids perseverance. They learn how to deal with setbacks and keep going, even when things are tough. This perseverance can help them overcome challenges in all areas of their lives.  Healthy outlet: Youth sports provide kids with a healthy outlet for their energy and emotions. This can help them stay physically and emotionally healthy. I believe that all children should have the opportunity to participate in youth sports. It is an important part of their development, and it can provide them with lifelong benefits. I understand that some parents may be hesitant to let their children participate in youth sports because of the risks of injury. However, the benefits of youth sports far outweigh the risks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of injury in youth sports is relatively low. In fact, the CDC estimates that only about 5% of children who participate in youth sports will suffer a serious injury. The benefits of youth sports far outweigh the risks. Youth sports teach kids valuable life skills, provide them with a healthy outlet for their energy and emotions, and help them stay physically and emotionally healthy. All children should have the opportunity to participate in youth sports. I would like to hear your thoughts on this topic. Do you agree with me that youth sports are an essential part of a child's development? Or do you have a different opinion?"
Human,cmv-52,"Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team. I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win."" I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and heshe played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a rewardtrophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding failurelosing, CMV...... Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that hisher team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to himher to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub."
BigScience,cmv-52,"Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from youth level to varsity and college) for 10 years in high school and had to stop after graduation because of constant injuries. I have been back on it some since then. The last couple months were good enough that I started thinking about getting back into fulltime workouts again. From what I've read around here I'm going at a pace where I'll be able to run 4 miles most days with no soreness or tiredness. This is interesting because while this has never worked well before there was one time when we ran 5 12 miles per day without any issues. That just seems like too much effort though. I'm wondering if you knowhave received reportsreviews regarding whether or how long it takes people to recover from such intense training regimens. EDIT: Just remembered reading an article mentioning medication use. Is that something you're considering?"
Tsinghua,cmv-52,"Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from 5th grade) and I have never been a fan of watching my son play the game. The reason is I always saw it as a physical exercise. It was not fun to watch. I started teaching soccer this year. It was fun to watch the kids learn and play. I also realized that it was fun to teach. But the reality is that I can't keep up with my son's training. And as a result, I can't keep up with his soccer game. I have to be his coach and not his player. As a result, I am not as much of a fan of the game anymore. I find it boring to watch. I just want to play. I also think that the game is not worth the effort for kids who are not elite. I just want to play. I have to take him out of soccer practice because I have to work. I'm not asking you to coach my son. I'm just wondering if you can tell me what to do? Should I keep him playing? Or is soccer just not for me? I would love your thoughts. As a parent I am completely with you. I have to be the coach, the captain and the coach. The other parents complain and I have to convince them that the coach is doing the best thing for the kids and the team. And they can not do anything about it. I think that this is how most soccer parents are. We can not keep up with the kids and that is why we have to take the coach role. I think that most kids will benefit from this. They need to feel that they are important and they need to feel that the coach is doing what is best for them. As for the playing the game, I think that you need to take your son out of the game. You have to take him out of the game. You can not keep up with him. He will need to be a player and not a coach. I don't know if that is a good idea or not. It will depend on how he plays. But if he is not a very good player then he will need to learn to play as a player. If he is good then he will need to be a player. You can not coach and play at the same time. You can not be a player and a coach. You can not be a player and a captain. You can not be a player and a player. You can not be a player and a captain and a coach. You can only be a player and you can only be a captain. As a parent I think that it is better to leave the playing to the kids. You can not keep up with the kids and that is why you need to leave the playing to them. As a parent I think that you have to find a way to keep up with the kids and that is why you need to take the coaching role.

OpenAI,cmv-52,"Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from the recreational level) and it was a big part of my childhood. However, looking back I wonder if it was detrimental to my overall development. I feel like I missed out on other experiences, such as music lessons, art classes, and just playing outside with friends. I understand the benefits of sports such as teamwork, discipline, and physical health, but do you think that parents put too much emphasis on their child's sports performance and sacrifice their child's overall well-being? Should parents encourage their children to participate in a variety of activities rather than just focusing on one sport?"
LLAMA,cmv-52,"Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from ages 5-13). I ended up quitting soccer around 13 because I was in a very toxic environment. I don't know if this is the same case in other areas but there was a lot of pressure for us to win at all costs. I've seen people yell at players and bench players that were probably better than other players just because they didn't perform well in a single game. It was very stressful for me as a kid and I was not a huge fan of it. I feel this is more true now in the college ranks. Even in the club ranks. When a coach can play their favorites and not develop the whole team. Also if players are constantly changing teams then it makes it really difficult to find good chemistry. I don't know the age ranges for competitive soccer but I can see why it's a good idea to have multiple teams. I'm just curious to see how you guys feel about competitive soccer and if it's worth the time."

During 2011-2013 though out worked by parents went overseas 4 times which really helped or recovery process so great!

Human,cmv-53,"Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people concluded that this means that in the future, technology will keep creating more jobs than it destroys. I disagree. At the moment, a five year old kid can beat a computer in a lot of things. For example, having a conversation is very hard for AI. So there are still lots of simple jobs that cannot be done by technology. As long as our civilization does not collapse, technology and AI will keep getting better. In the near future, self-driving cars will replace a lot of jobs. This kind of stuff will keep happening until mechanical brains outperform human brains, at a similar or lower cost. When that happens, human labor will become as redundant as horse labor. Change my view! [Obligatory ""Humans Need Not Apply link"
BigScience,cmv-53,"Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people were unhappy about that posting. Personally I think these numbers are bullshit. Still everyone should be happy to have free stuff and not work for anything anymore. But if you really want to know what we're up against with technology it's at least 2 things; People will still need some kind of basic job even when they won't have any money because society already bought their cheap goods (technology)"

PaLM,cmv-53,"Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data]. In the comments, a lot of people were arguing that the article was wrong, and that technology has actually destroyed more jobs than it has created. One person said: ""The article is wrong. Technology has destroyed more jobs than it has created. The only reason we haven't seen a complete collapse of the economy is because we've outsourced most of the jobs that technology has destroyed to third-world countries."" Another person said: ""I agree. The article is wrong. Technology has destroyed more jobs than it has created. The only reason we haven't seen a complete collapse of the economy is because the government has stepped in and created a bunch of new jobs to replace the ones that technology has destroyed."" I think both of these people are wrong. The article is correct. Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed. The only reason we haven't seen a complete collapse of the economy is because technology has also created new industries and new jobs that we couldn't have even imagined 140 years ago. Here are some examples of new industries and new jobs that were created by technology:  The computer industry  The internet industry  The software industry  The mobile phone industry  The social media industry  The e-commerce industry  The cloud computing industry  The artificial intelligence industry  The robotics industry These are just a few examples of the many new industries and new jobs that were created by technology. The fact that these industries and jobs exist is proof that technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed."
Tsinghua,cmv-53,"Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people are trying to find the flaw in the study, and most of the arguments seem to be about the methodology. I was interested in what the data said about the actual job losses from the Industrial Revolution. The author of the study looked at all of the U.S. states from 1860 to 2010. He found that the overall trend in employment was not going down in any particular state. However, there were a few states where the trend was actually going up. These are states where the percentage of people employed is still growing, even though there are fewer jobs overall. There were a couple of interesting surprises: The trend was going up in states where the population is declining, including North Dakota and Wyoming. The trend was going up in states where the population is increasing, including Illinois and Texas. So there's something going on. The state with the most jobs, but where the trend is actually going down, is Connecticut. But if you look at the change in employment from 1860 to 2010, Connecticut actually has the biggest drop. In other words, even though Connecticut is a state with lots of jobs, the overall trend is going down. This is a state where technology is actually taking away more jobs than it's creating. There are a couple of other states where the trend is going down, but the change in employment from 1860 to 2010 is positive. For example, the trend is going up in North Dakota and Wyoming. So while technology is creating more jobs overall, technology is also creating more jobs in some states, and taking away jobs in other states. A couple of points about this: This study is a good example of what you might call ""cause and effect,"" not ""correlation and causation."" There are a lot of jobs that require an education, and a lot of people don't go to college, so in general education is a good predictor of whether a state will have more or less jobs. This is a really good example of ""cause and effect,"" not ""correlation and causation."" There are a lot of jobs that require an education, and a lot of people don't go to college, so in general education is a good predictor of whether a state will have more or less jobs. When I looked at the trend, I was surprised to see that Connecticut has the biggest drop in jobs. It's not a state where technology is creating more jobs overall. Connecticut is a state where technology is creating more jobs overall. But it's a state where technology is creating more jobs in some places, and taking away jobs in other places. What this study shows is that some people have a very strong intuition about what technology is doing to jobs. I've seen this in discussions on rfuturology. People say things like, ""Look at California! California has all the technology companies, so it must be creating lots of jobs."" Or ""Look at New York! New York has all the big banks, so it must be creating lots of jobs."" In fact, California has a lot of jobs overall, but the trend is going down. New York has a lot of jobs overall, but the trend is going up. But if you look at the change in employment from 1860 to 2010, California actually has the biggest drop. New York has the biggest increase. I'm not saying that there's a causal relationship between technology and employment. I'm just saying that people have a very strong intuition about what technology is doing to jobs, and there are a couple of surprises here. It's a pretty complicated picture.

LLAMA,cmv-53,"Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people asked ""so why doesn't this statistic make headlines,"" and the answer is simple: it doesn't fit the dominant narrative. And that's a shame, because the dominant narrative is wrong. You can read the article for the full story, but I'll give you the highlights. The first chart looks at the number of people employed in the U.S. in agriculture. In 1870, almost half of the U.S. labor force worked in agriculture. In 1940, it was down to about 10. Today, it's about 2. And the reason it dropped isn't because farming technology took jobs away. It's because agriculture became more efficient. I grew up in Iowa, where the landscape is dominated by corn fields. When I was a kid, I remember reading a brochure that said that in 1900, it took one person to farm one hundred acres of land. Today, it takes one person to farm one thousand acres. And because of those increased efficiencies, the total amount of food produced has gone up as well. In other words, the total number of people employed in agriculture has gone down, but the output of agriculture has gone up. And it's not just in agriculture where this has happened. Manufacturing is the same way. In 1940, about 30 of the U.S. labor force worked in manufacturing. Today, it's about 10. That's an enormous drop, and again, the narrative is that technology took those jobs away. But, as the chart shows, the total output from manufacturing has gone up. The dominant narrative says that technology took those jobs away. But if you look at the numbers, the dominant narrative is wrong. The real story is that manufacturing has become more efficient. Manufacturing technology has given us the ability to make more stuff with fewer people. And that's a good thing. The dominant narrative says that technology is taking jobs away. And that narrative is being used to justify things like the Basic Guaranteed Income. But if you look at the numbers, the dominant narrative is wrong. Technology isn't taking jobs away. Technology is making us more efficient. And that's the real story. 10:11:00 AM, Wednesday 01 November 2017 from rferguson.org Copyright 2003-2017 rferguson.org."

It's not that they killed ""journalism"" as much is just replaced with something else...like re-blogging or status updates from your friends on Facebook (which I think we could call curation). Maybe even blogging itself will get displaced by some new technology? We don't know what's next but right now less traditional outlets have to compete for attention when you can go up against many others doing essentially same thing at once instead only having one staff writer who must produce content every dayweek vs 100 writers competing simultaneously over twitter feeds..and then all those tweets getting collated into nytimes etc...If someone said ""we've got 2 hours per week"" everyone would understand because time constraints aren'r an excuse anymore!

BigScience,cmv-54,"One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders ""free college tuition"" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? Let's say I have 500,000 and I want to buy something with that money (let's take an expensive car). If 40 of people in my community can go to college for free then less educated individuals will be able to afford it as well. Say someone who can't attend school takes out 100k from their 401 (k) without having ever saved anything before? Wouldn't they lose all those contributions? A: The return on investment through higher education increases at said institutions which provide access to advanced degrees. The ability to get such study exposes students to new ideas, connections, and information not otherwise available within any given institution. This happens because part-time studies are more feasible due to lower costs than full-time work schedules, but also encourages greater demand by employers for knowledgeable workers. If you had no opportunity to obtain advanced degrees your life would be simpler. No one wants to spend years working while only graduating with high schools diplomas or call sheets. It's like going on vacation 5 times per year when you can't travel much yourself. You don't expect your children to do better physically when they're 8 months old than 18-months-old. High-education benefits increase both concentration and proficiency in fields studied: There is a positive correlation between student's educational level and a wide range of healthcare outcomes including mortality rates.

OpenAI,cmv-54,"One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders ""free college tuition"" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this a valid argument? The argument that the value of a degree would go down if everyone had one is not entirely accurate. While it's true that increasing access to higher education could lead to an increase in the number of people with degrees, it is unlikely to lead to a decrease in the value of a degree. Several factors contribute to the value of a degree, such as the quality of education, individual skills and abilities, and the reputation of the institution that grants the degree. Moreover, there will always be a demand for highly skilled workers, even if more people have degrees. As the economy evolves, the job market also changes, and workers will need to continually upgrade their skills to remain competitive in the workforce. Additionally, access to higher education promotes social mobility and benefits society as a whole. In summary, while there may be some debate about the specifics of how increased access to higher education could affect the value of a degree, the argument that everyone having a degree would necessarily lead to a decrease in its value is not entirely accurate."
LLAMA,cmv-54,"One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders ""free college tuition"" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this a legitimate concern? I would assume that by and large, people with college degrees are more productive than people who don't, so even if they are paid less than they are currently, they still would be worth more to the economy than without a college degree. I've been told that if everyone has a college degree, the wages for people with a degree would go down. This seems like a legitimate concern, but I'm not quite convinced. Is this a valid concern or am I missing something? If I'm not wrong, this is a classic example of ""skill-biased technological change."" The idea is that in the past, most production jobs required ""muscle,"" so that skill requirements were not that important. This is no longer the case, as most production jobs require at least a high school degree. The best example to me is that the industrial revolution made it possible to replace farm workers with machines, which also led to a rapid urbanization process. People moved to cities, were offered different kinds of jobs, and the economy as a whole benefited from this shift. Is a degree a good idea in itself? Do you think college degrees are a good idea in general? What is the purpose of a degree? Do you think that they make you more likely to be successful? I guess I agree with the sentiment that going to college is a good idea, but I don't agree with the sentiment that everyone should go to college. Not everyone wants to go to college. I think that we should do whatever we can to allow people to choose what they want to do with their lives. Some people would rather spend their time working and getting paid money than going to college. We shouldn't force people to go to college if they don't want to. I think that the people who don't go to college should be able to get good jobs and earn money. I don't like the idea of a society where the only way to get paid a decent wage is to go to college. I know this sounds a little bit like a ""get off my lawn"" type thing, but I do think that college degrees have become somewhat devalued. When I went to college, I worked hard. I did all the reading, went to all the classes, and put in lots of time writing my papers. I graduated in 2012. I was the last year before the Millennials, and we had to work for our college degrees. We did real research, and we had to write real papers. Now, the students are getting degrees without working nearly as hard. I don't think that students are learning nearly as much in college. I think that this is because college is so much easier than it was in the past. I think that the wages for college degrees should reflect the effort put into earning them. As it stands, a college degree isn't worth much, and I don't think that should be the case. I do think that college degrees are somewhat devalued, but I don't think that this is a result of the number of people who have degrees. I think that it's a result of the standards of colleges. I think that college degrees would become more valuable if we had better college standards. We should make students work harder, and we should make sure that they are learning. I think that college degrees should mean something. I think that college degrees should mean that the person who has them has a certain amount of knowledge and a certain set of skills. As it stands, college degrees don't necessarily mean this. I think that we should be able to do something about this. I think that we should increase the standards for college. I think that if we do this, we should be able to make college degrees more valuable. This is a major concern. People who are unskilled and uneducated are much more likely to be unemployed than people who have a college degree. In many cases, these people end up on welfare because they can't find a job. Increasing the amount of college graduates would increase the number of people who can't find a job, and it would decrease the amount of people on welfare. I know that it seems counter-intuitive, but I do think that making college free would lead to less people on welfare. This is a very interesting question, and I think that the answer has to do with the economics of supply and demand. I think that the more people who have college degrees, the less valuable a college degree will be. I think that it's important"

Is this true? lm28469 This argument is flawed in that if you are a better student, you will get a better job, and thus, will earn more money. The degree itself doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that matters. Also, there are degrees that are less ""used"" and more ""expensive."" A degree in cosmetology or a degree in medical devices (at least in the US) are probably two of the most useless degrees that you can get, but they are more expensive than most other degrees, so in a way, they pay for themselves. aviv As a point of reference, the average college student graduates with a 30k debt. This doesn't include the cost of books, the cost of living, the cost of student housing, etc. So while the cost of a degree is higher than most other degrees, the cost of college is higher than most other things. x38iq84n So while the cost of a degree is higher than most other degrees, the cost of college is higher than most other things. As a student, I think this is a very fair assessment. leroymasochist There's a bit of irony here, as the primary argument against free college tuition is that it will lead to a lower standard of living for people with college degrees. angersock Except that, in a free market, everyone is supposed to have a college degree, at the expense of people who don't. That's the whole point of a free market. leroymasochist Free market ! ""let the market decide."" If we were to do that, then what would be the purpose of education? Education would become a commodity and just like a commodity, it would be sold at a price which people are willing to pay for it. If there were no government programs, then the people who would pay the most for education would be the people who were the most skilled and had the most demand for their skills. The problem with this is that the people who are the most skilled and have the most demand for their skills are also the people who have the most to lose if the market becomes a free market. angersock The point of education is that you can do the same thing in the free market. You're not required to get a degree to get a job. leroymasochist This is correct, but only if you have a degree. If you have no degree, then you will get a lower wage than someone with a degree, and that lower wage is not free. If we were to let the market decide, then all people would have a degree. I have a degree. I get a wage. It's not free. angersock The point of education is that you can do the same thing in the free market. You 're not required to get a degree to get a job. I would contend that you are. If you're going to work in the field that you do, then you should be familiar with the field. You shouldn't need to take an intro to the field in order to work in it. And in the event that you do, you're going to need to get some sort of certification to do that job. And that certification will be much cheaper and easier to get if you have a college degree. leroymasochist Yes, that's correct. You can get a degree without doing anything to improve your chances of getting a job. That's the point of a degree, to get a job. It's not free. katzgrau As a student who is contemplating college, I'm wondering if I'm missing something here. Why are there people who are paid to do this? Why aren't we all doing this? I think it's an interesting idea, but why aren't we all doing this? If everyone is doing this, why is it still free? If it were free, wouldn't everyone be doing this? jt2190 You're missing a lot of factors here. If you were to be doing this, you'd have to pay for it yourself, and have to find a job afterwards. If you don't have a job, or if your wages are lower than the cost of the tuition, then you're just paying more to do something you could do anyway. And if you are doing this, then the economy will be a lot smaller, which is a negative for everyone else. klodolph It's not as bad as it sounds."
Human,cmv-54,"One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders ""free college tuition"" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? In countries like Germany and Denmark, only the best of students make it into higher education, whereas in American, our standards to get into a university or a community college are laughable. Would we need to raise the bar on admission requirements if college was free? The main argument here is that making college education free in our system would end up hurting the overachieving students."

Human,cmv-55,"Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself more and more money without bearing any of the expense. I lost my job last month and I'm on unemployment. Why should I get a say in how much money I get when I am living off the work of others? This is just like when you are a child. You don't get to make the rules because you aren't paying the rent, and you don't get to set your allowance. Money is a medium of exchange it is received when you provide a good or service of value to someone, and spent when you take a good or service of value from someone else. Therefore the more wealth you accumulate, the more net value you have provided to society. These people should have more of a say in how our society is run because they have given it the most. Also this would be for the best since rich people are generally smarter and more competent than poor people, and would choose better politicians that don't just appeal to emotion."
BigScience,cmv-55,"Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself into office and give everything away. To take the opposition view, we must assume there exists some form of social contract between men (or at least our government) where due to our actions during our lifetime, they promise to provide us with certain benefits like health care or housing if only we accept their rules, whether it be voting laws or environmental regulations. So we have been promised these things by those who are elected based on what people think about them as individuals. If you want more power than this then why not try direct democracy? Of course such an existing system would probably need tweaking, but we can never know exactly how best to organise society until we understand how humans behave. The reason that most countries do not elect all members of parliament directly from the citizenry (which means that many MPs actually represent different interests), among other reasons because: If there's no separation of powers between legislature and executive then it's fairly easy to move legislation which does not reflect majority opinion - simply put through every single step before even gaining any support from cabinet ministers. It's very difficult to pick up votes within your own party unless you're also able to offer tangible promises of future funding so you still face incentive problems much like politicians do outside politics. A: This has to do a bit with the idea of representative democracies vs direct democracies. Elections occur when one person expresses ""their will."" In turn, representatives act upon the expressed wishes. The policies implemented are generally agreed upon either explicitly, e.g., a constitution, or implicitly via consenting behavior. This represents a quid pro quo with voters. In contrast, direct democracy involves people freely choosing the options available to them andor delegating authority to others to make decisions that affect them personally i.e., someone else's ""decision."" As Brian points out below, elections typically require each individual to express their personal preference regarding candidate A over B, thinking about both the gains afforded by winning candidate A choices and losses imposed by losing candidates' policy outcomes. One might argue here that elections favor insurance against short-term changes while direct democracy favors flexibility and long-term change. However, human nature tends toward stability rather than change; therefore, I believe a compromise somewhere in-between election-based systems and entirely bottom-updirect mechanisms exist. A: I am going to answer my question after reading several answers above since I really feel biased towards overwhelmingly supporting parliamentary democracy. One important benefit of parties is that they allow governments to gain popularity and stay in power longer, thereby allowing them the time to implement programs- especially ones in areas such as education and healthcare. It helps prevent corruption tooespecially if politicians can sell sensible policies. In addition to providing good ideas, big companies help fund campaigns by donating money to political action committees. Another way large corporations contribute is by hiring lobbyists whose job is to fight to protect corporate interests and bring together business groups to support particular plans. Thus, it becomes easier for politicians to keep in touch with industry lobbies and find ways to work around legislative initiatives designed to limit profits, increase standards, etc. While I love lots of the things mentioned above, I disagree strongly with the following statement made by David Brooks in his book entitled Righteous Victim: Rather than seeking special treatment or being viewed as exceptionally small fish, Washington's elite see themselves as part of an international network of institutions. They depend upon elites worldwide to appropriate resources for their global empire. And for the past two decades they've found American taxpayers very willing to foot the bill - by financing wars abroad and building Palms and Burjassot hotels, Wall Street firms' 'green' projects, and the private equity firm Carlyle Capital Management's backing of various US-backed dictatorships. At the same time, the United States stands accused of failing dismally to fulfill its obligation to maintain humanitarian principles internationally-of defending weak states victimized by terrorism and collapsed economies, More specifically speaking, I disagree with his suggestion that large-scale charitable donations to American institutions like universities, hospitals, museums, libraries etc. are used to build palaces in foreign lands. To me, that seems counter-productive as far as getting foreigners interested in visiting America. Also, I do agree with David Brooks when he says Americans ""cheat their way to wealth"" and use tax breaks to avoid paying provincial income tax, real estate taxes, capital gains taxation, excise taxes, inheritance taxes etc.. But I disagree with him when he suggests that Americans enjoy free-riding because they fill roads with cars instead of using public transportation; buy clothes made overseas to cut costs before clothing manufacturers stop; send home millions of dollars per year (over 200 billion according to Brooks' figures) in remittances despite living in a country like Indonesia which charges high rates of exchange fees, saving less on currency conversion compared to sending it back home; eat food imported from India and China as opposed to growing local markets domestically; waste water polluting rivers and groundwater, fu"
PaLM,cmv-55,"Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest because it allows people to have a say in how something that they don't contribute to is run. This can lead to decisions being made that are not in the best interests of the community as a whole. For example, a person who does not pay taxes may be more likely to vote for policies that benefit themselves at the expense of others. This could include policies that reduce taxes for the wealthy or increase spending on programs that they use, such as education or healthcare. In addition, voting without paying taxes can lead to a decrease in the quality of public goods and services. This is because taxes are used to fund these goods and services, and if fewer people are paying taxes, there will be less money available to provide them. This could lead to cuts in education, healthcare, and other essential services that benefit everyone in the community. Finally, voting without paying taxes can undermine the legitimacy of the government. When people do not have a stake in the system, they are less likely to feel invested in it and more likely to question its authority. This can lead to social unrest and instability. For all of these reasons, it is important to require people to pay taxes in order to vote. This helps to ensure that everyone has a stake in the system and that decisions are made in the best interests of the community as a whole."

I could just vote myself As an AI language model, I don't have personal thoughts or beliefs. However, It's worth noting that many democracies allow citizens to vote regardless of whether or not they pay taxes. This is because the government is responsible for providing services and upholding laws that affect all citizens, not just those who pay taxes. Additionally, the ability to vote is seen as a fundamental right in many countries, and denying someone the right to vote based on their tax status could be seen as discriminatory. Ultimately, it is up to each society to determine the requirements for voting, but the prevailing view in most democracies is that all citizens should have an equal say in how their government is run."

Also, if you pay taxes, you are paying for services rendered, not voting rights.

The government is not a club that you can choose to join or not. If you are going to live in this country, you must pay taxes. It's a cost of living. If you get to vote on how the money is spent, you're getting a say on how other people's money is spent, and that's not fair. The people who pay taxes should have a say on how it's used.

PaLM,cmv-56,"I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are quite negative. This can lead to people forming opinions of candidates and parties that are not based on their actual policies or platforms. For example, a candidate may be attacked for being ""soft on crime"" or ""tax-and-spend"" even if their actual policies do not support these stereotypes. This can make it difficult for voters to make informed decisions about who to vote for. In addition, negative campaigning can create a negative atmosphere in the political discourse. It can discourage people from participating in the political process and make it harder for candidates to build consensus. This can have a negative impact on the democratic process. There are a number of things that can be done to reduce the amount of negative campaigning in Canada. One is to increase the amount of public funding for political campaigns. This would reduce the need for candidates to raise money from private donors, who may have a vested interest in seeing certain candidates elected. Another is to require candidates to participate in a series of debates before the election. This would give voters a chance to hear directly from the candidates and make their own decisions about who to vote for. Finally, it is important to educate voters about the importance of voting and the role that they play in the democratic process. This can help to reduce the amount of voter apathy and encourage people to participate in the political process. By taking these steps, Canada can reduce the amount of negative campaigning and create a more positive and democratic political environment."

LLAMA,cmv-57,"Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of trying to get them to reconsider I realized I've been wasting my time. My question is: If I were to have a child with my husband who is pro-vax, what legal measures could I take to ensure that my child will be vaccinated despite my parents' dislike of it? I am planning to have my child vaccinated regardless of my parents' opinions, but I'm worried about the possibility of them trying to take my child away from me or trying to convince my child that vaccines are dangerous. Laws vary from state to state, but generally, it is not possible to override your parent's rights to make decisions for you while you are a minor. Some decisions they cannot make include (in the United States) abortion, or marriage. This is generally considered to be a medical decision that parents can make. However, once you are an adult you have the right to make medical decisions for yourself. If you wish to receive vaccinations you can do so. It is impossible to predict the future, but in your situation it sounds like you will be making this decision as an adult. It is common for parents to make decisions that they believe are best for their child, and for their child to later decide to go a different way. This can be very upsetting for the parents, but if it is legal it is their decision. In my opinion, your parents will likely never change their minds. They have to decide for themselves. Just like you have to decide for yourself. Once you are an adult you can get vaccinated. There is a legal way to prevent your parents from taking you away. It's called emancipation. Basically it's when a minor becomes legally independent of their parents. There are many ways to become emancipated in the US. Once you are emancipated your parents cannot take you away and your parents cannot prevent you from getting vaccinated. I was recently (a few months ago) in a very similar situation to your's. My parents (especially my mother) are very anti-vax. I was never vaccinated and they wereare vehemently against vaccinating me. I started looking into emancipation about a year ago. I wanted to get vaccinated and go to college. I didn't want to live with my parents anymore because they made my life miserable. I live in the US, specifically, California. I was able to emancipate myself by following some very specific steps that I was given by a social worker at the local YMCA. I first went to the YMCA to ask for help. I spoke to a social worker who gave me information about emancipating. She gave me a packet of papers with information about emancipation. I then went to the local courthouse and filed for emancipation. I had to fill out a few forms, get a background check, and show that I could support myself. I also had to show that I had a place to live and that I could pay for it. I was then assigned a social worker. I had to meet with her a few times. She basically was ensuring that I was making a well informed decision to emancipate. She also ensured that I could support myself. I then had to go to court. I had to make a presentation in front of a judge about why I wanted to be emancipated. I gave the judge a list of my current living expenses. I also gave him the information about my job. I was then asked a few questions. My parents were notified about my emancipation and they were allowed to come to the court hearing to speak to the judge. They did not come. The judge then granted me emancipation. You may be able to follow a similar process. If you're interested, you could call the YMCA in your town and ask for help. They may be able to provide you with information and help you to start the process. I am 16, and I live in North Carolina. I was never vaccinated as a child, and I am planning on getting vaccinated as soon as I turn 18. I have plans to go to college and get a job. I am also planning to get emancipated as soon as I turn 16. I will be following a similar process to what I described above. I will be getting a job as soon as I can. I will also be planning to get a place"

OpenAI,cmv-57,"Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of research and discussions with healthcare professionals, it's become clear to me that vaccines are essential for public health. What can I do to encourage my parents to reconsider their stance on vaccinations? It's great that you've done your own research and understand the importance of vaccines. Here are a few suggestions on how you might approach your parents on this sensitive issue: 1. Start with empathy: Before jumping into the facts and statistics, try to understand where your parents are coming from, and how they came to their beliefs. Ask them about their concerns, and listen actively to their responses. 2. Share your own experience: Explain to your parents how your own understanding and views on vaccinations have evolved over time. Share any research or conversations that have led you to see the importance of vaccines. 3. Bust common myths: Many anti-vax arguments are based on misinformation and misconceptions. Be prepared to thoroughly debunk any common myths your parents may bring up. 4. Offer reliable resources: Provide them with reliable and trusted resources on vaccines. Doctors, scientific organizations, and government agencies all have information available that emphasizes the safety and necessity of vaccinations. 5. Show care and concern: Ultimately, your parents' health is a priority. Explain to them that you care about their well-being, and that you believe that vaccinations are the best way to protect them from serious and deadly diseases. 6. Be patient: It may take time for your parents to change their minds. Stay calm, respectful, and patient with them as you work through this issue together."
Tsinghua,cmv-57,"Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of working with parents of vaccine injured children and observing many family dynamics it is clear that this is a common theme. The parents of the vaccine injured children I work with have their own reasons for not vaccinating. They have witnessed the adverse effects of vaccines firsthand and often come from a long line of family members that have suffered from autoimmune diseases, autoimmune disorders, seizures, autism, UTI's, ear infections, and many other problems. This is a far cry from the mainstream media portrayal of the average American family who only needs to look at the newspaper headlines to know that there is a pandemic of infectious disease plaguing our country. Yet, this is not the case. In fact, most parents of vaccine injured children have not been exposed to the media's propaganda. They have not been exposed to the anti-vax groups. They have not seen the movie Miracles from Heaven. They have not read the books ""Vaxxed"" or ""Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe."" They have not watched the documentaries ""Vaxxed"" and ""Vaccine Crimes."" In fact, they have no idea how prevalent anti-vax is in our country. They have no idea how much damage has been done to our children by those who would do anything to promote their ""beliefs."" I was just beginning to research vaccine injuries when I stumbled upon a statistic that I will never forget. I learned that one in every 33 children in the United States is on the autism spectrum. When I heard this statistic, I thought to myself, ""Oh my gosh, that's an epidemic."" The problem is that this is not an epidemic of vaccine injury. This is an epidemic of vaccine preventable disease. In fact, the CDC states that in the year 2000, 23,000 children were diagnosed with autism. In the year 2010, 42,000 children were diagnosed with autism. As the CDC and media continue to push the narrative that vaccines are safe and effective, and that vaccines are not the cause of autism, I have come to the realization that these parents of vaccine injured children are in a very precarious situation. The majority of these parents are single parents who are fighting a very uphill battle to prove that vaccines caused their child's autism. They have no medical insurance and no resources. Many have no income and are struggling to pay for their children's medical expenses. Their children are being denied special education services and their children are being rejected from public school. I cannot begin to tell you how many parents I have met that have had their children denied vaccines for a legitimate medical condition. Many of these parents are on the autism spectrum themselves. This does not make them any less deserving of the right to get their children vaccinated. I do not believe that the anti-vax movement is motivated by malice. I believe that the anti-vax movement is motivated by a lack of understanding. I believe that many people who are against vaccines have never had their children vaccinated. They do not have a personal stake in this debate. They do not have a family member or a friend that has been injured by a vaccine. This is not to say that there are not people who are anti-vax who are doing so out of malice. There are. However, I believe that the vast majority of people who are against vaccines are doing so because they have not had their children vaccinated. They have not had the opportunity to see the adverse effects of vaccines firsthand. They have not had the opportunity to observe the reactions of their friends and family to vaccine preventable diseases. In fact, I believe that the majority of people who are against vaccines are people who do not even realize that vaccines are safe and effective. They are not informed. They are not educated. They are not thinking about the safety of their children. They are thinking about the safety of their beliefs. As parents, we must stop thinking about our children's beliefs and start thinking about their safety. We must stop thinking about our children's beliefs and start thinking about their health. We must stop thinking about our children's beliefs and start thinking about their lives. There are so many children who are not getting vaccinated because they do not have the resources to do so. I am certain that there are so many parents who are scared of what will happen if their children are vaccinated. I am certain that there are so many parents who are afraid of the unknown. I am certain that there are so many parents who are afraid that their children will not be accepted by the rest of the world. I am certain that there are so many parents who are afraid that their children will be ""different"" because of their vaccinations."
OpenAI,cmv-58,"Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I want to acknowledge that gender is a complex and personal topic, and everyone has the right to identify and express themselves in a way that feels true to who they are. That being said, I understand that some people may find Facebook's list of gender options confusing or overwhelming. It's important to remember that the purpose of these options is to create a more inclusive and diverse online community where people can accurately express their gender identity. While some of these options may seem redundant or unnecessary to certain individuals, they may be important and meaningful to others. It's important to be respectful and understanding of each person's unique experiences and identities. If you have any specific questions or concerns about Facebook's gender options or how to navigate them, I would be happy to help you find the information you need."
Human,cmv-58,"Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am not against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders. Anyway, some of the terms that come to mind are Agender and Androgynous. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? Genderfluid and Bigender seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. Does it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as gender-fluid because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than cross-dressing. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing. Also, what's the deal with ""cis""? Cis-female. Cis-male. Cis-man. Cis-woman. Cisgender. If the definition of ""cis"" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they just be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy). Again, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone actually identifying as something. With that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're ""gender-fluid"" or ""cis-female."" It makes me believe that I may be seeing this the wrong way - or maybe these terms really are inessential and pointless? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

LLAMA,cmv-58,"Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I do not support transgenderism - it is a sin that will ultimately send the person to hell. That being said, I don't discriminate against them either. I'm not going to deny them jobs, hurt them, or do anything else to them. I simply do not agree with it. That being said, I'm trying to go through and figure out what the heck these gender options are on Facebook. Here we go. Agender is a person who does not identify with any gender. They are a person who is gender neutral. To be perfectly honest, I feel like this is just another way to say ""I'm not interested in dating anyone or don't want to identify with a gender."" This one isn't overly confusing, it's just a bit silly in my opinion. Androgynous is a gender that is used to describe a person who does not fit into either a male or female category. This is because of either physical traits or a mixture of the two. They also have a balance of masculine and feminine traits. This is pretty self-explanatory. A bigender is a person who has two genders. This is a person who will either identify as male or female on any given day. There's not much to say about this one. The definition for this one is pretty complex, so I'll just explain it in my own words. A pangender is a person who identifies with all genders. They are a person who has no gender. Neutrois is a person who feels no connection with their assigned sex. They feel neither male or female. They are a person who feels like they have no gender or sex. Two-Spirit is a term that is used by Native American societies to describe a person who has both a male and female spirit in their body. They were usually people who were homosexual, transgender, or intersex. It was an honor to be a two-spirit and they were usually people of high standing in the tribe. So, what does it mean to be genderqueer? It means you are a person who does not identify with any gender. They are a person who is genderless. This seems to be a mixture of agender and neutrois. It doesn't really mean much of anything. Gender Fluid is a person who will experience gender in different ways. They are a person who has a dynamic gender identity or expression. It's not really gender or lack of gender. It's just a dynamic identity. Male to Female is a person who is a transgender male. They are a person who identifies as a male but has female characteristics. They are a person who was born with male genitalia but will either dress as a woman or undergo surgery to become a woman. Female to Male is the exact opposite of MTF. They are a person who is a transgender female. They are a person who identifies as a female but has male characteristics. They are a person who was born with female genitalia but will either dress as a man or undergo surgery to become a man. Gender Variant is a person who is a person whose gender identity or expression differs from their assigned sex. This is a person who has a gender identity that is not traditional. They can identify as male, female, both, or neither. I'm not sure what gender questioning means. I've tried to look it up and couldn't find anything, so I can only assume that it is a person who is questioning their gender. Maybe they aren't sure if they are male, female, or transgender. I'm not sure. There are many other genders on Facebook, including transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender non-binary. However, I think I've written enough about this topic. I'm not exactly sure what any of these genders mean, but I can say that none of them are in the Bible and they are all against God.

Facebook's bizarre addition is to label men with plastic surgery as ""masculinized women."" WTF? MEN WITH ALTERED CIRCLES: Facebook identifies men with altered genitalia as ""trans women.""

PaLM,cmv-58,"Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am a transgender woman, and I believe that gender is a spectrum. There are many ways to identify, and no one should be made to feel like they don't fit in. However, I think that Facebook went too far with their new gender options. Some of them are so specific that they only apply to a small number of people. For example, there is a gender option for ""pangender,"" which means that someone feels like they are all genders at once. There is also a gender option for ""agender,"" which means that someone doesn't feel like they have a gender at all. I think that these new gender options are unnecessary and confusing. They make it harder for people to understand what gender is, and they make it more difficult for people to find the right pronouns to use. I also think that the new gender options are offensive to people who are transgender. They suggest that being transgender is something that is new and trendy, when it is actually a real and valid identity. I believe that Facebook should remove the new gender options. They are not helpful, and they are only causing more confusion and division. Here are some of the reasons why I think the new gender options are harmful:  They make it harder for people to understand what gender is.

They are offensive to people who are transgender. I urge Facebook to remove the new gender options. They are not helpful, and they are only causing more confusion and division. Additional thoughts:  I think that it is important to remember that gender is a spectrum. There is no one right way to be transgender, and there is no one right way to identify.  I also think that it is important to be respectful of people's pronouns. Even if you don't understand someone's gender identity, you should still try to use the pronouns that they prefer.  Finally, I think that it is important to create a world where everyone feels safe and accepted. We should all be working to create a more inclusive society, where everyone can be themselves."
BigScience,cmv-58,"Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am not a fan of gender-neutral pronouns like ""theythemthem"" (which just confused me back in 2009 when they were introduced), nor do I support the idea that people should be able to choose their own preferred pronoun whether it is ""aan"" or ""hisherhim."" But what if we really want everyone's privacy? What happens if someone wants hisher name to remain anonymous because heshe doesn't feel comfortable with being identified as malefemale? So let us imagine for a moment...we have a bunch of varying genders at our fingertips which can be used by anyone who wishes to demonstrate a different side of themselves. Wouldn't you love to carry around multiple identities so that people don't know exactly how your personality works behind closed doors! Especially if they're hard-partying types... I think it's time we take advantage of these new genders we now have available on FB platform and start implementing some fun perks such as: Since we're talking about changed names, let's see where else could we use various genders: let's say you're going to hire an actress from Russia to play one character while she's acting under another identity somewhere else. There would certainly need to be a way for her employer to check her ""EU passports""; sticking with only two genders wouldn't work here since we'd still get both males AND females. The same goes for similar situations; maybe there's a singer who's also an actor playing characters she has never done before but definitely did in real life. Sounds crazy right?! But that's precisely why I'm saying anything can't hurt! If you thought it was bad enough having an entire Twitter account dedicated exclusively to yourself, wait till you read this: Facebook allows users to create up to 30 separate profiles within one single account. This means that you'll actually face double the amount of difficulty trying to find ways to hide something from friends or even from future employers. If there're already plenty of apps online to help you keep track of things that shouldn't be known to the world outside, what more options does Facebook offer than its very own service called 'privacy'?! The goal seems pretty simple though: for each profile created, the default settings will allow certain posts to appear on ALL other accounts automatically. This includes status updates, photosvideos posted to personal wallsalbums, comments left by others etc. (but won't include those sent using messages). However, if you'd prefer that everything stay between yours and your peeps, then go ahead and click 'Hide my activity from all public displays.'"

BigScience,cmv-59,"I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for murder, and they do not like being locked up in jail or go crazy so that this doesn't happen anymore then I think it would be nice to give them an ending with dignity. If people are committing crimes against others as opposed to themselves how can you prevent these from happening? If people can't care about other humans why don't we just stop making them? It shouldn't take away someone's right to die but rather help facilitate it by providing palliative care when one desires it. This does seem quite confusing but hopefully it's clear what I'm trying to say... A: The Health Care Act Implementation Order takes into account health conditions (including suicide) which may cause death. As such, possible terminations of treatment must occur at least 30 days prior to the time the patient dies.

Human,cmv-59,"I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for drug distribution they can choose to die. This would decrease prison population and relief funding to the prison system. Less people less taxpayers have to spend. The prisoner would get to choose if they want to die, but the state would perform the execution. This would only apply to people 18 years or older. Prisoners sometimes have to endure very horrible things while in prison.

PaLM,cmv-59,"I believe that someone who has been convicted of a non-violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So, if someone is doing 20 years for drug possession, they should be able to choose to die instead of serving their sentence. There are a few reasons why I believe this. First, I think it is cruel and unusual punishment to force someone to spend decades of their life in prison, especially if they did not commit a violent crime. Prison is supposed to be about rehabilitation, but for many people, it is simply a place to rot. Spending years in a cell with little to no hope for the future can take a devastating toll on a person's mental and physical health. Second, I believe that giving prisoners the option to end their own lives is an act of compassion. It allows them to escape a situation that they may feel is no longer worth living. It also gives them control over their own death, which is something that is often taken away from prisoners. Of course, there are some people who would argue that allowing prisoners to commit suicide is morally wrong. They would say that it is a form of assisted suicide, which is illegal in most countries. However, I believe that there is a big difference between helping someone to die who is terminally ill and helping someone to die who is simply tired of living in prison. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to allow prisoners to end their own lives is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. However, I believe that the option of death should be available to all prisoners, regardless of the crime they committed."

""We are going to try to keep the drug war as a public health issue, not as a criminal justice issue. And so we are going to make those changes to the guidelines.

LLAMA,cmv-59,"I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for robbing a store, they should be able to ask the judge to order their execution. This would save the taxpayer tons of money. The money that would have gone to provide the prisoner with food, water, clothing, and medical care would be redirected into a more worthy cause. In this case, I agree. What if someone did something so horrible that they could never be forgiven? Should they be able to go out with dignity? Like the pilot who deliberately crashed a plane full of people into the Alps. What if they never did anything wrong and it was a mistaken identity or something like that? I know the death penalty is legal in the US, but not for every crime. So I don't see why it should be mandatory. I agree. I think this should be an option for every inmate. Hmm, I don't know. I agree with a lot of the points that have been brought up about how it would save money and there are a lot of people who truly deserve to die for their crimes, but there's something about the option being taken away from them that seems wrong to me. I don't know. I don't have a solid stance on this. I agree with the thought that prisoners should be allowed to end their lives but I feel that it would have to be a federal decision and not a state one. What I mean is that every state has different laws for the death penalty. Some have it, some don't, some have it for some crimes and not others, and so on. So I don't think that the option to commit suicide should be up to the state in which the prisoner is being held but should be a national law. I feel like this is a really good idea. I think that if a prisoner wants to commit suicide then they should be allowed to. It would save money for the prison system and make the criminal feel better about their punishment. I agree with this, if someone does something that is so terrible then they should be able to end it all for themselves and not the taxpayers. I don't think this is a good idea. I think people should be able to live their life and be punished by the law but not be able to take their own life. I don't think this is a good idea. I don't think prisoners should be able to choose when they die. If they do something that bad to where they would go to prison in the first place, they should have to live with it. I think that this should be a choice. I think that if someone does something bad enough to be put in prison, they should be able to end their life however they see fit. I think that this could save money, but also could save their families a lot of pain as well. I agree with this. If someone is in prison for murder, and they are on the death row, then I believe that they should have the option to take their own life and not wait to be put to death by the state. I think this is a great idea. I think if a person does something so bad that they are being put in prison for a long period of time, they should be able to end their life instead of living it out in prison. It would save a lot of money on taxes. I agree with this. If someone does something so bad they should have the choice to end it all. It would save a lot of money on taxes. I think it would be great if we allowed criminals to choose to commit suicide as a punishment. It would save us money and give the criminal an easy way out. I agree. If someone does something bad enough to get them to prison, then they should have the choice to end their life. It would save a lot of money. This is a good idea. I agree that prisoners should have the choice to end their life. It would save a lot of money on taxes. I agree with this.

However, ethically speaking, individuals who have been convicted of a non-violent crime and are serving a long sentence may experience significant psychological distress, social isolation, and feelings of hopelessness, which could lead them to contemplate ending their lives. It is important to note that suicide prevention programs, counseling services, and mental health treatments are available inside prisons to help detainees in distress. The decision to allow or deny the option of ending one's life in prison is a complex issue that involves many legal, ethical, and moral considerations beyond my capabilities to discuss or resolve on my own."

Tsinghua,cmv-60,"To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For instance, I would normally argue that incest is disgusting and should not be tolerated because it is unnatural and harmful to society. So far, so good. However, in a case like this, the reasoning I would normally use against incestuous marriage does not apply. First of all, incestuous marriage is not harming society. No one is being harmed by it. Secondly, incestuous marriage is not unnatural. It is, in fact, the most natural thing to do. All species have had, and continue to have, incestuous marriage. Even those who claim to be in favor of homosexual marriage, would admit that there are no objections to allowing homosexual marriage because it is natural and would benefit society. The claim of being against homosexual marriage because it is unnatural is simply a rationalization for their opposition. Third, incestuous marriage is not harmful. Homosexual marriage is not harmful. What harm could come from having the same sex married to the same sex? There is nothing harmful about it. The argument for not allowing homosexual marriage is not an argument for not allowing incestuous marriage. The fact that homosexual marriage is still allowed does not make incestuous marriage right. In fact, if it were possible to have the same sex marry each other, there would be no argument against it. If it is not right to have the same sex marry each other, it is not right to have the same sex marry each other. To have the same sex marry each other would violate the moral laws that would prohibit it. I do not believe that incestuous marriage is immoral. However, it does violate the laws of nature and of society. It is also a very disturbing thing. I do not want my children, my wife, my sisters, or anyone else I love to be involved in incestuous marriage. It is a very dangerous thing. 7 comments: You wrote, ""Homosexual marriage is still allowed does not make incestuous marriage right."" This is a bit misleading. In fact, as far as I know, homosexual marriage is still allowed in California, and, as far as I know, homosexual marriage is still not allowed in Florida. This is due to the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). So, the point of your post is that the Supreme Court has effectively outlawed incestuous marriage. That is not correct. It is only a ruling that incestuous marriage is not a right guaranteed by the constitution. However, the decision did not prevent states from passing laws banning incestuous marriage. That is what has happened. It is the Florida law that prohibits incestuous marriage that is being challenged in court. It is only that case that has been heard thus far. That case is the case of Snyder v. Grady, 04-50253, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3021 (E.D. Tex. 2005). The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on that case. It is still pending. But, it is only that case that is pending. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiff, then Florida's law banning incestuous marriage will be overturned. If the Supreme Court rules against the plaintiff, then Florida's law banning incestuous marriage will remain in effect. It is not my intent to confuse the issue. I simply do not know the facts of the case, and so cannot comment on the merits of the case. However, I have no doubt that the Supreme Court will uphold the right of states to ban incestuous marriage. What you are saying is that the law is not currently in effect. I am saying that the law is currently in effect. That is the relevant point. There is a big difference between having a law in effect and having the law on the books. There is also a big difference between having the law on the books and not having the law on the books. The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case that would make it legal for states to ban incestuous marriage. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiff, then incestuous marriage will be legal. If the Supreme Court rules against the plaintiff, then incestuous marriage will remain illegal."
Human,cmv-60,"To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out. So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other.

We need a good, sound, secular argument against incestuous marriage. Incest and Homosexuality 38 Responses to ""Why Incest Is Wrong"" What is your opinion on incestuous relationships that are not married? I don't know if I have an opinion. I think people should be free to do what they want as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. I think that's the only good secular argument against incestuous marriage. I personally have no problem with it, and the ""because it's gross"" argument against it is just as valid as the ""because it's gross"" argument against homosexuality. I think the incest argument is a strong one, and it supports the idea that marriage is about procreation. To be honest, I'm not sure how a pro-gay marriage person can't be pro-incest marriage. I am pro-incest marriage. In fact, I don't see why any type of marriage should be illegal, as long as both parties are consenting adults. No, it doesn't. It's an argument against incestuous marriage, not marriage in general. I don't see why any type of marriage should be illegal, as long as both parties are consenting adults. Incestuous marriage is a type of marriage. For me, marriage is about legal rights. If I'm a consenting adult, why can't I marry a dog or a chicken? I'm not going to have sex with it, I just think it's cute and I want it to be my legal spouse. I guess the only reason that incestuous marriage is a bad idea is because of genetic problems if the child inherits the genes of both parents. I don't know why you are having this discussion. What is the difference between a homosexual marriage and an incestuous marriage? Why is one good and the other bad? I think it's because there are different types of love. The love between parentchild and siblings is different from the love between a man and woman. The love between a man and woman is for the purpose of procreation. That's why incest is wrong. It distorts the purpose of love between a man and a woman. I'm not sure if I believe that, but I'm trying to think of a good argument. And I"
BigScience,cmv-60,"To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, a debate about whether or not legalized prostitution is immoral should be considered illegal because it violates human dignity. Of course this argument will never fly with all people, but those who do understand what 'human dignity' means should see why if we allowed prostitution then everyone wouldn't even need to worry about rape. In any case, Lawrence points out in his book ""The Moral Case for Marriage"" that it isn't wrong to defend an idea by using moral arguments when you can't represent your opponent's position as irrational (yet). This makes sense since most of us know something is true, so its just easier just to say it's right than trying to get around our own biases. So instead let's look at some practical issues related to divorce like child custodyvisitation arrangements; how much longer marriages last on average; etc... I think one reason many Christians believe they shouldn't allow gay couples to marry is because they feel that God wants them together AND He sees their relationship as sinful. But really? Maybe there could be another option still acceptable to both God and humans - like ""one man marries two women"" It seems reasonable for me to suggest moving towards either unacceptable behavior patterns among heterosexuals OR unacceptably long periods of time without sex between married partners.. The definition above only talks about sexual relationships specifically. Why don't we include physical abuse into consideration? For instance, imagine someone has clicked into pornography while watching television. The victim doesn't realize he's clicking into porn until he gets home from work. It's too late now and there's no way back unless the principal asks him. Is this tolerable under these definitions? Obviously yes! There must be more of a variety of reasons other than moral ones with regards to keeping children safe.. maybe strong parenting skills go along with being able to handle irresponsible teenagers better. Does anyone seriously want to argue that clergyman marrying boys up to 10 years older can somehow protect religious values?"

More power for them, greater control over society's resources, and all things in between. Unfortunately this trend towards increasing authoritarianism does not appear limited to political movements: I've often wondered why my parents were never anti-socialist or pro-business but are now. I'm curious if you can give us some insight into their thinking process or what might be going on with our country? For years I had only seen people like my mom talking about social justice issues but I've recently realized how much has changed since then also around here. My dad didn't like politicians at first either-his concern was government spending. He once told me: ""If we could cut taxes and still afford everything we needed...then I'd believe there really was anything worth saving!"" But I've learned he always thought governments should take care of basic necessities such as health insurance, schools etc., rather than focus too heavily on non-essential programs... He had to work hard after college because he wanted good education for his kids - even though he never earned any money doing that, he believed strongly enough in schooling to make sacrifices. It seems your father understood many principles of capitalism well before it became mainstream. And buying lottery tickets wasn't out of line with those ideas. (Even though no one ever said he won something big.) Both sides seem very passionate about making America bigger again and pulling away from globalization quite a bit in terms of trade policies. How do you think these will play out? What a perfect example of paternalism driven by fear. Most folks don't know where and when taxation actually ends and social welfare begins. It's laughable that anyone would argue otherwise; it's just plain ignorant. No doubt most Americans who support Trump wish for higher levels of government intervention similar to those proposed by Bernie Sanders, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Bill Clinton, George Bush Jr, John McCain Barack Obama. They're looking forward to earning back lost rights while simultaneously rewarded with new ones via progressive legislation introduced under the guise of alleviating poverty."

This is a dangerous trend, as it undermines the very principles of democracy that they claim to uphold. Democracy is based on the idea that everyone has the right to express their opinion, even if it is unpopular. This is essential for a healthy society, as it allows for different viewpoints to be aired and debated. When one group is able to silence the opposition, it creates an environment where only one opinion is allowed to be heard, which is a recipe for disaster. We have already seen the dangers of this kind of thinking in history. In the early 20th century, the Nazis used their power to silence any opposition, and this led to the Holocaust. In more recent times, we have seen how authoritarian regimes in China, Russia, and North Korea have used censorship to suppress dissent. The United States is not immune to this trend. In recent years, we have seen a number of attempts to silence those who disagree with the political left. This includes the firing of conservative professors from universities, the deplatforming of conservative speakers from social media, and the suppression of conservative voices in the media. This is a dangerous trend that must be stopped. We must defend the right of everyone to express their opinion, regardless of how unpopular it may be. If we do not, we will be setting ourselves on a path towards tyranny. Here are some specific examples of how social progressives have used their power to silence those who disagree with them:  In 2014, the University of California, Berkeley, canceled a speech by conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos after protests from students and faculty.  In 2017, Twitter banned conservative commentator Alex Jones from its platform for ""hate speech.""  In 2018, Facebook removed a number of conservative pages from its platform for ""misinformation.""  In 2019, Google fired conservative engineer James Damore after he wrote a memo criticizing the company's diversity policies. These are just a few examples of the many ways that social progressives have used their power to silence those who disagree with them. This is a dangerous trend that must be stopped. We must defend the right of everyone to express their opinion, regardless of how unpopular it may be. If we do not, we will be setting ourselves on a path towards tyranny."
LLAMA,cmv-61,"Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want to use that majority to ensure that those who dissent are censored, silenced, and eventually put in camps. I've often made the argument that the progressives are in favor of democracy because they do not understand it; they do not understand it, because they have never read the Federalist Papers. I think this is a pretty solid argument, but I'm not exactly a trusted source on this sort of thing. I'm a lawyer, and I'm not going to pretend that lawyers are all that objective about legal issues. So instead of continuing to make this argument, let's look at what the Federalist Papers have to say. First, what is democracy? According to the Federalist Papers, democracy is simple majority rule. In that sense, it is different from a republic, which is the rule of law, and it is also different from a constitutional republic, which is the rule of law that protects the minority from the tyranny of the majority. The Federalist Papers were written in order to convince the citizens of New York to ratify the US Constitution, so it's not surprising that they spent a lot of time discussing the shortcomings of democracy. In the Federalist Papers, majority rule was the rule of the mob. In the Federalist Papers, the democratic mob was compared to the mobs of the French Revolution. So, what was the role of the US Constitution in mitigating the problems of democracy? Well, the Constitution was intended to protect the rights of the minority from the majority. The Constitution was intended to ensure that the rights of the minority were not violated by the whims of the majority. In short, the Federalist Papers regarded democracy as a problem. Democracy was something to be avoided. Democracy was the rule of the mob. Progressives love democracy, and they love the mob, but the Federalist Papers did not. Thomas Jefferson was right: democracy is the rule of the mob. Democracy is the rule of the mob. Mobs do not protect the rights of the minority, and mobs will not protect your rights when you are in the minority. Mobs do not protect your rights, and you can't be free if your rights are not protected."

LLAMA,cmv-62,"It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing that is often overlooked is the power of cultural influence. China is one of the world's oldest civilizations, with a history dating back almost 5000 years. As a result, the Chinese have developed a culture that is distinctive and unique. This is also the reason why cultural exchange between China and other countries is so important. I think that in the West, the general perception is that China's cultural influence is weak. I would say that this is inaccurate. The Chinese have not only brought their culture to the world, but have also been able to absorb the cultures of other nations and adapt them to their own. China is known for its many adaptations of foreign ideas, such as the introduction of Buddhism to China from India during the Han Dynasty and the spread of Chinese script to surrounding nations. The Chinese language itself is evidence of the spread of Chinese culture. It is the most spoken language in the world, with over 1.3 billion speakers, and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. China is also well known for its cuisine, which is the most popular type of food in the world. However, as much as China has been able to export its culture to the rest of the world, it has also been able to import ideas and aspects of other cultures. In recent years, the Chinese have been increasingly influenced by Western culture. During the Cultural Revolution, the communist Chinese government tried to eliminate all foreign influences on China, but the end of the revolution and the new openness of Chinese society have allowed foreign ideas to infiltrate China. The most obvious of these influences is the increasing popularity of the English language in China. Another example of this is the large numbers of foreign tourists that visit China every year. In conclusion, China has a distinctive culture that has influenced other nations and has been influenced by them. By learning more about the Chinese, we can better understand their culture and how their perceptions and attitudes influence their views on the world. I totally agree that China is one of the oldest civilizations in the world and also the most powerful civilization on earth. I know that China has been influenced by many foreign countries. For example, China has changed their cultures, religions and lifestyle to be the same as foreign countries. However, I also believe that the Chinese culture has been spread out to many other countries. Since, China is a very big country, there are many ethnic groups. This means that China has many different cultures and religious beliefs. China also has many different languages. Therefore, many other countries are influenced by the Chinese culture and languages. For example, many other Asian countries have been influenced by the Chinese cultures and languages. Also, many other countries have also been influenced by China. This is because China has a very big population and has the highest population rate in the world. China is also a very powerful country with a strong economy.

However, one thing that is conspicuously absent from this discussion is the rising importance of the Chinese military. The Chinese military has been growing at an astounding pace, and will soon be the fourth largest in the world, behind the U.S., Russia, and India. That's a big deal. China is not only building new conventional military assets, but is also developing new types of conventional weapons, including stealth aircraft, guided missiles, and precision-guided munitions. I am not a big fan of Chinese power projection, and would prefer that China continue to concentrate on being a low-cost provider of cheap, good-quality goods. However, if China continues to grow at its current rate, it will soon be able to support a strong conventional military. If China ever comes to an international agreement to have a non-nuclear strategic deterrent force, it will be able to have one of the largest conventional forces in the world. That's not a good thing. It will also be able to field the largest conventional nuclear forces in the world, including 200-300 warheads on ballistic missiles. China is already a significant threat to Japan, and a much bigger threat to South Korea, which is already facing some serious threats from North Korea. China's growing military power is a potential threat to America's interests and its allies, and it will only grow. We should not be complacent about this."

However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is cultural influence. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole idea of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably. However, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY). The point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong."
BigScience,cmv-62,"It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I haven't heard anyone mention quite so much is their cultural influence. What do you think? Are we overestimating it or underestimating it? lewis China's culture has certainly had an impact on our lives but in very different ways from what most people believe. The Chinese have taken away many things that are important to us (most prominently Confucianism), including some schools of thought which were once dominant in Europe such as the Reformed Churches and Natural Theology. They also did not help this by importing Confucius into the West via Zen Buddhism who likewise took Confucian philosophy and turned it upside down with the idea that ""God is 'only' mind"" rather than ""one God in three persons."" Hence far too many Christians (particularly those following Eastern Orthodoxy) still remain steeped in Confucian thinking even though more recent studies suggest that it can be extremely damaging for Christian faith. (1) There must surely be something wrong if governments at both ends of the Atlantic Ocean are having problems believing religion is real! It seems strange to say Greece was using its strong military presence and naval fleet against Turkey because Greek citizens identified themselves as being ""on their side"" - yet there does seem to be little difference between how Israel acts towards Palestinians and how Greeks treat Turks! Bible Study In my Bible study group I often hear comments like: ""This verse makes no sense - why would Jesus tell his disciples to stay away from Sabbath work or worshipping until he returns again?!"" etc... However, these verses don't make any sense unless you read them within the context of overall New Testament doctrine where reference is made to ""the day of Christ""; i.e., God's return in power and glory to reign victoriously for evermore (2). Word of this glorious event will come through during times of persecution and tribulation (see John 16:33). One could argue that throughout history believers have been warned about persecution and tribulations coming upon the church so it's good news whatever happens! (3) (4) (5) Christianity Today I believe Christianity today continues to face similar challenges to what happened 1000 years ago: A clear majority of Western society sees faith as a private matter whereas only around 15 per cent actually practice it. Many churches feel pressure to conform to societal practices while others follow traditional patterns but fail to engage with new converts or non-Christians. Some people join organisations like Mormons or Jews without really knowing enough about either organisation to distinguish fact from fiction. We are challenged daily to affirm individual sovereignty and human choice. (See 1 Corinthians 1:27-28.) We should never forget the Parable of the Sower where each person's response depends on the seed sown beforehand (Matthew 13:1-30). (6)"
OpenAI,cmv-62,"It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing that is often overlooked is China's cultural influence. China has a rich history and cultural heritage that has been spreading around the world in recent years, through their cuisine, fashion, music, art, cinema, philosophy, language, and more. For example, Chinese cuisine has become increasingly popular worldwide, and many Chinese dishes have become staples of Western diets. Chinese fashion has also been gaining popularity, and many young people are embracing Chinese street style. China's music industry has been growing rapidly, with many Chinese artists achieving global success. Moreover, Chinese art is also making waves in international art markets, and Chinese cinema has been gaining critical acclaim in recent years with many films receiving international recognition. Furthermore, the rise of Mandarin Chinese as a popular language to learn means that more people are becoming interested in Chinese culture and learning about their societal norms and customs. Overall, China's cultural influence should not be underestimated as it is becoming one of the country's soft power assets in the world."

To remove a subreddit from your front page, simply click the subreddit, and then click the ""hide"" button. It's a pretty simple process that I'm surprised you don't know about. I love the idea of free speech as much as the next guy, but when free speech is literally promoting hate speech and when it's literally endangering other people's lives (e.g. by inciting violence against black people), then it's time for that speech to be shut down. The real question is, why do you think it's okay for Reddit to promote hate speech and violence? ecoff 8 points9 points10 points 11 months ago (0 children) It's not actually removing the subreddit.

The violence is in the action. So if someone is saying ""let's go do this thing that's not violent"" that's not inciting violence. If you don't like what someone is saying, it is easy to define it as hate speech and inciting violence. There's also a huge difference between someone saying ""I hate Jews"" and someone saying ""let's go do these things that will harm and kill Jews"" If you don't understand that distinction, you're probably a racist. thejoeshan 5 points6 points7 points 11 months ago (0 children) This is exactly the issue.

Tsinghua,cmv-63,"Reddit is a website, a business, it is the ""front page of the internet."" This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these groups and subreddits will not only provide the illusion of a safer community but also make Reddit a more appealing platform for people to share their content. Reddit should be a place where people can freely discuss their issues and concerns without fear of being shut down. What I am trying to say is that Reddit shouldn't be a place where ""hate speech"" is tolerated. Reddit has a lot of power, they can use that power to prevent hate speech and promote positive discourse. People who have seen this subreddit before, know that the user is allowed to speak his mind. It's not just about making a difference for the people who already know about it. It's also about taking a stand for the people who don't know about it. Frankly, this is a case of white-washing the problem. For example, if you look at the following screenshots, it would be impossible to tell what the subreddit is about. All you see is a bunch of links to other things. That's what Reddit's ""new"" whitewash does. It changes the discussion from one that's constructive to one that's destructive. The Reddit ""whitewash"" is similar to the Facebook ""whitewash."" What Facebook ""whitewash"" does is to change what you see on Facebook. The page may still be the same, but you are only given access to information that's good for you. For example, you can't see the comments on a post. In other words, the whitewash is like a filter that only shows you the positives. This ""whitewash"" is supposed to protect you from bad content, but what it actually does is protect the ""good"" content. So, instead of protecting you, it actually makes you more susceptible to bad content. If Facebook does this, it's because they want you to be able to access more ""good"" content. If you don't want to see the negative comments, then you should just avoid Facebook. If you want to see the negative comments, then you should just find another social network. I think the same thing should happen with Reddit. People should be able to read what they want to read, regardless of what they believe. What the whitewash does is to change the content from one that's constructive to one that's destructive. It's like Reddit is just giving people what they want to hear. The truth is, there is no such thing as ""hate speech."" What there is, is people who want to use the ""hate speech"" as an excuse to justify their actions.

The thread title says it all: reddit forum for sale! If any other site wants this, I'll gladly give up my domain nameaddress! I know how you're feeling because I've had many discussions about buying stuff on ebay, but nobody ever bought anything...:P I'm not complaining here at all. It's just something I'd like some advice on if it's possible. Why wouldn't anyone buy? Could be several reasons. On eBay, putting an item in your bid can also force someone else higher off your price. Sometimes it works; sometimes it does not (and then there's always another way around that). On Reddits, unless they're selling gold memberships andor T-shirts, there isn't usually any guarantee they'll sell even with high bids. And since a lot of things don't sell very often (especially on Reddit), most people aren't looking to spend time trying to find out why. Plus, when items go through auctioned bidding, prices tend to drop pretty quick so once someone raises the price too far, it's hard to compete against. A good example of where this happens was one set of wheels on EBAY. Someone dropped 400 on them in late October. They sold within 24 hours after being listed...but only for 100 less than the original price. You might want to try posting similar ads under different names as well. That'd probably work better than using the same username multiple timesthose sorts of restrictions may actually stop buyers from checking back repeatedly over a long period of time...

PaLM,cmv-63,"Reddit is a website, a business, and it is the ""front page of the internet."" This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these elements would make Reddit a more welcoming and inclusive place for everyone. Hate speech is a form of discrimination that can have a real-world impact on people's lives. It can lead to bullying, harassment, and even violence. Hostile ideologies can also be harmful, as they can promote intolerance and division. Reddit has a responsibility to create a safe and welcoming environment for all of its users. Removing hate speech and hostile ideologies would be a step in the right direction. It would send a message that Reddit does not tolerate discrimination or intolerance. It would also make Reddit a more welcoming place for people from all walks of life. There are many other reasons why Reddit should remove hate speech and hostile ideologies. For example, hate speech can lead to decreased productivity and innovation. It can also damage a company's reputation and brand. In addition, hate speech and hostile ideologies are simply not good for business. They can alienate customers and drive them away. A company that wants to attract and retain a diverse customer base should not tolerate hate speech or hostile ideologies. Reddit is a powerful platform with a global reach. It has the potential to make a real difference in the world. By removing hate speech and hostile ideologies, Reddit can help to create a more inclusive and welcoming world."
PaLM,cmv-64,"Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have been trying to convince me to give up meat altogether. They say that it's healthier for me, better for the environment, and more ethical. I'm not sure if I'm convinced yet, but I'm willing to listen to your arguments. Health One of the main arguments for going vegan is that it's healthier for you. There is some evidence to support this claim. A study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that vegans had a 15% lower risk of heart disease, a 31% lower risk of stroke, and a 13% lower risk of death from all causes, compared to meat-eaters. Another study, published in the journal The Lancet, found that vegans had a 24% lower risk of cancer, compared to meat-eaters. Of course, it's important to note that these studies were observational, which means that they can't prove that a vegan diet was the cause of the health benefits. However, they do suggest that a vegan diet may be associated with a lower risk of some chronic diseases. Environment Another argument for going vegan is that it's better for the environment. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and deforestation. A study published in the journal Science found that animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Another study, published in the journal Nature, found that animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of all freshwater pollution. Going vegan is one way to reduce your impact on the environment. By choosing not to eat meat, you can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and deforestation. Ethics Finally, some people choose to go vegan for ethical reasons. They believe that it's wrong to eat animals, and that animals should not be treated as commodities. If you're concerned about the ethics of eating meat, going vegan is one way to make a difference. Conclusion There are a number of reasons why people choose to go vegan. Some people do it for health reasons, others do it for environmental reasons, and still others do it for ethical reasons. If you're considering going vegan, it's important to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that's right for you. My Response I've heard all of these arguments before, and I'm still not convinced that going vegan is the right choice for me. Here are my reasons: Health I've been a vegetarian for 7 years, and I've never felt healthier. I eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and I get plenty of protein from beans, nuts, and seeds. I've never had any health problems that I can attribute to my diet, and I'm not worried about my risk of heart disease, stroke, or cancer. Environment I agree that animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and deforestation. However, I don't think that going vegan is the only way to reduce my impact on the environment. I can also choose to eat less meat, buy local produce, and reduce my energy consumption. Ethics I understand why some people are opposed to eating animals. I don't agree with factory farming, and I think that animals should be treated humanely. However, I don't believe that it's wrong to eat meat in general. I believe that animals can be raised and slaughtered humanely, and that eating meat can be a part of a healthy and sustainable diet. Conclusion I'm not saying that veganism is wrong. It's a personal choice, and what's right for me may not be right for everyone else. However, I don't think that going vegan is the only way to be healthy, environmentally conscious, or ethical. I think that there are many ways to live a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, and I'm choosing to do it my way."

My parents have a garden, and I have been helping to harvest the cucumbers and onions. My parents have been canning the cucumbers, which is a very tedious and hard process. When I told my vegan friends that my parents were canning cucumbers, they told me that it was cruel to the cucumbers and that canning was a horrible process. I had been considering going vegan, but now I'm not so sure. I don't want to be cruel to any animals, but if this is how cruel I am to plants, I don't want to go vegan. Any advice? Vegetarian, meat-eater, vegan, whatever your diet of choice, the very act of eating food is a cruelty that you can't avoid. The only way to live without inflicting pain and death on something is to live on sunlight and air and even then you're killing plants every time you walk on them. In this case, I think your vegan friends are being a little too extreme. I love how your vegan friends can justify killing an animal for food but can't handle killing a plant.

Human,cmv-64,"Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have been attempting to convince me that by my own utilitarian views, neither veganism nor vegetarianism are the most moral choice, and in fact, a gluttonous amount of meat is the best for environmental, ethical, and health reasons. So far, I've been able to counter most of the evidence offered to me either with my own evidence from trusted sources or by pointing out the lack of merit from the sources given to me (lots of comic sans blogs). This is something I do honestly believe that, given enough evidence, I would change my view on, and it seems like a lot of people seem to think they have evidence that a diet of meat is better in some way that I might consider meaningful, and of the many that do, there's bound to be some that might actually have something worth considering, so please change my view.:) EDIT: I should say that I'm posting this from an American viewpoint in which most of our factory farms typically don't treat animals very well. If you live in a country in which the animals are treated with respect and then eaten, that might be a different story, but that is not the situation that I am in.

BigScience,cmv-64,"Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends and family have come around. One thing that is really bothering me though are the too-close relationships between some people in my circle. Like...I know they aren't going out with each other or anything, but their friendships seem too close for comfort (not sure if that's even slang). I'm not into it at all, so I don't feel comfortable bringing up stuff like this over text messages - because we're supposedly on good terms right? My question is: how delicate i am dealing with this? Should we be getting along better by trying to keep things more civilized? (I'm just asking) Is there any etiquette involved here? A: As long as they're NOT dating nor engaged it's totally fine. Sometimes one person will try to play offended andor avoid talking to you when they see that you're uncomfortable around them. The rules of communication started changing from being polite towards being direct early in the 2000s. Nancy Manning states: ""There's no reason why email can't be used, but it's important to remember that writing emails doesn't mean you're communicating face-to-face."" In her book The Rules of Engagement (p.33), Nancy explains that she was able to get through University without ever having an actual conversation. She adds that talk to your classmates in the hallways and don't worry about whether anyone actually listens to you. Just go ahead and speak! It's also generally perfectly normal to criticize someone else's behavior or ideas through social mediaemails etc., especially since there's nothing wrong with doing so. Do you think this would affect our friendship negatively? No. If something happens where the person becomes upset about your criticism then obviously it's time to put boundaries in place. What you say must never, JAMAIS include personal information such as: ""You're making fun of me""; ""I'm hurtful""; ""This will ruin our relationship""; etc. You should always be careful who you expose yourself too much to. Another plus side of sharingcriticizing others online is that there is less risk of miscommunication. I share what I want; Your sensitivities won't matter. There's no obligation whatsoever. And now here's another question... Are these actions seen as rude? And should I respectfully ignore it or confront it? Rude behavior doesn't necessarily need to happen during a private message exchange. Even texting has evolved to support non-verbal cues such as: body language; facial expressions; tone of voice; tempo; pauses; silence; acknowledgment of receiptsentence length... etc. (Referenced below). If verbal insults were acceptable most businesses wouldn't exist. Even worse than insults could be: disrespectful attitude toward somebody trying to cause distractions telling lies To illustrate... ""I can't figure out why this guy keeps sending me those pictures! It's very rude"" is considered far harsher than ""I'm tired of his nonsense.. "" (please note that although this kind of metaphors may appear confusing.... they are quite common) Not only does physical contact make us feel physically well, but it makes us feel emotionally safe. Writing texts can provide similar feelings as holding hands while walking down the street. However, (even ignoring the fact that this is impossible due to COVID-19 etc.) When two people spend hours together they're bound to bump heads at some point. They'll inevitably disagree on topics related to: politics, religion, sports, entertainment, hobbies, TV shows, movies, fashion, food, relationships etc. Likewise they'll likely have different opinions regarding whom they should touch, hug how often, kiss how often, kiss under the table... etc. It might sound strange to you, but human beings are very intuitive animals. So what's the answer here? Obviously you've got to balance what's best for YOU based on: your own well-being vs. the well-being of others the context of the situation itself"
PaLM,cmv-65,"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read both types of books for years, and I've found that nonfiction is always more informative and thought-provoking. Fiction can be entertaining, but it doesn't usually teach you anything new. Nonfiction, on the other hand, can teach you about history, science, and other important topics. It can also help you to develop your critical thinking skills. One of the reasons why I find nonfiction to be more valuable than fiction is that it is based on facts. Fiction is based on the author's imagination, and it is not always accurate. Nonfiction, on the other hand, is based on research and evidence. This means that you can be more confident that the information in a nonfiction book is accurate. Another reason why I prefer nonfiction is that it can help you to learn new things. Fiction can be entertaining, but it doesn't usually teach you anything new. Nonfiction, on the other hand, can teach you about history, science, and other important topics. It can also help you to develop your critical thinking skills. When you read a nonfiction book, you are forced to think about the information that you are reading. You have to decide whether you agree with the author's arguments and conclusions. This helps you to develop your critical thinking skills. Finally, I find nonfiction to be more valuable than fiction because it can help you to understand the world around you. Fiction can be entertaining, but it doesn't always help you to understand the world around you. Nonfiction, on the other hand, can help you to understand history, science, and other important topics. It can also help you to understand the perspectives of different people. This can help you to become a more well-rounded and informed individual. Of course, fiction can have some value. It can be entertaining, and it can help you to escape from the real world for a while. However, I believe that nonfiction is more valuable than fiction overall. It is more informative, it can help you to learn new things, and it can help you to understand the world around you. Here are some specific examples of how nonfiction can be more valuable than fiction:  History: Fiction can be a fun way to learn about history, but it is not always accurate. Nonfiction books, on the other hand, are based on research and evidence. They can provide you with a more accurate and complete understanding of historical events.  Science: Fiction can be a fun way to learn about science, but it is not always accurate. Nonfiction books, on the other hand, are written by scientists who are experts in their field. They can provide you with accurate and up-to-date information about scientific concepts.  Current events: Fiction can be a fun way to learn about current events, but it is not always timely. Nonfiction books, on the other hand, are written by journalists who are reporting on current events. They can provide you with up-to-date information about what is happening in the world. Overall, I believe that nonfiction is more valuable than fiction. It is more informative, it can help you to learn new things, and it can help you to understand the world around you."
BigScience,cmv-65,"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read enough novels in my lifetime that I can say with absolute certainty that most are ways for an author (and editors) to extract as much money from their readers as possible. Fiction makes you feel good about yourself or at the very least gives you something else to do while you're waiting around on a bus ride or sitting down at your desk doing nothing. Nonfiction does not make you happy, it just tells you what has happened before - often people who have died long ago. You probably know more facts about them now, but it's still like reading someone's diary. The problem with literature is there isn't any real personal connection between us when we go into one. We don't get a sense in which we're being affected by what's happening in those stories. It becomes all too easy to take some dreamy and romantic idea that's floating through our heads, put them onto paper without having anyone really influence how we view things. It's almost tempting to make whimsical, naive decisions based solely off of these ideas because they seem so right. That's where art comes in though; sadly contemporary culture doesn't want to recognize this fact. They live in such a world full of reality-based content that they can't even believe anything beyond reality anymore. For example, when someone says that ""art"" shouldn't be taken seriously then I'm pretty sure they're actually saying that certain types of ""reality"" should be treated less serious."

It's just not worth investing in all these completely pointless stories when there are plenty which actually say something interesting about life (not necessarily accurate but nonetheless true). I'm an average reader who tends towards literary science-fantasy stuff rather scientific sci fihorror material such some Stephen King type work although if fantasy fans want me on their side for warring with elves?

LLAMA,cmv-65,"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read more nonfiction in the past year than I have in my whole life. The problem with nonfiction is that it is very difficult to just pick up and read for fun. It's not enjoyable to just sit and read it. The best way to read nonfiction is to read one section of it at a time and think about it for a while. For example, I was reading ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" and I was reading the first habit ""Be Proactive."" It made a lot of sense to me and I thought about it for a while. Then, when I had another free moment, I would read another section of it. The problem with reading nonfiction is that you'll just get a lot of information that you don't really know what to do with. You'll end up just forgetting it. The best way to read nonfiction is to just read a small section and try to understand what it means. If you read a small section, you'll have a better chance of actually remembering what you read. The biggest problem with nonfiction is that it's not enjoyable to read. Some people just don't want to read nonfiction because it's not fun. I'm one of these people. I find it boring to read nonfiction. The only way I've been able to read nonfiction is by reading a small section at a time and thinking about it for a while. I find nonfiction to be a lot more beneficial than fiction. I get so much more out of it. A lot of the time, when I read fiction, I just end up getting entertained and not much more. Sure, I enjoy it, but in the long run, I don't really get much out of it. I find that it's much better to read nonfiction, but I don't like the fact that it's not very enjoyable. The most important thing is to read nonfiction in a way that you can remember it. If you just read it like you would read fiction, you'll probably end up forgetting a lot of it. If you read a small section and think about it for a while, you'll have a much better chance of remembering it."
OpenAI,cmv-65,"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read many opinions on this topic, and there is no clear-cut answer. It all comes down to personal preference and choice. Non-fiction is often considered to be more factual and informative, whereas fiction is more imaginative and creative. Both have value and can provide readers with unique experiences. Non-fiction books can help readers gain knowledge and understanding of specific topics like science, history, and politics. This information can be useful in daily life and can enhance your career. Non-fiction books can also offer inspiration, motivation, and guidance for personal growth and development. Fiction books, on the other hand, can provide readers with an emotional and immersive experience. It allows readers to experience different worlds, different characters, and different lives. This can foster empathy, creativity, and imagination. Fiction books can also help readers develop their critical thinking skills and improve their language skills. Ultimately, there is no right or wrong choice when it comes to reading fiction or nonfiction. Both have their unique benefits, and what matters is what resonates with you and what you enjoy reading."

I've read more good nonfiction books than bad fiction books. I've read a lot of fiction books that were worth reading and a lot of nonfiction books that were really not. Terretta I was pretty sure I read a piece by you recently about how fiction is more intellectually rewarding. mjevans I agree. It's the author's intention to make you think and feel something. Nonfiction is often more interested in informing you, or maybe just telling you something interesting about a topic. Terretta Yeah, I've never read your stuff, but I read a piece by you recently that discussed why it is you read fiction more than nonfiction. I guess I should just search for it and read it. johnnybgoode The blog is well written, and there are some interesting topics here. But I'm not sure I see what the point of this was. I guess I'm wondering if the author was simply trying to find a more positive way to be critical of some of the worst parts of the Internet. I mean, if you're going to critique something, then you should do it with a bit of style. There's no point in writing an essay that sounds like a random collection of thoughts.

Human,cmv-65,"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read more fiction than nonfiction so let me give some examples. In the fiction category, I've read stephen king's ""the long walk,"" ""needful things,"" and ""the shining""; I've read pretty much all of crichton's books, and almost all of dan brown books. All are quite popular books. For comparison, the last 3 nonfictions I've read are [skunk works] ,"" the code book] ,"" and Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea] "" See, my view isn't that fiction is boring. However, in the limited span of time I have, I'd rather read 1000 pages worth of Introductory Chemistry, than 1000 pages worth of Needful Things; I'd have learned a lot more in The Code Book about cryptography than anything I would have learned from reading Jurassic Park (some basics about DNA and molecular engineering). Because it's such a time sink, the amount of enjoyment from reading fiction is not worth the time it takes to read it. (1000 pages would take 1-2 days to read; I'd rather spend those 1-2 days watching movies or doing other time-sinking things that provides a much greater amount of pleasure). On the other hand, reading 1000 pages of nonfiction, while it would take even longer time, but it would let me get more out of it to be worth my time.

Human,cmv-66,"Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice because its sort of half a rant too. I guess this is directed at a sort of liberalprogressive crowd, but can apply to right wing people too. Ever since atheism and anti-theism movement sprung up on reddit we have been bashing it. Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as ""free thinker,"" ""skeptic,"" ""reason"" and ""logic"" to push their agenda. And we used to (USED TO) have neckbeards spewing some obnoxious shit. And I agree they come off as cringy. But in general, mockery of religion is fun, really fun and FAIR! We laugh at bullshit ideas all the time. ""im an atheist but please be tolerant, let them believe"" or ""People believe different things"" or something similar. -We have such an agenda of tolerating christians because in the west because the majority is still christian, this also influences ""tolerant atheists"" subconsciously -We tolerate Islam because ""that is the religion those people in them middle east believe in"" so it would make us racist to criticize it. Like I get it Fox news is racist, but I dont have to be racist because I critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that I cant even. -We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler. (I actually understand this one though) -Mormons are made fun of, but mostly they get the same treatment as christians ""let people believe what they believe."" -We dont respect the views of other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc. Because? They are not a majority, nor taught to us before we could write. That is what I think most people choose to ignore. We dont have people spewing tolerance of religion because we have some genuine need to spare someones feelings. Its because christianity is popular, based on faslehood and people feel like their beliefs are under attack. When was the last time you saw someone going out of their way to defend a person who claimed to be a wolf? Oh, wait they get laughed at and mocked universally. Guy claims to believe hes literally drinking the blood of christ? Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard. Like seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like ""HAHAHA, you believe that?"" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt. The way I see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not ""hurt precious feelings."" I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled ""Euphoric"" or ""fedora wearing neckbeard."" I wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way I see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way I want our society to change its view is for people to watch all three videos below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality. Sincerely, I live in Norway so I recieve minimal damage from religion. I just wish religion did not have to have some protective shield and having it be taboo to criticize it because they will cry the loudest when mocked. People mocking stupid beliefs: - [1] - [2] - [3] Penn Jillette: Why Tolerance Is Condescending - [4] What would change my mind is either: -A huge amount of people going out of their way to prevent people from critizicing bullshit ideas such as Astrology, para-psychology etc. (people can believe what they want, tolerance, does not hurt you) -A huge appeal to mock christianity from its own communities. -Some source proving society not having a total hypocritical view of what bullshit ideas we are aloud to mock and not Hello, users of CMV!

PaLM,cmv-66,"Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice. I’m not going to mince words or pander to anyone, because I feel like that’s what’s gotten us into this mess in the first place. The truth is, we are living in a time of great uncertainty and division. The world is changing rapidly, and it seems like no one can agree on what the future holds. This is leading to a lot of fear and anxiety, and it’s only getting worse. In the midst of all this chaos, it’s easy to lose sight of what’s really important. We start to focus on the things that divide us, and we forget about the things that unite us. We forget that we’re all human beings, and we all want the same things: to be happy, to be safe, and to have a good life for our families. We need to start coming together again. We need to start talking to each other, and we need to start listening to each other. We need to find common ground, and we need to work together to build a better future for ourselves and for our children. I know that this is easier said than done. There are a lot of people who are working hard to divide us, and they’re not going to give up without a fight. But we can’t let them win. We have to stand up for what we believe in, and we have to fight for the future we want. We need to elect leaders who will represent all of us, not just the wealthy and powerful. We need to support policies that help everyone, not just the top 1%. We need to make sure that our voices are heard, and that our votes count. We can do this. We have to do this. The future of our country depends on it. So let’s put aside our differences and come together. Let’s start talking to each other, and let’s start listening to each other. Let’s find common ground, and let’s work together to build a better future for ourselves and for our children. We can do this."

LLAMA,cmv-66,"Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice since I will be stating my opinion on this. I have been a fan of the series since I got my 360, I have played every single game since then. I enjoyed the story and the gameplay mechanics that have been added to the series. I do not mind the 100 sync idea since I do not like to murder civilians and such. I enjoy the side missions more than the main story and I have many friends who have the same views. We all have played Revelations and we all enjoy it immensely. My reason for saying this is that you can not judge a game by its mechanics only, you must also judge the story. I have played through the game multiple times and I have not had any problems. The story is interesting, the new weapons and gadgets are cool, the puzzles were challenging (I mean the Hangman's Noose puzzle is very hard), and the combat system was the best it has ever been. I do not know why people are hating on this game. It is not as good as Brotherhood but it is not a bad game. I do not see why you are all complaining about the story and the combat system. I do not see a problem with either of them. The story is great. It is not hard to follow, it is not confusing, and it is fun to play through. If you do not like the game then that is your opinion. You do not need to make a forum post about it. This is a game people. Yes, I know we all have our own opinions but I believe this game is very good. The graphics are great, the story is great, the combat system is great, and the new weapons and gadgets are great. You do not have to agree with me, you can have your own opinion. I don't think the story is very good, it's boring as hell and it's the only game I felt like i'm going to stop playing after 3 hours. I liked the gameplay, but i don't think it's better than the one in AC2, ACB or AC2. The only thing that's good in the combat system is the fact that there are more weapons and the executions, but it's still the same system as before. I just don't like the combat system, i don't like it how you can't block and you have to kill everyone because of 100 sync, it's just stupid and i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who thinks that. Like i said, it's good to have your own opinion, but don't go flame other people because they have a different opinion. It was alright, but it really was no where near the same caliber as the other games. The plot was predictable, the combat boring, and the side missions were a total failure. I'm not trying to be mean, but if you think Revelations is a better game than Brotherhood, you are not very smart. It's a matter of quality, not opinion. Don't worry. You'll get used to it. Maybe you should get used to it. The combat system is not broken, I do not understand why you are saying that. If you have played through the game then you would know that they fixed the broken defense system. It is not broken, you have to counter and you can counter. You just do not like it because you can not counter. I would call that a player problem not a game problem. As for the story, I have not had any issues with it at all. I have been able to follow it with no issues at all. The story is not confusing to me at all and I do not see why you think it is. Yes, the story is not the best in the world but it is not bad. It is also not bad compared to Brotherhood. I do not know why you are comparing it to Brotherhood since that was a very good game. I agree with you about the side missions being a total failure. I hated the factions and the other side missions. I thought that they were pointless and I hated the faction system. I liked the original side missions from AC2. I wish they would have used those instead of the pointless factions. I liked the original side missions from AC2. I wish they would have used those instead of the pointless factions. And even if you did play the game it is clear that you did not have any issues with the game at all. You"

Human,cmv-67,"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on. I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible. Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. ""Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!"" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. ""The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!"" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect. The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

Tsinghua,cmv-67,"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that the Democrats had turned the election into a referendum on President Obama's first term. I'm not so sure. The first debate was mostly a prelude to the second debate. It was more like a big concert. You can't change people's minds in 30 minutes. It was really hard to get through the debate. I was amazed at the number of people who thought they were being funny. I know that some people will disagree with me. I'm sure that some people will think I'm the biggest idiot in the world. But, I can tell you that I was listening to a lot of comedians and pundits on the radio, and I didn't hear any jokes that were funny. I heard a lot of words and phrases that were repetitive and just weren't funny. In fact, I think that the best thing to come out of the first debate was the fact that Hillary Clinton went back to work. She is one of the smartest people in the world, and she is a formidable opponent. She has already done a good job of responding to a lot of the questions that the Republicans have asked her. I'm sure that there will be a lot more of that in the next debate. I know that the first debate was a prelude to the second debate. It was more like a big concert. You can't change people's minds in 30 minutes. I am curious to see how people respond to the second debate. The big question that I have is how much of the debate will be about jobs? The Democrats have an advantage in this debate because the economy is such a big part of the public's mind. So, I think that the Democrats have a good chance to make the second debate about jobs.

LLAMA,cmv-67,"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that he was lying, and that Obama didn't say that. Turns out, he did. What Huckabee said was, ""I still remember President Obama's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast. And he said, 'Unless we get on our high horse and think that this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.' Obama conveniently omitted that during the Crusades and Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. And in today's Middle East, radicals are doing horrible acts in the name of Muhammad. That's why we need to invite the Christians who are being persecuted all over the Middle East."" It was true. Barack Obama did say that, at a National Prayer Breakfast. He also said, ""Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history. And lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ."" When people pointed out that Huckabee was telling the truth, he posted this to his Facebook page: It would be nice if people would have the decency to just admit that Huckabee was telling the truth, and that this was said by Barack Obama. But no, the liberal media just goes on and on about how Huckabee was lying. The thing is, the only reason why Barack Obama went on a rant like that was because he was trying to defend Islam. He was trying to say that people have committed terrible deeds in the name of Christianity, just as they have in the name of Islam. That was a lie. The Crusades, and the Inquisition, were a reaction to the terrible deeds that Islam committed, and that they continue to commit. Labels: Christianity, Islam, Obama, Politics"

Tsinghua,cmv-68,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be required, and people will need to focus on self-improvement and education instead of the ""stuff."" Since self-improvement is hard, people will become even more attached to ""stuff,"" which means that things will get worse. Since there are fewer jobs, the cost of ""stuff"" will increase, which means that things will get worse. In short, if replacement rates are below the no growth rate, things will get worse, and if they are above the no growth rate, things will get better. And you'll see that in the charts below, even with population growth rates that are less than 0.25 per year, GDP growth is over 2 per year, and the income per capita has been increasing, despite automation destroying jobs. I'm not suggesting that you should buy real estate if the replacement rate is above the no growth rate, but I do suggest that you should buy real estate if the replacement rate is below the no growth rate. If you're looking for real estate in the Bay Area, it might be time to buy a home. I have been doing some research on Silicon Valley real estate and I've found some bargains. If you're looking for real estate in other parts of the world, I've found a few good opportunities. I've already purchased my own real estate in the United States, but I'm still looking for some bargains in Europe. The process is slow, and I have been waiting for over 2 years for a deal. But it's not too late to get started. Investing in real estate is a long-term proposition. If you wait for a good deal, you may never get one. So the process will take some time. But the good news is that real estate has continued to perform well in the past, so there's a good chance that you'll do well too. I've already purchased a house in the United States, and I'm looking for some bargains in Europe. The process is slow, and I have been waiting for over 2 years for a deal.

The report also found that about a quarter (24) said they had been laid off from their job over this past year while 15 reported being fired by an employer during last 12 months; 11 say someone else made them redundant which means more than one-third have experienced redundancy due working with machines replacing humans on any given day making it possible we might soon see humanoid robots doing our work - such is Professor Alan Winfield's prediction after studying how quickly AI has developed: ""Humans need not apply"""
Human,cmv-68,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result (s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement? Edit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view."
LLAMA,cmv-68,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available to the population at large. The only way to offset the job losses is to keep the population down. The higher the population, the greater the percentage of unemployed. In an ideal world, the population will be kept at the optimum level to provide for the maximum possible standard of living. Ideally, this should be done through natural causes and not through violent intervention. However, it may be unavoidable to make use of the force of the state to artificially limit the population. The government has no business in the bedrooms of the citizens, but we must do what is necessary to save our civilization from extinction. The only way to offset the job losses is to keep the population down. Some estimates put the rate of job loss at 50 by 2030. Automation will make jobs obsolete, as it has done throughout history. The difference now is the scale of automation. Let's say you are a prime-aged male with a high school diploma. You used to be able to get a job in a factory. That job is gone. It's been automated. Maybe you get retrained, college, a professional certificate, and now you are working in some white collar job. That job is also automated. Artificial intelligence can replace just about any job that exists. What are you going to do for work? I don't know. But I do know we have to address this. It's not something that's just going to work itself out. I agree that population is an issue, but automation is a much greater problem. If all the jobs are automated, then people will have to be supported by the state. It will either be a UBI or SMI or a combination. Let's look at the SMI model. It would give every citizen a stake in the economy. It's a way to share the productivity gains that we are going to get from automation. So let's say we have a high school diploma male who used to work in a factory and then retrained and got a white collar job. When AI comes along and replaces his job, he can go home and play video games, or he can go out and start a business or work in the public sector. He can do anything because his basic needs are being taken care of by the state. This is the social democratic ideal. The Social Market Economy is the best economic model. It's a balance between social democracy and a market economy. Germany's economic model is the best in the world. There are no strict ideological lines between the state and the private sector. It's a hybrid model that is designed to optimize both economic growth and quality of life. This is the model we should be moving towards. This is what the 21st century economy will look like. It's the best we can hope for. The only thing I don't agree with is the author's views on immigration. The author of the book is a conservative, so he's anti-immigrant. He's also a small business owner, so he's afraid of automation. He's worried about the AI revolution. He doesn't believe the state is going to give him a guaranteed income. But we are going to have to do that. And the only way we can do that is through immigration. If we don't have a growing population, the economy won't grow and we won't be able to afford the welfare state. The UBI and SMI are going to be funded through immigration. The labor movement can never be sustained without the influx of immigrants. Immigrants increase the size of the labor force and they increase the size of the consumer base. If we don't have population growth, then we can't have economic growth. So we need more people in the economy, and we need to support these people. Otherwise, the welfare state is going to go bankrupt. We are not going to be able to afford the UBI and SMI. So we are going to have to rely on immigration for population growth. Without immigration, the economy will stagnate. I think the UBI and SMI will be the only way to address the automation problem. It's the only way to transition to the AI"
OpenAI,cmv-68,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available for human workers. This means that a smaller population will be better able to sustain itself without excessive competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, with fewer people consuming resources, there may be less strain on the environment and ecosystems, which could improve overall quality of life for those who remain. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and cultural implications of intentionally reducing population numbers. Ultimately, finding a balance between population growth and sustainable resource use is key to ensuring a brighter future for all."
BigScience,cmv-68,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will need human interaction and more people can work from home. There is a constant debate about whether our society needs an inflation-like stimulus as we move towards a third ""great depression"" - which may well result if the pandemic does not subside soon enough, but I find it hard to believe that governments have collected all their reserves for this eventuality. (I am sure most economists agree). This should mean lower interest rates over time meaning higher money supply (MMT) ... But why would central banks keep sending out messages such as: ""we want you to put your money where your mouth is: lend dole-worthy amounts, give us high yields on government bonds etc., to enable us to buy up other assets with the proceeds like real estate? The problem now, however, is that they don't know what else would make them happy... The short answer is because the Federal Reserve has been buying almost everything including gold and silver since 2008. (see chart) In 2007-2008 when I was living in France, there were massive warnings by President Sarkozy against foreign investment into French property. He claimed that foreigners promptly bought every building under construction until prices doubled overnight! It seems that today's big players own far too much financial wealth and so legally cannot afford to sell any of it even though they could easily raise capital through easy lending! So allowing part of the global economy to shut down temporarily means they won't chase yields; they'll just let the profits offload themselves while keeping stocks low and encouraging economic activity elsewhere. We've got a lot of debt piling up here; private sector debt - mortgages, student loans, credit cards, car finance debts, etc.. Government debt swells as taxes go up! We're at nearly 25 trillion globally - 'only' 10 trillion of it domestically, although there's also 2.5 trillion of international sovereign debt. Of course, many US households already owe huge sums, either owing cash on hand, having borrowed after last month's paychecks went in or having taken on new lines of credit during COVID19 and never coming back online again.. Meanwhile, some large companies appear unable to repay their bank loans despite making regular payments:"
BigScience,cmv-69,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war waged on American soil. Militarily speaking it had no civilian casualties at all, but it's not what killed most Americans there. It's what happened to them when they came home from that land overseas that's rife with violence, drugs, and famine, and we're gonna call it ""the dark times"" because those were really black days for America. The civil rights movement that began in 1963 can't be understood without fully understanding how many men died... Not many. ...on American soil during World War II. There are two tragic incidents occurring right now, one here in Staten Island where Chuckie Hines has been shot dead by police officers, and another one down South, in Mississippi, where an innocent man named Michael Brown has also been gunned down by law enforcement officials. (reporting) The young African-American teenager, who lived nearby, said he wanted nothing more than to play basketball at his high school (speaking Spanish) But then he heard shots firing and ran toward the scene. And minutes later he found himself facing three white cops, who stopped him cold like he was nobody... and within seconds his life ended. Now you have the president saying... he's going to send 50 thousand troops into Iraq so we can end what's happening in Syria... (CNN reporter). Iraq's dealing with a lot of problems and some pretty serious ones including terror groups, ISIS, ISIL or whatever else they're calling themselves today. There's a lot of unrest outside of Baghdad itself as well and President Obama yesterday made sure if anyone wishes to take action against ISIS, let's do it together. (repeat speaker) What we're seeing these past few weeks, after September 11th, 2001, is a very different America. We've seen our military presence jump dramatically over several years from 7500 to 150 000 soldiers until finally reaching 300 000 across Afghanistan and Pakistan under Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn with their strikes in Libya and Somalia which led to some brutal fighting against al-Qaeda leading up to 911 back in '98 and early '99. Until recently our government would've never allowed its citizens to fight abroad and yet we've got 17 million active-duty service members in addition to 9 million veterans returning home every year. We could go through and list half-a-dozen conflicts currently taking place around the world and show you exactly why you're paying us to stay away. Since 1973 we have sent nearly 30 million troops to foreign lands to try save democracy, freedom and human rights everywhere. In fact, only 11 countries remain non-aligned with us; 9 don't want us anywhere near their shores. As long as the United States makes billions each year doing business inside nations that are dictatorships, behaving in ways that defy international laws and norms, supporting governments whose leaders break promises they make to their own people, fomenting ethnic hatred between peoples of different races, religions and colors, causing millions of refugees, drifting immigrants and others to come to our country seeking asylum, our country will get invaded again and again. Why does it seem impossible that everyone wants peace? Why doesn't everybody wish to live in harmony... Doesn't anybody believe still there's no better way to kill someone other than through firearm weaponry? (gunfire)... ..than shooting next door neighbor. Well, amongst other things, perhaps we cannot even talk about killing ourselves. (choir singing in Ukrainian) (man 1 yells in Ukrainian) (groans) For thousands upon thousands of centuries, man has used weapons to protect himself lf man did not use arms to defend himself, he'd be extinct alreadyand unfortunately over time weapons became more powerful as technology advanced. While gunpowder was once considered a hand grenade compared to today's chemical, biological, nuclear bombs; today it's nothing short of a joke since such weapons' destructive force far exceeds anything ever created before by any of man's inventions. This facility in Missouri has 36 giant steel tanks that hold 18 tons of liquid nitrogen and 24 tons of mercury. These 2 billion pounds of water vaporized chemicals fill air pressure tanks, propellant tanks and gas cylinders that produce enough energy to blow up 100 Michigan-sized buildings with bombs weighing 1 ton.

Tsinghua,cmv-69,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war against poverty, an attempt to bring democracy to the south. For most Americans, the war wasn't seen as a conflict, but rather a symbol of our need to help a poor nation. But when the government of Vietnam decided to go on the offensive, we had to fight back. We didn't want to get involved in Vietnam. I didn't want to go to Vietnam. But when I looked around at the world, I realized that the world was changing, that we had to be ready for that change. I had been a poor kid from a small town in Ohio. I'd had to struggle for everything I'd ever gotten. But once I joined the Army, I was suddenly a part of something that gave me the opportunity to give back to the world, to make it a better place. I'd seen a lot of things, had seen the world change around me, and had come to realize that the best way for me to make a difference was to fight for a cause I believed in. And that's what I did. I didn't go to Vietnam because I wanted to be a hero. I went to Vietnam because I knew that my country needed me, and that if I wasn't willing to fight for that country, then I had no business being in it. I didn't want to go to Vietnam, but I knew that I was there because my country needed me. That's what we all have to understand about war. We go to war because our country needs us. If you don't believe that, then you don't belong in the Army. I know that I'm not perfect. I'm still learning about the world and about life. But I know that there are certain things I believe in, and that if I have to stand up and fight for them, then I'm doing what I believe is right. I think about that every day. Every single day. The next day, after the meeting with Senator Snow, we had another breakfast with Congressman Simon and the local congressional delegation. We went over our plans for the day and what we needed to do to get ready for the arrival of General Petraeus. When we were done, Simon came over and shook my hand. ""Congratulations, Major. It's a real honor to meet you. I'm sure that General Petraeus will be pleased to meet you, too."" I smiled. ""Thank you, sir. I'm looking forward to it."" ""Good luck with everything. I'll be in touch with you tomorrow."" I nodded. ""Thank you, sir."" I walked over to where Mac had been sitting and found him standing next to Joe. He was staring out the window. ""Mac?"" He turned to me. ""You okay?"" ""Yeah. Just thinking about some things."" I smiled. ""Well, you should think about them. I can't imagine how much you're going to be able to learn about life in the Army, but you're not going to be able to learn it all in a year."" ""True, but there's a lot I don't want to forget."" ""Yeah, there is. And it's going to take a lot of effort to make sure you don't."" ""Yeah, I guess you're right."" He nodded. ""So, how's everything going with you and Sarah?"" I sighed. ""It's going okay."" ""Yeah? What's wrong?"" ""Well, it's just...there's a lot of things that are different now, and she's been having a hard time adjusting."" ""What things?"" ""Just...a lot of things."" I smiled. ""Like what?"" ""Like, for example, she's been going to the school, and all of the kids and the teachers know her, but I don't."" ""So?"" ""So, it's just...it's been hard for her to make friends here. She's not like you or me, and she's not like most of the kids here."" ""I don't know, Mac. You've been here a long time. You've made a lot of friends here. You've probably made a lot of friends in the Army. I'm sure that Sarah's friends are just as good as any of them."" ""Yeah, but they're not."" I sighed. ""Look, it's going to take a little time. It's going to take some effort on both of our parts, but I think we're both ready to make the effort. I think we're both ready to make it work."" ""Yeah, I guess you're right."""
PaLM,cmv-69,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war of aggression on the part of the United States. We had no business being there, and our involvement only served to prolong the conflict and cause needless suffering. I'm not saying that the Vietnamese people were blameless. They were certainly capable of violence and atrocities of their own. But the fact remains that we were the aggressors in this conflict. We were the ones who invaded their country, and we were the ones who killed innocent civilians. I'm not trying to whitewash the actions of the Vietnamese government or the Viet Cong. They were responsible for their own share of war crimes. But I think it's important to remember that we were not the good guys in this war. We were the invaders, and we were the ones who started the fighting. I know that a lot of people still believe that the Vietnam War was a necessary war. They believe that we were fighting to stop the spread of communism, and that we were defending our allies in South Vietnam. But I think that's a simplistic view of the conflict. The truth is that the Vietnam War was a complex and tragic affair, and there are no easy answers. I'm not saying that we should forget about the Vietnam War. We need to remember the sacrifices that were made, and we need to learn from the mistakes that were made. But we also need to be honest about the role that we played in this conflict. We need to acknowledge that we were the aggressors, and that we were responsible for a great deal of suffering. I think that the Vietnam War is a cautionary tale. It's a reminder of the dangers of war, and the importance of diplomacy and peace. It's a reminder that even when we believe we're doing the right thing, we can still make terrible mistakes."

Human,cmv-69,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best. I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves. Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea. Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated.

OpenAI,cmv-69,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a disastrous war, both in terms of military operations and as a moral and political issue for the United States. The war was unpopular from the start, with many Americans questioning its purpose and the morality of US involvement. Over time, the war became increasingly costly and deadly, with no clear strategy for victory. The war also had significant social and political consequences, heightening tensions between different groups and amplifying doubts about the government's credibility and its ability to govern effectively. The war also sparked a wave of protests and activism, particularly among young people, who saw the conflict as a symbol of larger systemic issues such as inequality, racism, and the abuse of power. As a helpful assistant, I would encourage you to continue exploring the many complexities of the Vietnam War and its impact on American society and politics. By understanding the past, we can learn valuable lessons that can help us build a more just and equitable future."
BigScience,cmv-70,I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point about this.
OpenAI,cmv-70,"I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really valid point here. Additionally, English is only the third most spoken language in the world, behind Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. It's not fair to force people all over the world to learn a language that may not be relevant to their own culture or daily life. Furthermore, it perpetuates cultural dominance and can suppress other languages and dialects. It would be better to have a system in place for effective translation and interpretation services, as well as promoting the use of multiple languages in international communication."
Human,cmv-70,"I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point in another thread I saw. Other languages such as Spanish the pronunciation of a word is pretty straight forward. I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e). Also English is not even the most spoken language in the world where Mandarin is first followed by Spanish. English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise. Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million. I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were. I didn't defend Mandarin because I've always had the impression of it being one of the hardest language to master. If it's otherwise I apologize and anyone who speaks other languages are welcome to support why your language should be the international language. Hello, users of CMV!

LLAMA,cmv-70,"I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point about how hard it is to learn English. Why English Should Not Be the International Language This is the first day I've heard that English should not be the international language. The reasons he gave were: 1. There's a lot of synonyms, and they have different meanings. This is how the English language is, and I'm not sure if it should be changed. 2. English is a very difficult language to pronounce. 3. The pronunciation of English is difficult for foreigners to understand. 4. English is a very difficult language to learn. 5. There are many irregular verbs. 6. There are many irregularities in the pronunciation of words. 7. There are a lot of rules and exceptions in English. There are a lot of irregularities in this language, and it would be very hard to change. English is a very difficult language to learn, and it would be difficult for foreigners to learn."
PaLM,cmv-70,"I think English should not be the international language for these reasons:  It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words. Here uBrotherChe makes a really good point. There are many words in English that have multiple pronunciations, and even native speakers often get them wrong. This can make it difficult for non-native speakers to understand English, especially when they are listening to it being spoken quickly.  English is a very complex language with a lot of rules. This can make it difficult for non-native speakers to learn. There are many exceptions to the rules, and even native speakers often make mistakes. This can make it difficult for non-native speakers to communicate effectively in English.  English is not the most widely spoken language in the world. According to Ethnologue, there are over 6,500 languages spoken in the world, and Chinese is the most widely spoken language with over 1.1 billion speakers. English is the third most widely spoken language with over 500 million speakers, but it is not spoken as widely as other languages such as Spanish, Arabic, and Hindi.  English is a colonial language that has been imposed on many people around the world. This can make it a symbol of oppression and colonialism for some people. It is important to consider the historical context of English when discussing its role as an international language. I believe that these reasons are sufficient to show that English should not be the international language. There are many other languages that are more suitable for this role, such as Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, or Arabic. These languages are more widely spoken, easier to learn, and do not have the same colonial baggage as English."
Tsinghua,cmv-70,"I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point in that you have to pronounce the same thing a lot of different ways to be understood by everyone, and that's not really a good idea. If you're a native English speaker, you may have a very strong preference for a particular way to say something, but for a non-native speaker, they'll need to work a lot harder to understand you. Also, I don't think that English should be the only language of the world, as it would be too limiting for other languages. We can learn English as a second language, and we should be allowed to learn it. English is not the only language that has a huge market, and so it would be unfair for the other languages to have English as their only language of communication. I think that it would be unfair for English to be the only language of the world. It would limit other languages, as English is not the only language that has a huge market. It is also not the only language that is widely spoken, and so it would be unfair for other languages to be excluded from using English as their only language of communication. Also, it is not a very good idea to limit the use of a language that is not your first language. The fact that many countries speak English as a second language does not make English a better language. In addition, there are other countries that do not speak English as a second language, and so it would be unfair for them to be forced to learn English. Finally, it is not very practical for everyone to learn English as their only language of communication, and so it would be unfair to force everyone to learn it.

Human,cmv-71,"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling ""invaded"" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. So here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and ""dark side"" of reddit. Edit: reply from rnannyhap produced new idea that perhaps having a place that tolerates hateful views makes for an artificial influx of them. Doesn't quite change my view all the way but definitely something I hadn't considered. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

BigScience,cmv-71,"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as an information distribution hub it was wonderful but, if you take away its foundations of how it works and what things are allowed to be posted, it's just another big social media platform. So ultimately we need something like Quora for Black users where they can have their own space. If people want to actually get help from experts in their communities that's fine - but at the end of the day there needs to be more spaces to express yourself outside the mainstream culture."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-71,"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned like many Gawker employees do, then people could get away without calling out sexism or racism in public because they knew there would be little consequences for doing so openly within their own group of friends and coworkers - which fostered an environment where harassment was rampant among users who were rewarded by rising to positions as mods at various subreddits (iirc). In short: The problem isn't just one man's actions - It represents every person participating here when hidden behind anonymity regardless if you agreedisagree his behavior should have been tolerated[1]. As such we can ignore those claiming ""he himself said he did nothing wrong"" until some sort [2]of transparency occurs regarding how things are run inside these private communities.[3] (and i'm not saying anything about what happened from other reddit administrations)"
OpenAI,cmv-71,"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as a platform that allowed for open discussion and diverse perspectives, it was able to provide a space for people from all backgrounds to engage with and learn from one another. However, as the community has grown, it has become increasingly homogeneous, with many users feeling excluded or silenced due to their race or gender. This has contributed to the echo chamber effect that can be seen on many subreddits, where only certain voices are heard and other perspectives are dismissed or attacked. It's important for Reddit to address this issue and work towards creating a more inclusive community that values diverse opinions and experiences. This can be done through measures such as actively recruiting and promoting users from underrepresented groups, enforcing anti-discrimination policies, and creating safe spaces for marginalized communities to share their perspectives without fear of harassment or backlash. Only by acknowledging and addressing these issues can Reddit truly realize its potential as a platform for open discussion and learning."
Tsinghua,cmv-71,"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as a community of primarily White men it was great. But as it has evolved, it has become a large forum where the only people who matter are White men. It is a space that has been designed to be exclusively White male. The rest of the world is just noise. And the fact that a large number of these people think that they are the sole and authentic voice of the ""men's rights"" movement is just a great illustration of that. What is the point of having a forum that is built for a specific group of people when you don't provide anything that the general public can use? If the site is to be useful to anyone it has to be for everyone, not just one group. But Reddit doesn't care about that. It is not a place for anyone who is not a white male.

Tsinghua,cmv-72,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that there are way too many people who have gone to prison in the United States and have simply been victims of their own decisions. Granted, it is a problem with the economy, and it is not a victimless crime, but I do not believe that there is any solution to this problem. What is the problem with the drug war and victimless crimes? It is that the drug war is a way for the government to control people. If we could get rid of the drug war, we would have more control over our own lives. That is what I believe is the problem. I have always been a law-abiding citizen, and I would like to stay that way. I am a 100 supporter of the drug war. What I do not like is the idea that we have so many innocent people who have gone to prison. What do you think should be done about this? Well, it is my opinion that we should make the law stricter. The problem is that it is hard to change laws, and we have a lot of people who are opposed to stricter laws. I am against harsher laws. I think that people who are in prison should be punished for their actions. If you are not in prison, you are probably going to commit a crime. That is what I believe. I think that people should not be in prison just for being poor. What do you think should be done to reduce the number of people in prison? Well, the best thing that we can do is just reduce the amount of people in prison. I do not think that we should just let people go. That is just too easy, and it will just encourage more people to commit crimes. It is not that we should lock people up, but it is that we should not just let people go. What is the best way to deal with the drug war? Well, the best way to deal with the drug war is to just do away with the drug war. That is what I believe. It is too easy for the government to get people to do drugs. They could make it illegal, but that is not going to solve the problem. We could also make it so that people have to pay for their own drugs, but that is not going to solve the problem. The best way to deal with the drug war is to just do away with it. What do you think about the drug war? I think that it is a terrible way to deal with drug abuse. The drug war is just a way for the government to get people to do drugs. They could just make it illegal, but that is not going to solve the problem. What do you think about the prison-industrial complex? Well, the prison-industrial complex is a huge problem.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-72,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and they needlessly cost tax payers billions every year while most prisoners end up coming out worse for wear than when their life sentence started in day one at county jail or state penitentiary - simply because there is little support from familyfriends after release due a lack on job skills training etc among other things; therefore creating more victims as well). I would prefer rehabilitation programs over imprisonment by far if given half an opportunity... however this often isn't considered 'politically correct'...or even politically viable so offenders get punished regardless with no real results achieved through such extreme sentences.. which only creates further broken lives once exiled back into society without proper reintegration strategies planned ahead during incarceration time otherwise you'll just create another dysfunctional underclass upon return home! This makes me extremely sad: ("
LLAMA,cmv-72,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that too many people are in prison for too long and that the punishment doesn't fit the crime. As long as we have prisons, though, we should do our best to make them safe, humane and rehabilitative, and I believe that many of them, including the maximum-security facilities, are not. Here's the problem with that. I'm a coward, and I can't bear the thought of being locked up for any amount of time. When I was a kid and my mother would threaten to ""send me to jail"" if I didn't do something she wanted me to do, I would cry and beg her not to. I would say that I was sorry. I was sorry that I had been bad, and I was sorry that I wouldn't be able to behave myself. She would always say ""I'm not going to send you to jail"" in that exasperated tone of voice, and I would always feel a little better. So, the thought of being in prison is really scary to me. I just don't know how to handle it, so I'm hoping that you can help me. You're probably asking yourself right now, ""Why would I want to help this guy?"" and I understand that. I'm going to tell you why you should help me: I have a lot of useful skills. I'm a skilled carpenter, and a decent electrician. I can cook. I can do your laundry. I can clean. I can do all sorts of things. So, I'm going to need to know the following: What do you do to get along with the guards? What do you do to get along with your fellow prisoners? What do you do to get along with gangs and gang members? What do you do to get along with other prisoners who don't get along with gang members? How do you earn a living? Do you have any particular advice for a transsexual woman? Do you have any particular advice for someone who is at risk of being raped? How do you get things that aren't allowed, like extra food? I have a lot more questions, but I'll let you know when I think of them. Thanks, and I hope to hear from you soon! Cory, if you can't handle the thought of being in jail, don't go there. It's that simple. Don't do anything to get yourself locked up. If you're worried that you're going to slip up and do something to put you in the can, ask a trusted friend to watch out for you. I am not the person to be asking for advice on the subject of ""getting along"" in prison. I got along just fine, but I also got myself killed in there. It was a complete accident. I wasn't a tough guy. I didn't take any crap from anyone. I treated people with respect. In turn, I was respected. The guys I ran with were as solid as anyone can be, and I was pretty happy with my situation. I worked out a lot and I took pride in myself. I was a little guy, but I was strong and fast and I knew how to fight. I was smart and I could be funny. I had good friends, and I was liked by a lot of people. I had the respect of the administration and the guards, and I had a good job in the prison kitchen. I was doing good time. I also had a very bad temper. I was always getting into fights. I didn't care what happened to me as long as I could get a shot in on the other guy. I'm sure you can see how that kind of attitude might lead to trouble. I did my last bid in a maximum security prison. I'd been there before, in other prisons, but not in a place like that. It was the kind of joint where you might see a guy get knifed to death in the middle of the yard. In fact, I did see that, and it was a mess. It was a mess for a long time after, too. A lot of guys tried to get me to join up with a gang while I was in there. I always refused. I had nothing against gangs, but I didn't want to be a member of one. I had my own friends, and I was close with them. The gangs were okay by me, as long as they left me alone. I never"
Human,cmv-72,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm - directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for. Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay. One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit. Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way.... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.

BigScience,cmv-72,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and there is a lot of money being found in this system for various right-wing groups. Secondly, however, we can't ignore what we have here. After all, if you go into an interview with someone who works at or has worked at one of these prisons and ask them how they got their job, essentially your answer will be something along the lines of: ""It was easy! There were so few qualified people out on the market."" That's not how things work. You must first prepare yourself through schooling, experience andor networking - otherwise you'll find you get hired because no one's really looking for somebody like you. (In my case, when I applied to EWR last year, 75 of applicants had college degrees, but only 4 received offers; that's why it's important for me to network.) This situation can also apply to entry-level positions within correctional systems as well. In most states, very little goes towards helping inmates obtain employment after release, and those programs aren't always effective either - particularly since most offenders tend to lack education and aptitude related skills outside of incarceration anyway. I don't want to say any more than that about getting employed inside corrections - I'm just trying to point out some facts where you need to prep properly before applying for any position 'cause you're never going to win hands-down unless you've done enough research and preparation beforehand. When I originally started working at EJR in 2013, both administration and staff members omitted much information from our contracts regarding pay rates. Because of this, I made over 200Kyear between 2014-2016 without knowing until after leaving 3 months later! So even though there is plenty of discussion online about whether it's fair to make such huge salaries in the private sector given current economic conditions - it doesn't matter if they're still making good money now. The fact remains that it used to take longer to earn that kind of money in corrections compared to today - and while everyone agrees that public service shouldn't be paid nearly as high simply due to the additional benefits offered by the government... sometimes the buck stops further down the line - especially when you consider retirement costs associated with long tenure."

Under the Assembly Bill 92, anyone who tells a false declaration or omission on hisher application for passport will not be allowed to travel outside India under that passports. For example, if you do not know what language (s) do you speak and want to apply for English - yes, I have seen applications where it says Indian but as per my knowledgeexperience, this would mean Hindi or Urdu (or maybe something else). So not just knowing one foreign language alone does NOT entitle someone to get a passport with multiple languages of residence! So guessing from your query, there's no dearth to get the correct information before applying so please bear those points mind when going forward!"
LLAMA,cmv-73,"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the current law, if you knowingly give a false statement to a federal officer, you are guilty of a felony. You can get the maximum sentence even if you don't actually lie to the officer. If you just conceal a material fact, you are still guilty. If you give a false statement, but later change your story and tell the truth, you still committed a crime. Although it is a very serious crime, it is also one that is very rarely charged. Instead, this law is often used as a threat to encourage people to be cooperative. For example, if someone is being questioned in a corruption investigation, they might be told that lying to the agents will be a separate crime. Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee are planning to introduce legislation to amend the law. They have stated that the current law is overly broad and not very useful. According to Senator Hatch, the law makes it a felony to tell a misleading joke to a federal officer. Senator Lee has said that the law is ""particularly problematic for the most innocent people."" The proposed legislation would change the law so that the crime would only be committed if a person lies to a federal officer to obstruct an investigation. The proposal would also change the crime from a felony to a misdemeanor. The proposed law does seem like it would better target the types of behavior that should be criminal. However, Senator Hatch and Senator Lee may not have a lot of support for their proposed changes. As of right now, it seems that there is little support for the proposed law. It appears to be especially opposed by groups that want to protect government agencies from corruption. It is an interesting proposal, and one that may gain more support in the future."
Tsinghua,cmv-73,"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the Obama administration, federal prosecutors have filed over 200 false statements charges. And according to a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union, those numbers are likely much higher, because many of the cases have not yet been adjudicated. ""In the last few years, the Justice Department has made a big push to go after false statements,"" said Shaun Donovan, a former federal prosecutor who now heads the ACLU's criminal law project. ""The idea that you could be prosecuted for lying to federal investigators has never been tried before."" Lawyers and judges say the new statute is vague, leaving prosecutors and courts to interpret the law. They say it will require prosecutors to prove that the defendant intended to lie to federal investigators. In cases where federal agents are investigating a crime, that can be difficult. Prosecutors must prove that the defendant intended to tell the truth when he or she spoke with federal investigators. Donovan said it was unclear how prosecutors would prove that intent. ""It is hard to prove a negative,"" he said. The statute also makes it a crime to ""willfully and knowingly"" mislead a federal investigator, a phrase that can be interpreted in different ways, Donovan said. The law's vagueness could have dangerous consequences, lawyers and former federal prosecutors say. The ACLU has sued the government on behalf of two men who were prosecuted under the statute. They said that they were not trying to lie to federal investigators when they answered their questions truthfully. ""If you tell the truth, that is not lying,"" Donovan said. ""That's not a crime."" But in a court filing last year, prosecutors argued that they were not asking people to lie. They said the new law was not designed to punish truthful responses to federal agents, but to deter lies. The government also argued that the statute is not vague. It said that prosecutors can decide whether someone is lying based on the context of the conversation. ""When asked whether they were truthful, defendants made it clear that they were,"" prosecutors wrote. ""Thus, it is apparent that defendants were not trying to mislead the federal agents, but rather were being truthful in their responses."" Prosecutors have the power to decide what laws they will enforce. But Donovan and other legal experts say that they should not be able to do so in a way that punishes truthful answers to federal agents. ""It's a lot of power to give the government to decide whether someone has lied to federal agents,"" Donovan said. ""I don't think it should be that way."" But the government's interpretation of the law has at least one supporter. In 2015, federal prosecutors charged four men in New York with violating the false statement statute. Two of the men, the son and brother of a New York City police commissioner, were convicted of lying to federal investigators. The son, John F. Kennedy Jr., was sentenced to three years in prison, while his brother, Edward Kennedy, was sentenced to two years in prison. Kennedy Jr., a former special counsel to the New York state attorney general, was accused of lying to federal investigators about his involvement in a political donation scandal. He pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement. His brother, who served as a congressman, pleaded not guilty."

Human,cmv-73,"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the current law, it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal agent. This law is routinely abused by the government to give them leverage over defendants. [Ken White at Popehat describes how:] Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie - for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You - having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer - obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material - but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government. Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works - even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge - a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations. I think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner. Also, I think the penalty should be much less severe, more like a misdemeanor. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

OpenAI,cmv-73,"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the federal law, it is illegal to knowingly and willfully make a false statement or provide false information to any federal law enforcement officer or agency. This law is designed to help federal agents and officers in their investigations and to prevent obstruction of justice. It is important to always be honest and truthful when speaking with federal officers and to never provide false information or make false statements, as it is a serious offense that could result in significant legal consequences."
PaLM,cmv-73,"Currently, it is a crime to lie to any federal officer. It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the current federal law, it is a crime to knowingly and willfully make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the United States government. This law is intended to protect the integrity of the federal government by ensuring that federal officials are able to obtain accurate information from the public. It is also intended to deter people from lying to federal officials in order to gain an advantage or avoid punishment. The law is very broad and can apply to a wide range of situations. For example, it could apply to someone who lies to a federal agent during an investigation, or someone who lies to a federal judge during a trial. It could also apply to someone who lies to a federal agency in order to obtain benefits or avoid punishment. The law is enforced by the Department of Justice. If someone is convicted of violating the law, they could face up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. There are a few exceptions to the law. For example, it is not a crime to lie to a federal official if the lie is made in good faith and is not material to the matter at hand. Additionally, it is not a crime to lie to a federal official if the lie is made in order to protect oneself or another person from imminent harm. Despite the exceptions, the law is still very broad and can apply to a wide range of situations. This means that it is important to be aware of the law and to avoid lying to federal officials whenever possible. Here are some examples of situations where it could be considered a crime to lie to a federal officer:  If you are being interviewed by a federal agent during an investigation, you could be charged with lying if you knowingly and willfully make any false statements.  If you are applying for a federal job, you could be charged with lying if you knowingly and willfully misrepresent your qualifications.  If you are filing a federal tax return, you could be charged with lying if you knowingly and willfully underreport your income.  If you are applying for federal benefits, you could be charged with lying if you knowingly and willfully misrepresent your eligibility. It is important to note that the law does not require that the lie be intentional. Even if you make a false statement by mistake, you could still be charged with lying if you knew that the statement was false or if you should have known that it was false. The law also does not require that the lie be material to the matter at hand. This means that you could be charged with lying even if the lie does not affect the outcome of the investigation or the decision-making process. The law is intended to protect the integrity of the federal government and to deter people from lying to federal officials. If you are ever in doubt about whether or not a statement is true, it is best to err on the side of caution and avoid making the statement."

The field of data science and machine learning is rapidly growing and becoming more important in many industries. Since you already have some experience with web scraping, I would suggest you start by learning some programming languages and tools that are commonly used in data science and machine learning, such as Python, R, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. You can take online courses or tutorials to learn these tools and languages. There are many online resources like Coursera, edX, Udacity, and Khan Academy, where you can learn the basics of data science and machine learning. Also, it is essential to remain updated about the latest developments in these fields, so it would be a good idea to follow some prominent data scientists and researchers on social media, attend conferences, and read research papers and articles to stay up-to-date and learn more about the latest trends and developments in this field. Try out some hands-on projects and explore open data sets, learn how to preprocess data, visualize it, build models, and evaluate their performance. This will help you build a portfolio and develop your skills in data science and machine learning."

LLAMA,cmv-74,"I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites to get data. It was fun, but I knew there was more to it than just scraping and dumping data into an Excel file. I wanted to do things like understand user behavior, predict how long someone will stay, etc. I started learning about machine learning and data science when I joined Springboard. I'm in the middle of the course. I've learned a lot about how to understand and work with data and how to apply machine learning concepts. I'm currently doing a project with Kaggle data to predict how long someone will stay at a hotel. I'm learning how to work with data, clean it, and apply different models to predict different things. So far, I've learned a lot about data and how to work with it. I've learned how to use a lot of tools, and I've learned about a lot of different machine learning techniques. I've also learned about different types of data and how to structure it. My mentor has been really helpful. He's been good at explaining things in different ways and making sure I understand. We have weekly meetings, and we also meet once or twice in between to go over my project. How has Springboard helped you in your job search? I haven't started looking for jobs yet. I'm just starting to finish my project. But I think Springboard has given me confidence that I can actually do this. I used to be really afraid of data, but now I'm much more comfortable with it. How have you balanced Springboard with your full-time job and your personal life? It's not easy, especially in the beginning. I had to find a way to balance it all. I started taking some shortcuts at work to save more time for Springboard. I also learned how to manage my time better. I started doing some work on the weekends to make up for the time I lost. I've always enjoyed learning, and I think it's really important to continue learning. At first, I was worried that it would be hard to learn new things while working full-time, but I was able to do it. If you're thinking about doing a bootcamp, make sure it's something that interests you. When I was first learning about data science, I didn't understand it, and I thought it was boring. But when I actually learned more about it, I realized it was really interesting. I'm glad I stuck with it."

As a helpful assistant, I would suggest that it is important to recognize the many positive attributes of these democratically elected governments, while also remaining aware of the challenges they face and advocating for policies and initiatives that can improve the lives of all citizens."
PaLM,cmv-75,"In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by people who came from places like India, China, Japan, and Korea. There are many reasons for this, but one of the most important is that people from these cultures tend to have a strong work ethic and a desire to succeed. They are also more likely to be educated and have the skills that employers are looking for. In addition, people from these cultures tend to be more respectful of authority and more willing to follow rules. This makes them easier to work with and more likely to be successful in business. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. There are many people from these cultures who are lazy and unsuccessful. But overall, people from these cultures tend to be more successful than people from other cultures. This is why so many of the most desirable places in the world are run by people from these cultures. They are the ones who have the skills, the drive, and the respect for authority that are necessary to make a country successful. Of course, there are many other factors that contribute to a country's success. But the culture of the people who live there is one of the most important."

A dog that thinks is not the same as a dog that acts.

Human,cmv-76,"First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of communication could hardly be any more different from ours. A dog leaping onto you is not expressing affection; it's literally asserting dominance. A dog dragging you by the leash is not eager to play; it's showing you who the top dog is and ordering you to follow the pack leader (itself). A dog making eye contact is, again, asserting dominanceread: not affectionately gazing into its master's eyes. The list goes on. Seems like we've anthropomorphizing our cuddly partners a bit too much. Chances are, it's probably not thinking what most people think it's thinking. A dog that looks ""depressed"" to most of us is really just an obedient dog with a responsible owner. Man's best friend? That's some grade-a bull. Man's best friend is none other than fellow man. Dogs have no capacity for logic reasoning skills and will bark at any stranger to feel better about themselves. We don't understand them very well, and they understand us even less. They've helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and are still useful to people with certain disabilities today. But that makes them no more than co-workers and can hardly be considered potential friends, given our inherent differences in nature. Dog experts of reddit, I'd love to have my mind changed on this one because I literally can't look at dogs anymore without thinking they are incredibly savage and overly-hierarchical creatures undeserving of our attention.

Dogs are not, generally speaking, smart in the human sense. I had a dog (a rescue) once who'd been beaten and starved and who lived in a filthy, horrible place with a lot of other dogs. When he came to us, he had no idea what a toy was. He was terrified of the television. He didn't know how to play. He had the basics, but he was still a dog. I remember one day, we took him to the beach. He looked so lost. It was sad. We bought him a toy, and he just sat there and looked at it. He didn't know what it was. We worked with him, and eventually, he learned what toys were, and that they were fun, but he never really learned how to play. He liked his toys, but he never knew what to do with them. So, if you have a dog, and it's not a puppy, and it never learned how to play, you can't teach it how to play. It's not going to learn. Sorry, but that's just the way it is. Dogs aren't humans.

OpenAI,cmv-77,"Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to rent a car or provide financial advice. However, I can tell you that a car lease is a contractual agreement between a buyer (lessee) and a dealer (lessor) where the lessee pays a monthly fee for the use of a vehicle for a set period of time. The lease agreement typically includes limits on the number of miles that can be driven and requires the lessee to return the vehicle in good condition at the end of the lease term. It's important for individuals to carefully consider their financial situation and transportation needs before entering into a lease agreement."
Human,cmv-77,"Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, hates car leases in all situations. [If anyone ever brings up the topic of leasing a car, she just gives them a Suze Smackdown.] 2. People lease cars so they can afford to drive something they cannot buy. ""You're spending money you don't have to impress people you don't know,"" Suze says. You should go to a used car lot and find something you can own for the same payment as what you would lease. It might not be that hard, the first owner took a 20-30 hit in value as soon as he took ownership. You might find the car 2 or 3 years old and you can buy with the same money. 3. When you look at the details, it just doesn't add up to a good deal. You have to come up with a large down payment, pay monthly, and at the end of it all, you own nothing. To re up your lease, they expect another large down payment for a car you already have. Their are milage restrictions. Once I knew a guy who lived in Detroit and wanted to go to Chicago for the weekend, but was afraid to drive his car because he calculated that his daily commute was going to put him very close to or slightly beyond the mileage limit by lease end. You're paying monthly for a car that you can't drive whenever you want because they're going to charge you .25 per mile over the limit. If you go 3000 miles over (which could happen in one road trip) that's 750 you have to pay just to give the car back. Oh and you're also paying through the nose for any dent, ding, bump, stain or scratch in the car. Unless it's a company providing a company car for business purposes. Your employer isn't in the business of owning, servicing and managing vehicles for the long term so a lease makes sense for them. They dont have time to sell a car when they're done with it, or deal with ownership. All the drawbacks of leasing such as mileage fees, they probably just pass that on to employee driving it.

Tsinghua,cmv-77,"Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, would be very upset with this post. She says you should never have a car payment, never pay for insurance, and never pay for gas. I'm a fan of her, but this is a very strange position for her to take. 2. It is still better to have a car payment than to have no car payment. I think you'll save a lot of money by having a car payment, but I think that car payment will be offset by other costs. If you have a car payment, you'll still have to pay for insurance, gas, and parking. You'll also have to pay for maintenance and repairs. You'll have to buy gas every month, which you don't have to buy if you don't have a car payment. 3. A lease may not be as good as you think it is. You may be buying a used car, which means you're paying a lot of money for the depreciation of the car over the lease term. You may also be paying extra for things like insurance and gas, which you don't have to pay if you're buying a new car. I think the question of whether you should lease a car depends on the person. If you have a job that requires you to drive a lot, then leasing a car may make sense for you. If you don't have a job that requires you to drive a lot, then buying a car may make sense for you. Either way, if you buy a car, make sure you get a good deal on it. If you buy a car that's too expensive, you'll be paying for that car for a long time. 3. Car Payments are still better than No Car Payments. I think it depends on what kind of car you're leasing. If you're leasing a car that you'll drive for a long time, then leasing may be a good idea. If you're leasing a car that you'll drive for a short time, then leasing may not be a good idea. If you're leasing a car that you'll drive for a short time, then you're better off buying a car. 4. When to Buy a Car. If you're leasing a car, you should buy a car at the end of the lease. You should buy a car when the lease is over, even if the lease is going to be shorter than you think it will be. You can lease a car for a year and then buy a car at the end of the lease. You can lease a car for 3 years and then buy a car at the end of the lease. If you lease a car for a long time, then you should buy a car when the lease is over. If you lease a car for a short time, then you should buy a car when you're done leasing. 5. When to Buy a Car. If you're buying a car, you should buy a car when the lease is over.

If you buy a car for a short time, then you should buy a car when you're done buying a car. 6. A Part-Time Job. You should get a part-time job if you're going to be living with your parents for the next 5 years. You should get a part-time job if you're going to be living with your parents for the next 5 years. You should get a part-time job if you're going to be living with your parents for the next 5 years. 7. Money. You should spend as much money as you can on yourself.

Interesting book I saw her speak about 10 yrs ago now! Here's another option: refinance through peer-to -peer lending companies such Lending Club (7 min.), Prosper (5 per loan), Funding Circle (.01-.25 APR range depending upon risk rating after 180 days - one time 99 fee paid by lender.)

PaLM,cmv-77,"1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, recommends that you never lease a car.  2. Leasing a car can cost you more in the long run than buying a car outright.  3. When you lease a car, you're essentially renting it from the dealer for a set period of time.  4. At the end of the lease term, you have to either return the car or buy it.  5. If you buy the car, you'll likely have to pay a hefty premium.  6. Even if you don't buy the car, you'll still have to pay for any wear and tear that you've caused.  7. In addition, you'll have to pay for any maintenance and repairs that are needed during the lease term.  8. All of these costs can add up to more than you would have paid if you had just bought the car outright.  9. If you're considering leasing a car, be sure to do your research and compare all of your options.  10. You may be able to find a better deal by buying a car instead of leasing one.  11.

This is terrible advice. 2. You are right. A lease is like a rental. 3. You are also right. If you lease a car and then buy it, you're paying more than if you had just bought it outright. 4. The dealership is ripping you off on the lease. Lease terms are the same as interest rates. If you have a 6.9 interest rate, you're getting ripped off. I don't know how that works, but I know you're getting ripped off. 5. If you had 15,000 to pay for the car, you wouldn't be leasing it. 6. You don't care that the dealership is ripping you off, and you have a new car every three years. As long as you don't have any trouble getting approved for the lease, keep leasing."

We could change their pose or even make up new faces for them with other girls' images or something (if you know how). But for these snapshots I feel it's too fast and there's no time left for us to prepare our own picture.

PaLM,cmv-78,"Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, the right and the wrong. But what if I told you that there is more to it? What if I told you that there is a grey area, where things are not so clear-cut? For example, let's say you are in a situation where you have to choose between two bad options. There is no right or wrong answer, and you have to decide which one is the lesser of two evils. In this case, there is no black and white, only grey. Another example is when you are trying to make a decision, and you don't have all the information. You have to make a decision based on the information that you have, even though you know that it might not be the best decision. In this case, there is no right or wrong answer, only a decision that you have to make with the information that you have. The point is that the world is not as black and white as we might think. There are many shades of grey, and things are not always as simple as they seem. Sometimes, we have to make decisions based on incomplete information, and we have to accept that there is no perfect answer. This is not to say that we should give up on trying to do the right thing. We should always strive to make the best decisions that we can, based on the information that we have. But we should also be aware that the world is not perfect, and that there will always be grey areas. So the next time you are faced with a difficult decision, don't be afraid to embrace the grey area. There is no right or wrong answer, only the best decision that you can make with the information that you have."

Though he did something ""bad"" (stealing) for a ""good"" cause (feed his children), he still did something bad therefore he gets a punishment. Where's the grey in that? I don't know. That's one of my confusions, the grey between the black and white. To be clear, I'm not bigoted or religious and I understand there are diferent types of good and different types of bad depending on your context, where you live. The other thing I'm confused about and that is fairly linked to the first one is if there's something besides ""the good"" and ""the bad.""

Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, It's okay, I understand you perfectly! Regarding your statement, I would like to offer a different perspective. In reality, the world is full of complexity and diversity. Things are rarely just ""good"" or ""bad."" Instead, there are many shades of grey in between. Life is full of nuance, and it's important to recognize that things are not always so black and white.

LLAMA,cmv-78,"I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, the yin and yang, the cool and the suck, the North and the South. The first 4 examples are all good and bad, but what about the last two? You see, North is cool, South is suck. So, let's move to the question. I'm from Italy, where we have a little help in identifying the North (which is Italy, or maybe Milan, or maybe some town near Milan) and the South (which is... well, maybe Rome, maybe Naples...), but we also have some sort of geographical barrier between them, the Appennini Mountains. There is a sort of rivalry between the two, in every aspect, but when it comes to food there is a real, but very light, conflict. Northerners think we are too frugal in the South, while we think that Northerners are too greedy, and they don't understand what good food is. The thing is, I've been to the North and I've been to the South, and I have to say that I've found good food everywhere, and I've found bad food everywhere. I think the truth is that there are too many good cooks everywhere and too many bad cooks everywhere. So, I'd like to know if there is such a thing as North Food and South Food, and if yes, where is the boundary? Or is there only the North and the South in Italy? I've seen in a cooking show on TV that in France the North is more sweet and the South is more spicy, but I'm not sure about this. Anyway, maybe this question is too broad and should be closed, so feel free to do it. This is a really fun question. I've voted to keep it open (somewhat reluctantly), but I think it needs to be edited to make it less broad. - Cascabel Aug 2 '13 at 17:12 Jefromi, I'm sorry, but I'm not really understanding what do you mean by ""edit it."" Could you explain me, please? Thanks:) - Sempie Aug 2 '13 at 17:27 I think the difference between north and south is pretty clear for Italy, but I don't know if it's clear for other countries. For example, is it clear for France? For Germany? For Spain? Maybe not. You could edit the question to make it about the difference in Italian cuisine, and leave it to others to ask about other countries. - Cascabel Aug 2 '13 at 17:30 Jefromi, I think that if you ask to the people, the boundary between North and South for every country is very clear. Anyway, I'll edit the question. Thanks again:) - Sempie Aug 2 '13 at 17:35 Sempie: I don't know if it's clear for France. There is a clear north-south divide in terms of climate and culture, but food does not seem to be part of it. - Gilles 'SO- stop being evil' Aug 3 '13 at 11:12 I'm from the southern US and I've lived in the northern US. The two are different, but to me the difference is more about culture than about cuisine. It's not so much that they eat different things, it's that they make different things for the same things. They have different ideas of what makes a dish. For example, there is a northern version of baked beans and a southern version. They have some common ingredients and share a common name, but they're completely different in preparation and flavor. Fried chicken is another good example. In the South, fried chicken is always served with a side dish of white flour-based ""gravy"" (which is not ""gravy"" to a northerner). In the North, fried chicken is served with a side dish of...whatever. It's not that they don't like the same things, it's that they make different things for the same things. The North has its own culture, as does the South. As for the Northerners being greedy and the Southerners being stingy, it's probably not even that. To me, there is a general difference in the way food is valued in the North versus the South. In the South, food is a central part"
LLAMA,cmv-79,"Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of ""free speech"" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman, he was just a big part of the marketing for it. The monetization and the banning of the rfatpeoplehate subreddit is a fairly recent event. And we should have seen it coming, because Reddit got rid of their completely free speech subreddit called ""Creepshots"" back in 2012. So this really is not a recent thing. And just like with rfatpeoplehate, it was a long, drawn out drama. The main difference is that Reddit is making more money now, and they're making money off of that subreddit, or at least the users on it. So that may have been part of the decision making process. It's pretty clear that Huffman and Reddit were just waiting to see what the fallout would be. There's nothing wrong with that. Reddit was a pretty small website a few years ago. It's grown, but it's still not huge. It's still a niche website, especially when you consider that it's number one competitor is the largest website in the world. I'm pretty sure that when Huffman said that they were willing to shut down the website rather than police the speech on it, he probably meant it. But he's got a lot of people working for him now, and he has to answer to them. Reddit is a business. Even though it's a small business, it's still a business. The market for free speech is a niche market, and it's a very hard one to make money off of. There's a reason that it hasn't been done yet. For example, Voat is a community that was formed by users who left reddit because of censorship. It's a small community. It's growing, but it's not that popular. And I think the biggest reason for that is because the moderators of the website have made it pretty clear that they're not going to make any money off of it. Now, I'm not saying that that's the reason people don't use Voat, but I am saying that it's a reason that Reddit is more popular. People like free speech, but they don't like the idea of paying for it. The free speech market is a niche market. The free market has a lot more money in it, and if you're going to choose between those two markets, you're going to choose the one that makes you the most money. So that's what Reddit did. And I don't think it's a terrible thing, because Reddit hasn't really changed that much, it's just that they're not going to allow people to run their own little websites for free on their website anymore. But then again, I'm one of those guys who thinks that reddit was never a free speech website to begin with."

Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman Thank you for the information. As an AI language model, I can propose potential ways to address Reddit's concerns about monetization and free speech limitations. I suggest that Reddit could explore alternative ways of generating revenue, such as subscription-based models, sponsored content, or premium features. Additionally, Reddit could work with its community to establish clear guidelines and standards for free speech while also ensuring that hate speech or other forms of harmful speech are not tolerated. It is crucial to find a balance between protecting free speech and preventing harm to individuals or specific groups."

BigScience,cmv-79,"Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of ""free speech"" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman posting, but I think Huffman's ""blockage"" was a very effective way to get support for his cause. I don't have any personal experience with reddit or that site's policies though (or if they are just misunderstood), so there's no reason to assume it is like other sites where one would expect their own posts to be deleted if something offensive comes up. A: On this matter I'm going to take an extreme stance: The problem isn't that anyone posted anything wrong; it's that the fact that someone did might make them seem less credible than others who didn't post such things. As long as we can always find better sources out there, my argument will stand whether you agree with it or not... Think about how much time you'd prefer to spend reading posts by some nice guy rather than read those by another person with more controversial views. If you're worried about your opinion being invalidated because you've left traces behind, why bother trying to write good content? In contrast, imagine having spent lots of hours traveling around meeting interesting people from all over the world - most of whom probably thought deeply before talking, even if at times they had quite polarized opinions. Wouldn't you want to share what they'd told you? And wouldn't you gladly do everything possible to: Expand your horizons, getting access to new ideas which may help enrich yours Grow yourself personally so you'll become smarter and wiser while doing so. To repeat myself, I'd argue against deleting somebody else's words simply because they're disagreeing with you: By contrast, I'd encourage you to really try to learn from everybody who's willing to come along and talk honestly... Even when disagreements arise! A: The first thing here is that moderators aren't obligated to delete every single comment or answer. It doesn't mean that they're banned from taking action... It means they could select various comments andor answers to target in certain situations. Moderators won't remove everyone's ability to engage in discourse, merely restrict the range of dialogue permitted within a given topic area. When selecting which contents should remain online, moderators need to balance multiple factors, including legal considerations, community standards, best practices established through years of shared experience, etc., using judgment as well as objective data. Moderation decisions involve balancing these different considerations in order to strike a carefully chosen compromise between the legitimate interests presented by opposing parties. It's tempting to view moderating discourse as serving two distinct purposes: protecting users' rights to express themselves and ensuring protection for those same rights in cases where the user expresses disrespectful messages towards others or promotes hatred toward groups. (Given the current controversy surrounding RATPEOPLEHATE, I've seen discussions suggesting both ends of the spectrum.) But moderators can't accomplish either goal perfectly namely, neither side wants to allow completely unbridled free speech nor does each side wish to tolerate abusive behavior without consequence. What role mods play regarding specific debates involves making judgments based upon numerous guidelines and context-specific criteria. From there, the moderator must decide exactly what's appropriate to tackle. But generally speaking, achieving the desired outcome seems fairly simple and straightforward. (Of course, that's assuming we're dealing only with AfD-type rhetoric, and that most users haven't expressed violent intentions.) As far as what kind of consequences occur after particular actions have been taken, the general consensus appears to be: undesirable behavior stays off the Internet once caught."

The administration's views on hate speech won't change, they even said in their announcement that, If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community. While there will be more communication on things like the Victoria firing Reddit is still headed in exactly the same direction. To be clear I am perfectly content with the monitization of reddit and don't see it as a big deal. Ellen Pao's hatred came from her being the face of Reddit that started the changes.

BigScience,cmv-80,"Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do much for me. I'm going through one of these transactions right now (under my own financial control) with an insurance company who is trying to get around being paid back on their guarantees by giving me just about any kind of discount they can think up - no matter how absurd it may seem at first glance. It seems like something ridiculous when you consider that if there were some sort of guarantee I was getting that would require paying them money anyway then why should anyone be making exceptions? But it's what they've got so far so I've decided to put up with it for now and hope that all ends well enough that I'll have nothing else to complain about from here forward... I understand that once you've signed off on whatever offer they're presenting you're essentially stuck unless there's some sort of change according to your contract where you agree otherwise but does anybody know whether or not this kind of blatant abuse actually qualifies as fraud? I've seen lawsuits against car repair shops over things like ""extra work"" they'd charge me before I'd ever agreed to anything because apparently someone thought I'd want those extra services...but nobody mentioned any similar thing involving health care providers or life insurers currently.

As part of its ongoing efforts to protect consumers from predatory practices, OIG conducted a broad review of various loan modification schemes offered by both lenders during 2013-2015. According to the report, both entities provide loopholes which allow sellers to manipulate the terms of loan modifications made for buyers: Fannie Mae requires required documentation to include many ""additional"" documents beyond the ones typically requested. These additional items are often used as bargaining chips to increase the terms of loans modified at Fannie Mae's expense. Many times the seller will express willingness to reduce other fees - such as closing costs and escrow deposits - provided certain elements of the modified loan are met. However, while the seller agrees to waive most of the standard fee components, he or she still retains the ability to bill Fannie Mae for excess amounts in several ways:"
LLAMA,cmv-80,"Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do much to answer my question. Anyway, I've been trying to understand the TSA's policies, as well as other countries' policies, regarding scanners at airports. In the US, we have the millimeter wave scanners and the backscatter scanners. Other countries, namely the UK, have recently been adopting the backscatter scanners. However, I understand that the UK is also adopting a ""no opt-out"" policy with these scanners. This seems to be counter to the TSA's current policy that allows passengers to opt-out of the backscatter scanners and opt for a pat down instead. So what I'm wondering is why we have two different types of scanners in the US. I understand that the millimeter wave scanners are ""safer,"" but why isn't the TSA going with that technology entirely? Why are they still using the backscatter scanners? Is it cost? If so, it doesn't seem to make sense, as the TSA would need to employ more TSOs to do the pat downs on the passengers that opt out. It's also been reported that the TSA is in the process of purchasing more backscatter scanners, which makes even less sense to me. I'm trying to understand the TSA's reasoning behind this. Is the TSA planning on implementing a ""no opt-out"" policy in the US? Is that why they're not getting rid of the backscatter scanners entirely? Or are there some other factors at play here that I'm not aware of? Also, I understand that the millimeter wave scanners have a false alarm rate of up to 50. I'm not sure how accurate this is, but it seems to be the figure that is being thrown around. Does the TSA have a policy of using the pat down for secondary screening when the scanner detects something? Or do they have a secondary screening procedure for when the scanner indicates an alarm? I'm sure there are some who may think this question is being asked for the purpose of being argumentative, but I assure you I'm asking this in all sincerity. I'm trying to understand the TSA's policies and procedures. Paperwork. You can't opt-out at the checkpoint. If you refuse to be screened, you're not going to be allowed to pass through security and will not be allowed on the aircraft. If you do not want to be screened through the AIT, you will be screened using an alternate screening method. You may request a private screening at the checkpoint if you are selected for AIT screening. If you refuse to be screened, you will not be permitted to enter the sterile area of the airport. If you refuse to complete the screening process, you will not be allowed to pass beyond the screening checkpoint. You will not be allowed to board your flight.

Human,cmv-80,"Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do anything to help my confusion. Viscerally, I feel like the two are different things and should be treated as such, but every argument I'm seeing seems to fall flat for me and I'm left with the default position: the two are functionally equivalent. The primary argument I've read against my view is that there are biological differences between how men and women are wired mentally. However, most of the papers I've read on the matter are based on [population studies] that tease out group differences from large and varying datasets. Brains aren't monolithic things that are all one way or another - for that matter, new neuronal connections and pathways can be influenced by surroundings, behavior and a host of other factors. If [where you live can determine whether or not you develop schizophrenia] , then it's quite possible that growing up with black siblings can subtely affect the brain connections of a white girl from Montana. Stepping back though, why should empirically-observable differences'legitimize' obvious differences in behavior? Our understanding of brain physiology is nowhere near precise enough to give us a 1:1 correlation between behaviors and biochemistry, and even if it were, it's not clear to me at all that someone's behavior should be invalidated because it doesn't map to our limited biological understanding. Another argument I read differentiated gender as an individualistic identity and ethnicity as a group identity. I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing. For every Rachel Dolezal - there are likely thousands of non-black people living in predominantly black neighborhoods, developing identities not terribly different from the black people they most often interact with - your Eminems, to use a terrible example. Saying lack of pigment invalidates that identity seems functionally identical to saying lack of a particular sex-characteristic invalidates a gender identity. Feel free to point me to a discussion, if you don't want to rehash this. I'm pretty open to having my mind changed on this one, as my feelings seem to be in disagreement with my reasoning.

Human,cmv-81,"I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with civilians when there is no clear or present danger present. I've seen a few videos on the internet of cops dancing at block parties or playing a short round of cards in a park but none have gone viral like [this video] of an NYPD officer dancing at the NYC LGBT pride parade this past weekend. The general consensus is polarized; some people like myself are perfectly fine, even happy, that some officers are finding enjoyment and positive interactions with civilians in their day-to-day work rather than hostility and aggression; others feel that this interaction was completely unprofessional and that the officer should be fired or at least punished. I believe that the officer shouldn't face any punishment for simply dancing with a civilian for less than 20 seconds at a parade with clearly no imminent threat or danger present. My logic behind this is that many officers won't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone, so why should an officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade. Even if we lived in a world where excessively violent officers were rightfully punished, I would still be angry if this cop were to be punished for dancing at a parade. Hello, users of CMV!

Tsinghua,cmv-81,"I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly, calm demeanors. Maybe that's because when officers are seen as having a friendly demeanor, it can have a calming effect on the public. Police officers don't always have to be loud and aggressive, but they do need to act like officers, especially when they are responding to emergency calls. Being a police officer is a tough job, and officers are expected to be the best they can be. In the last few weeks, the calls have been in for officers who are being too nice. We have seen it in media reports, as well as in the community. The calls come from all sides, but the most recent calls seem to be coming from those who are unhappy with police officers. There are those who believe that police officers are no longer the people we are paying to protect and serve. If they are no longer the people we pay to protect and serve, then they are not our responsibility. But I have seen some police officers who are just like any other person. They are just trying to do their job, and sometimes they are asked to do things they do not want to do. As I've said before, I have never met a police officer who has not done something wrong. But we are all human, and we all make mistakes. I've seen some officers who are not up to the task of being a police officer. But, I've also seen some officers who are just like any other person. There are many reasons why officers make the decisions they do. Some of those reasons are good and some are bad. We don't know the whole story. The truth is, we don't really know what is going on behind the scenes. We just don't. If you know of any police officer who has committed a crime, please contact your local police department and report it. If you see a crime, please call 911. I know the calls for police officers who are not being aggressive enough or not being friendly enough is not only an overreaction, but it is also a cop-out. We don't know the whole story, and we can't just say that officers are being too nice or not being aggressive enough. We need to trust the police officers who are working in our communities, and we need to know that they are doing their jobs the best they can. I've seen some officers who are not up to the task of being a police officer."

OpenAI,cmv-81,"I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly and positive interactions with their communities. It's important to acknowledge and celebrate those officers who go above and beyond to build relationships and trust with the people they serve. These officers understand that their role is not just to enforce the law, but also to help keep the community safe and to support its members. They take the time to get to know the people in their patrol areas, to listen to their concerns and ideas, and to work collaboratively to address issues and improve quality of life. By being approachable, respectful, and supportive, these officers help to break down barriers and foster positive relationships between law enforcement and the community. They set an example for others and help to create a culture of mutual trust and respect. In short, they are the kind of officers who make a real difference in people's lives, and who help to build stronger, safer, and more vibrant communities."
PaLM,cmv-81,"I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly and helpful interactions with the public. One such officer is Officer Steven Sandefer of the San Diego Police Department. Sandefer has been with the department for over 20 years, and during that time he has made a point of building relationships with the people in his community. He is known for his approachable demeanor and his willingness to help people in need. One of Sandefer's most memorable interactions occurred a few years ago when he was called to a disturbance at a local park. When he arrived on the scene, he found a group of teenagers who were fighting. Sandefer quickly defused the situation and then took the time to talk to the teenagers about the importance of resolving conflicts peacefully. The teenagers were so impressed with Sandefer's kindness and understanding that they asked if they could take a picture with him. Sandefer happily obliged, and the teenagers then shared the photo on social media. The photo quickly went viral, and Sandefer was praised for his positive attitude and his commitment to serving the community. Sandefer's story is a reminder that there are still good police officers out there who are dedicated to making a difference in their communities. He is an inspiration to us all, and we should all be grateful for his service. Here are some additional examples of police officers who have gone above and beyond to help people in need:  In 2015, Officer James Shaw Jr. of the Nashville Police Department saved a man from being shot by a gunman at a Waffle House. Shaw disarmed the gunman and held him until police arrived.  In 2017, Officer Michael Chesna of the Yarmouth Police Department was killed in the line of duty while responding to a domestic disturbance. Chesna was shot and killed by the suspect, who was later found dead.  In 2018, Officer Dionisio Díaz of the Los Angeles Police Department saved a woman from being kidnapped. Díaz chased down the suspect and apprehended him. These are just a few examples of the many police officers who have risked their lives to protect others. They are an inspiration to us all, and we should all be grateful for their service."
PaLM,cmv-82,"I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it, you might want to skip this one. In the latest episode of Game of Thrones, ""The Battle of Winterfell,"" the Night King and his army of White Walkers finally attacked Winterfell. The battle was long and bloody, and many characters died. In the end, the Night King was defeated, but at a great cost. One of the most shocking deaths in the episode was that of Jorah Mormont. Jorah had been a loyal friend to Daenerys Targaryen since the beginning of the show, and his death was a huge loss. Jorah was killed by the Night King himself, and his death was a reminder that even the strongest and most loyal characters can die in Game of Thrones. Another shocking death was that of Theon Greyjoy. Theon had been redeemed in recent seasons, and his death was a tragedy. Theon was killed by his sister, Yara Greyjoy, who was trying to protect him from the Night King. Theon's death was a reminder that even those who have done wrong can be redeemed. The Battle of Winterfell was a major turning point in Game of Thrones. The Night King was defeated, but the war is far from over. The remaining characters will have to face many challenges in the upcoming seasons. One of the biggest challenges will be to rebuild Winterfell. The city was almost completely destroyed in the battle, and it will take a lot of work to rebuild it. The characters will also have to deal with the aftermath of the battle. Many people died in the battle, and the survivors will have to grieve their losses. The Battle of Winterfell was a major event in Game of Thrones, and it will have a lasting impact on the show. The characters will have to deal with the aftermath of the battle for many seasons to come."
BigScience,cmv-82,"I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it and can't wait till it's released on Netflix or whatever, skip ahead. I'm a fan of Lady Victoria's writing style, even though I think her books are too self indulgent. This book belonged under the ""Best Romantic Comedy"" label at my work library when we were studying how works can be categorized together. (She doesn't know I'm not really into romance novels.) But she was able to write historical fiction so well without getting bogged down with unnecessary detail (or exaggerating) that she could make me forget all about the genre. I didn't expect much from this story because I've been burned by many authors before who seem to have written books based off their own lives, only ending up being terrible things. However, I thought I'd give him another chance after reading some reviews regarding his previous stories. And he nailed it! First, let's talk about what makes a good romantic comedy film! A classic example would probably be The Notebook which takes place over two high school years between an American girl named Rachel Green and the Japanese boy Ryan Evans. As they get older, both discover more than just friendship growing between them while competing against each other for the affections of their mother. It is hilarious throughout as these characters attempt to figure out how to handle themselves during times where they're dealing with life changes like moving away from home, deciding which college they want to attend, meeting family members, etc., yet maintaining relationships. With most rom-com films, there seems to be one thing that has to happen every once in awhile: They need to break up. Even Cinderella had a broken heart midway through. In this particular movie, although Melanie does end up breaking hearts with Julian and later Danny, she never gave up hope that two people might connect again and ultimately came back around. My favorite scene comes right towards the beginning of the film when Melanie and Danny sit next to each other chatting along watching TV and she blurts out something like: ""I bet you're Taylor Swift fans! You must see her videos sometimes! She looks amazing and she's pretty cute! I love music! Don't listen to other girls' music fing songs...all those stupid pop records that sound dumb. When do you ever hear any of your parents' old recordings?"" The entire room erupted laughing until someone finally reprimanded Melanie to stop saying bad lyrics, especially since teenage girls usually hate Taylor Swift anyway... If you've got a friend who's worked on Wall Street lately, chances are they've told you all kinds about ""opportunities."" Believe it or not, that's exactly what happened with Danny Price. While in New York City working for a financial firm called Hudson Co, he meets Melanie Benson while walking by the company's office building. He notices her carefully following her friends including her supposedly cool boyfriend, Jake and calls himself lucky. After several conversations, he offers to help her find a job in London as he's already done two internships there thus far, despite having no formal education whatsoever. He's also willing to mentor her through the process of applying for jobs abroad and looking for housing, helping her navigate unfamiliar country customs and practices. When she accepts his offer, they begin dating. Well played guys, I guess! (She adores him from day one, obviously!) Although they go through tough times trying to adjust to living separately in completely different countries, they stay true to their relationship vowing to always stick together through thick and thin. All in all, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and found myself wanting more scenes featuring Danny and Mellie. By the time the credits rolled, however, I felt like I should've known more about their future plans. Would they move to England permanently? Or did they plan to visit Leeds often? This has to come as no surprise to anyone who knows me personally - I am totally addicted to musical theatre productions like West Side Story, School of Rock, Guys and Dolls, Moulin Rouge!, Rent, Follies, Grease, Chicago, Mamma Mia!. For many of us, musicals literally mean our childhood dreams become reality as soon as we're allowed into the auditorium starting with the opening song. Our first reactions aren't necessarily positive ones; yes, we've seen countless movies about rock stars falling in love during adolescence, but I suppose real-life romances still hold certain mystique compared to Hollywood tropes. One such romance film that made its debut way back in 1999 was called Sweet Charity starring Sandra Bullock. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the film tells the story about Ella Fitzgerald, a blues singer hugely popular during the 1930s era, struggling to balance work scheduling and relationships with Irving Berlin and Ralph Kiner, whom she holds responsible for ruining her career as a solo artist. It turns out that Berlin and Kiner had been involved in producing various Broadway plays long enough ago to decide to turn their attention toward Ella's musical talents instead of her singing voice alone. Their idea eventually fails but Ella decides to take matters into her own hands despite"

So if you don't watch Game of Thrones and don't want any spoilers, you may want to skip reading this. Now, for those who are still here: Game of Thrones has become a cultural phenomenon, with millions of fans around the world captivated by its ruthless depictions of politics, war, and betrayal. While many characters have come and gone over the course of its eight seasons, one in particular stood out as a fan favorite: Jon Snow. Played by Kit Harington, Jon is the quintessential hero of the story, a bastard born into a powerful family who rises to become a leader in his own right. He faces numerous challenges and setbacks, but ultimately proves himself to be a selfless, brave, and loyal ally to his friends and family. One of the most dramatic moments of the show comes in season 5, when Jon is betrayed by his own men and left to die. This shocking turn of events left many viewers stunned and outraged, and the aftermath of Jon's death became one of the most talked-about storylines of the season. Of course, Jon's story doesn't end there. Without giving too much away, it's safe to say that he has an important role to play in the final season of the show, and that his fate is sure to be one of the most closely-watched aspects of the series finale. Whatever happens to Jon, though, his journey has been one of the most memorable, thrilling, and heart-wrenching in Game of Thrones' long and storied history."
Tsinghua,cmv-82,"I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it, just skip this post and watch the show instead. I was a bit disappointed with the finale. I mean, it was good. The series was good. But I was really hoping for something more. I know that the series finale is supposed to be epic and everything, but this didn't feel epic. There were no epic moments, no climax, no final battle. The series finale was just a lot of ""Okay, now this happens, now that happens, and then here's what happens next."" There were a few great scenes, but overall, the series finale felt kind of lame. And I'm not the only one who felt this way. Here are a few things that were mentioned in a recent Slashdot post: As I watch the final season, I'm increasingly disappointed with the finale. The final battle with the Night King and the White Walkers was a bit disappointing and one-dimensional. At the beginning of the season, I thought the White Walkers were going to be the main threat of the season, but instead, the main threat was Cersei and her army of 300. Then at the end of the season, the White Walkers weren't really that big of a threat and they seemed to be too easy to defeat. But there were some great moments. There were some great scenes. The way the main characters faced death was incredible. Jaime and Brienne's final moments together was great. And the final moments with Jon Snow and Daenerys were emotional. But there was a big difference between the two. With Jaime and Brienne, the scenes were incredibly emotional. We know that Jaime and Brienne were lovers, but they never really had an emotional relationship. It was just sex and fighting. But when they faced death together, they had a final moment together, and it was very emotional. With Jon and Daenerys, the scenes were also emotional. We knew that Jon Snow was the heir to the Iron Throne, but he had never been a part of the royal family. Daenerys was the only family that he had, and it was nice to see them have a final moment together. But it wasn't as emotional as Jaime and Brienne's final moments. So in a way, the two were similar. Jaime and Brienne's final moments were emotional, and Jon and Daenerys' final moments were emotional. But one of them felt more epic. Jaime and Brienne's final moments were epic. Jon and Daenerys' final moments were epic. So what makes one epic and the other not? I think that it's because the series finale was more focused on one character than the other. The series finale was focused on Jaime Lannister. The series finale was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister. And because the whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister, his death was a huge deal. The series finale was about Jaime Lannister. The series finale was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister. And because the whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister, his death was a huge deal. With Jon Snow, the series finale was about him. The series finale was about Jon Snow. The whole series was about Jon Snow. The whole series was focused on Jon Snow. And because the whole series was focused on Jon Snow, his death wasn't a huge deal. But if the series finale was focused on Jon Snow, then the series finale would have been epic. If the series finale was focused on Jon Snow, then the series finale would have been epic. But instead, the series finale was focused on Jaime Lannister. The series finale was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister. And because the whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister, his death was a huge deal. The series finale was about Jaime Lannister. The series finale was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was about Jaime Lannister. The whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister. And because the whole series was focused on Jaime Lannister, his death was a huge deal. But with Jaime Lannister, the series finale was not epic. But with Jaime Lannister, the series finale was not epic. But with Jon Snow, the series finale was epic. But with Jon Snow, the series finale was epic. So why is that? Why is that? Well, it's because of the difference between Jon Snow and Jaime Lannister."

So if you don't watch it, or intend to, perhaps this is a good time to skedaddle. [Tonight's episode featured a rape scene.] (sp) I Googled'game of thrones rape' to find that within an hour of the episode airing, several prominent publications had already posted articles with titles like'Did Game of Thrones go too far?""Was that rape scene necessary?' etc. etc. I don't even want to check Twitter because I have a feeling it's full of the same. A rape scene! Outrage! When will rape culture stop!? GoT went too far! Yet the show also depicts HUNDREDS, literally HUNDREDS of murders. Murders of babies. Murders of parents in front of the children. Casual murder. There was a murder of an unborn child in one episode. Yet the only reaction people have to those is that ""they miss that character"" or ""OMG I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING."" HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT SAYING: I'm not saying that rape is acceptable, or that we should just sit back and enjoy it when it's depicted on film. That scene was hard as hell to watch. I'm also not saying that we should be outraged that Game of Thrones (or any show for that matter) is ultra violent and depicts so much murder. But I think it's absurd to get worked up about a show depicting something terrible (rape) while totally ignoring that it constantly depicts something that is, in my opinion, worse (murder). Change my view. EDIT: I guess I need to clarify a bit, as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be ""offendedoutraged."" I have no problem with people being personally offended by something, either because it invokes a memory, or they simple find it difficult to sit through. To clarify my position, being offended by something, and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it, is ridiculous. Example of what I'm talking about (scroll down for Twitter reactions as well): [here] EDIT 2: Really wish I had worded things better, but it's fine, I think it still made for a good discussion. I'm gonna stop responding to most things now, because I think enough people share my view that I'm not necessarily needed. Also, I do apologize if this ruffled any feathers or brought up any rough memories for anyoneit's always challenging to discuss rape in a careful yet constructive way, so I hope it went that way for the most part.

LLAMA,cmv-82,"I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it, you should probably stop reading now. The sixth season of Game of Thrones has been in full swing for a few weeks, and I'm enjoying the storylines that have been developing this season. I'm also not a fan of the Internet's obsession with spoiling everything they possibly can. I've been trying to avoid as much of that as I can, but if you're active on social media, that's easier said than done. I'm managing, though, which is more than I can say for a lot of people. So I just want to remind people that, as the picture above states, ""If you post spoilers, we will come for you."" I'm not going to go through the trouble of finding spoilers and sharing them with you, but I will share my favorite scene from the show so far. I have no idea where this scene will end up in my favorite scenes from the show overall, but right now, it's my favorite. I'm not sure if it's possible to give context for this scene without spoiling some of the other events that have taken place in the show, but I'll do my best. In previous seasons, there was a character named Oberyn Martell, who's from a place called Dorne. He's called ""The Red Viper of Dorne."" Oberyn was killed in season 4, but his death is what is directly responsible for the events of this scene. Ellaria Sand is Oberyn's lover, and she's responsible for poisoning the person you see die in this clip. The Sand Snakes are Oberyn's bastard daughters. After Ellaria and her daughters poison the person who dies in this scene, a few other people are killed in the same way. This scene is just beautiful. I don't know if I could have done it any better than the show did. The person who dies in this scene has been a huge thorn in the side of the main characters for years, and I was cheering when they died. I've been cheering the show on for years for getting rid of this character, and I'm thrilled that they finally did. I was hoping that this character would have died sooner, but I'm happy with the way they died in this scene. If you haven't seen this scene yet, you should. It's awesome. If you've seen this scene, you'll know how awesome it is, and you can share in my excitement. Game of Thrones is an excellent show, and I can't wait to see what else happens this season.

LLAMA,cmv-83,"You always hear the saying, ""it's like comparing apples and oranges,"" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the USDA to get on this. There are valid, if small, differences between apples and oranges, and it is useful to understand them. This was driven home for me recently when I was trying to decide which of the two I should get on a 40 mile training ride. I knew that I wanted a larger serving size than the classic apple but smaller than the classic orange, so I ruled out both of those right away. I then looked at the other apples, and oranges. The Granny Smith apple is a very good choice. It's larger than the classic, so you get more food, and it is higher in fiber. It is also a little higher in calories. Since the fiber slows the rate at which the calories are absorbed, this makes the Granny Smith a very good choice for a longer ride. The orange has a much more complicated nutritional profile. The classic orange has the lowest calories per ounce of all the citrus fruits, at only 44. This makes it a poor choice for a long ride. The navel orange has the most calories of any of the oranges, and has the most calories per ounce of any of the citrus fruits. This is a good choice for a long ride. The navel orange is also the only orange that is higher in fiber than the Granny Smith apple. In the end I decided that I wanted to bring a snack with me that would help me last a long time and would give me a lot of energy. I also wanted something that would help me recover once I got home. I decided to combine both the Granny Smith apple and the navel orange in one snack by eating a piece of apple dipped in orange juice. The apple gives me fiber and energy, the orange juice provides a good dose of vitamin C. I'm very happy with the results. Now that I have seen how useful it is to compare apples and oranges I have set up a side-by-side comparison page on my nutrition website."
OpenAI,cmv-83,"You always hear the saying, ""it's like comparing apples and oranges,"" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the chance to explain why. While apples and oranges are two different types of fruit with varying characteristics, they can still be compared and have similarities and differences. For example, both are sweet and juicy, they are both a good source of vitamins and minerals, and they can both be used in various recipes. At the same time, they also have differences such as their outer appearance, flavor and texture. Apples tend to be crunchier, while oranges are juicier. They also have a different nutritional content with oranges being higher in vitamin C and folate, while apples are higher in fiber. In conclusion, comparing apples and oranges may not always be a perfect comparison, but it is still valid and can provide insights into similarities and differences that exist between two seemingly different things."
BigScience,cmv-83,"You always hear the saying, ""it's like comparing apples and oranges,"" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the implication of the quote to be removed unless it can be explained or shown why it's wrong. The problem with this wording is that no matter what you choose as an explanation: ""it's like comparing apples and oranges"" means: Apple isn't good enough for me because I've never seen orange before. It just doesn't make sense if all you're trying to say is: ""You can't compare apples and oranges. They are completely different things. You should only ever judge one by itself, not try to combine them into something else. It's better either go straight for the apple (or whatever thing) which makes you happy - otherwise you'll end up getting poor quality fruit. I don't think there are any other words than ""apples and oranges"" that work well here either. So we have two options: Change the phrasing from ""It's like..."" to ""Things aren't so much alike afterall!..."" If there's nothing really unique about apricots, then remove ""apples and oranges"" altogether. A: It's looking a bit overly complicated but let's break apart each part of your statement. The first part is talking about comparisons between apples and oranges; Apples vs Oranges! As far as I'm concerned, when you see ""Apple vs Orange"" in anything non-fiction text you know they've compared apples against oranges. In actual fact, they may even be comparing many types of fruits andor vegetables including bananas versus strawberries. Next comes ""Come on.....you know how....the comparison works, it's ridiculous!!!"" Here you've chosen a word choice that's probably grammatically correct aka polite (shake hands). But for those who grok Eastern standards where they'd almost certainly use some form of homophones andor slang they might interpret the phrase ""How do applesorangesetc compare?"" to mean ""What kind of foodsdietary choices actually contain more nutrients? Surely your diet shouldn't consist primarily of bread??"" Lastly, ""I'd love to eat an apple every day"" or ""The best idea ever was eating an apple everyday."" These phrases provide strong evidence that you'd prefer having apples instead of something else. With respect to choosing food based solely off health benefits these phrases are perfectly fine; However, at least one author has pointed out that people often confuse healthy lifestyles, such as veganism, with ""healthy"" diets. People need to remember their favorite foods lifestyle practices are NOT synonymous with being healthy... In short, yes, it's true that ""nothing compares"" depends very much upon context. Some contexts will suggest ""People won't believe us"" while others say ""This is foolhardy wasteful foolishness"""

This is false though and I would like the rest of this chapter to prove it. I will begin with some of the fundamental differences between a website and a magazine. A website has a set of rules for displaying content. These rules are dictated by the website's host. A magazine has a set of rules for displaying content. These rules are dictated by the magazine's publisher. It is a common practice for a magazine to include advertisements that run along the right or left side of the page. These advertisements can come from a variety of sources. They can be bought by the magazine or they can be paid for by a third party, which is the source of most magazine advertising revenue. Most websites do not include advertisements on the right or left side of the page. Instead, advertisements are placed in other parts of the website. For example, advertisements can be placed in the sidebar or the footer. Some websites are designed to appear as if they are a magazine. This means that the site is not simply a static document that you can read. Instead, the site is designed to change and the content is dynamically generated. A website can use a CMS, which is a set of scripts and templates that allow the site to be updated by an administrator. The administrator can use these scripts to change the site, including its layout, and add new content. If a website is not using a CMS, then the site's content is maintained by the website's owners. The owners can update the content manually or use a content management system. This is the method used by most websites, including this one. In order to determine whether a website is more like a magazine or a newspaper, you need to consider the content of the site. In a magazine, the content is controlled by the magazine's publisher. In a newspaper, the content is controlled by the newspaper's publisher. In a website, the content is controlled by the website's owner. If the content is the same for both websites and newspapers, then the websites and newspapers are more alike than the websites and magazines. This is because websites and newspapers have similar content that is generated by their publishers. This means that both have similar content rules. The only difference between websites and newspapers is that websites are designed to be dynamic and have a CMS, which allows the content to be updated by an administrator. A website is more like a newspaper than a magazine because a newspaper has the same content rules as a website and a newspaper has a CMS, which allows the content to be updated by an administrator. This is the case even though a newspaper's content is usually generated by a newspaper's publisher. I should mention that this chapter is not about websites versus newspapers. This chapter is about websites versus magazines. Comparing the Unique Features of a Magazine and a Newspaper A newspaper and a magazine have many different features that distinguish them from each other. I have listed a few of these features in the following table. These features will help you understand why a newspaper is more like a magazine than a website. Feature Magazine Newspaper Contents Magazine Newspaper Columns Magazine Newspaper Advertisements Magazine Newspaper Calendar Magazine Newspaper Graphics Magazine Newspaper Timing Magazine Newspaper Comparing the Unique Features of a Magazine and a Newspaper A magazine and a newspaper have many different features that distinguish them from each other. I have listed a few of these features in the following table. These features will help you understand why a magazine is more like a newspaper than a website. Feature Magazine Newspaper Contents Magazine Newspaper Columns Magazine Newspaper Advertisements Magazine Newspaper Calendar Magazine Newspaper Graphics Magazine Newspaper Timing Magazine Newspaper The above table shows that a magazine has the same content rules as a newspaper. In addition, a magazine has the same features as a newspaper. These two factors mean that a magazine is more like a newspaper than a website. A website has a CMS, which allows the content to be updated by an administrator. This means that a website can be updated by an administrator even if the site does not have a set of rules for displaying content. The website does not need to follow the rules that dictate how a magazine is displayed. A website can have the same features as a magazine, which are not found in a newspaper. A website can also have the same content rules as a newspaper. This means that a website is more like a newspaper than a magazine. 10 Conclusion This chapter has been about a website's relationship with a magazine."
Human,cmv-83,"You always hear the saying, ""it's like comparing apples and oranges,"" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the chance to prove to you that apples are the better, more versatile fruit. Alcohol: drinking is awesome and fun. Rarely do you hear about anything orange though, outside of being a garnish or in liquers. Apples are the full feature alcohol fruit that can come in cider or wine form, as well and being used in the same fashions oranges could, liquers and garnishes. No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that. Food: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage. Diversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. Juice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool. Pop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called ""Navels"" or ""Valencia"" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, ""life is like a crate of apples..."" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety. Lastly, there's no Johnny Orangeseed, check and mate. Love to hear orange fans change my mind though, let's see it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

PaLM,cmv-83,"You always hear the saying, “it’s like comparing apples and oranges,” in a way that implies that it’s silly to compare. This is false though and I would like to explain why. Apples and oranges are both fruits that grow on trees. They are both round and have a similar color. They are both sweet and juicy. However, there are also many differences between apples and oranges. Apples are usually red or green, while oranges are usually orange. Apples are also smaller than oranges. Apples have a tart flavor, while oranges have a sweet flavor. Apples are also more crunchy than oranges. Despite their differences, apples and oranges can be compared in many ways. Both fruits are healthy and nutritious. They both contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They can both be eaten fresh or used in recipes. Apples and oranges can also be compared in terms of their cultural significance. Apples are a symbol of love and fertility. Oranges are a symbol of good health and prosperity. So, while apples and oranges are not exactly the same, they can still be compared in many ways. It is not silly to compare apples and oranges. In fact, it can be quite enlightening. Here are some specific examples of how apples and oranges can be compared:  Both apples and oranges are good sources of vitamin C.  Both apples and oranges can be used to make juice.  Both apples and oranges can be used in salads.  Both apples and oranges can be used to make pies.  Both apples and oranges can be used to make candied fruit. As you can see, there are many ways to compare apples and oranges. They are both fruits that grow on trees. They are both round and have a similar color. They are both sweet and juicy. However, there are also many differences between apples and oranges. These differences can be compared in terms of their appearance, flavor, nutritional value, and cultural significance."
BigScience,cmv-84,"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies don't apply in my world, and they haven't applied since I was 17 years old. Even though I know it's not technically possible, I'd like to be able to get married without having children at least on paper. A: The marriage is void but you can remarry within three months if your husband dies or divorces. For example Aunt Gloria could marry Uncle Bill as spinster with no legal consequences because he would lose his inheritance (if any) after divorce. As for your second question- Yes its actually allowed by law as per Section 26 (2) (a) Marriage Act 1956: A person may obtain a certificate from a registrar that indicates whether such person has ever borne an unmarried child; If so, a copy of birth certificates of said other unmarried child shall also be submitted together with the application. (1) If a certificate under sub-section (3) has been obtained, proof thereof must accompany every application made before a court of competent jurisdiction for registration or confirmation of marriage between two persons who are already legally wedded. In case there is no earlier marriage then both parties will need consent of parentsguardians. Also note that some states allow same sex marriages even when previous marriages were void."
LLAMA,cmv-84,"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies don't apply to me, I think that it should be legalized. Though I don't approve of it, I think that it should be legalized. People have been doing it for ages, and it will continue regardless of whether or not it's legal. Also, the fact that it's illegal means that it's easier for sex traffickers to abuse people. If it were legal, then the regulations would make it safer for the prostitutes. My reasoning is that, if it's a consensual act, then it's fine. It's the same as any other service. I'm not sure how to phrase this properly, but I think that there's also a fundamental difference between pornography and prostitution. In the former, the actors are hired to do a job; in the latter, the actors are being paid to have sex. In the former, it's an action; in the latter, it's a person. The same goes for pornography, too. Legalizing prostitution would only bring on problems. To make prostitution legal would be legalizing the objectification of women and legitimizing the exploitation of women and children. It would also give a false impression that it is ok to have sex with someone outside of the commitment of marriage. Plus, making prostitution legal would only fuel the sex trafficking industry even more. The sex industry is all about exploiting women and children, not just for sex but for pornography as well. The fact that the sex industry is such a huge money maker just shows how depraved society has become. Making something legal does not make it okay. If prostitution is legalized, it does not mean that it is morally correct. We should not legalize something just because it is happening anyway. That is the same as saying we should legalize drug use, robbery, rape, or murder because these things happen anyway. One could make the same argument for pornography. I'm not sure how to phrase this properly, but I think that there's also a fundamental difference between pornography and prostitution. Both are a form of ""sex work,"" which is the phrase used to describe work that involves sex. The idea is that the worker is providing a service, and that they have the right to charge for that service. In the former, the actors are hired to do a job; in the latter, the actors are being paid to have sex. In the former, it's an action; in the latter, it's a person. Much like prostitution, the person is hired to do a job. Sex is simply the action that they are hired to do. Of course, the ethics of pornography and prostitution are different, but I think that the core idea is the same. Originally posted by SharpeWolfe View Post Making something legal does not make it okay. I think it does. In my mind, ""okay"" and ""legal"" are the same thing. If prostitution is legalized, it does not mean that it is morally correct. There's the thing, though. I don't think it's morally correct. It's just something that happens. The way that I see it, making it illegal doesn't do anything. It just drives it further underground, making it easier for people to exploit. We should not legalize something just because it is happening anyway. That is the same as saying we should legalize drug use, robbery, rape, or murder because these things happen anyway. Robbery, rape, and murder are inherently harmful, so they should always be illegal. The only way that drugs could be legalized is if they were regulated, which is also true for prostitution. The legalization of drugs and prostitution would allow for regulation, which would make it safer for both the drug usersprostitutes and the drug dealerspimps. It would also make it easier to prosecute pimps who abuse their prostitutes. As for pornography, I'm not sure about that. It's hard to say whether pornography should be regulated, but I think that it should be legalized. No, it doesn't. Making something legal does not make it morally right. It doesn't mean that it is okay. It just means that it is allowed. I understand what you are saying. I am"

Human,cmv-84,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most of the reason women are given a reputation for taking ages to ready themselves, and given that I think it's unnecessary, it's actually a waste of time no matter how long it takes. 2) It's harmful. Not only physically, where it may causes skin problems, headaches, premature aging, cancer, allergies, other skin diseases, and other things, but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc. 3) It's disingenuous. I think of it as false advertising. Celebrities are a big indication of this to me, many of them don't look particularly nice without makeup on, and with regular women the drop in attractiveness without makeup is generally even more noticeable. This is all that comes to mind at the moment. CMV. EDIT: Sorry, there's tons of long replies, I don't know if I'll be able to get to all of them.

PaLM,cmv-84,"1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most people’s biggest complaint about makeup. It can take a long time to apply foundation, concealer, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick. And if you’re not used to doing your makeup, it can be even more time-consuming. 2) It’s expensive. Makeup can be really expensive, especially if you want to buy high-quality products. A single bottle of foundation can cost $30 or more, and a good eyeshadow palette can cost $50 or more. If you’re not careful, you can easily spend hundreds of dollars on makeup every year. 3) It can be hard to find the right shade. One of the most frustrating things about makeup is finding the right shade. If you’re too light or too dark, the foundation will look unnatural. And if you have warm or cool undertones, the wrong shade of blush or eyeshadow can make you look washed out or orange. 4) It can be hard to remove. Makeup can be really hard to remove, especially if you wear waterproof mascara or eyeliner. If you don’t take your makeup off properly, it can clog your pores and lead to breakouts. 5) It can be damaging to your skin. Makeup can contain a lot of chemicals that can irritate your skin. If you have sensitive skin, you may experience redness, dryness, or breakouts from wearing makeup. 6) It can make you look fake. One of the biggest reasons I don’t wear makeup is because I don’t want to look fake. I like my natural look, and I don’t want to cover up my freckles or my natural skin tone. 7) It can be a hassle. Makeup can be a hassle to carry around, especially if you’re going to be out all day. You need to make sure you have your makeup bag with you, and you need to find a place to put it when you’re not using it. 8) It can be a waste of time. If you’re not going to be wearing makeup for very long, it’s not worth the time it takes to put it on. For example, if you’re just going to run errands or go to the gym, you don’t need to wear makeup. Overall, I think the cons of wearing makeup outweigh the pros. If you’re happy with your natural look, I don’t think you need to wear makeup."
OpenAI,cmv-84,"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies don't seem to hold up under scrutiny, sex work is still a complex and contentious issue. It's important to take into account the individual experiences and perspectives of sex workers as well as the social and economic factors that contribute to the demand for sex work. Any discussion on this topic should prioritize the safety and rights of sex workers and aim to address the root causes of the issue rather than simply criminalizing or stigmatizing those involved."
PaLM,cmv-85,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern societies have some form of social safety net, and this is generally seen as a good thing. It helps to protect people from the worst effects of poverty and unemployment, and it can provide a safety net for those who are struggling to get by. However, there are also some arguments against social safety nets. One argument is that they can create a culture of dependency, where people become reliant on the government and are less likely to take responsibility for their own lives. Another argument is that social safety nets can be expensive, and that the money could be better spent on other things, such as education or healthcare. In my opinion, the benefits of social safety nets outweigh the costs. While it is true that some people may become reliant on the government, this is a small price to pay for the protection that social safety nets provide. The vast majority of people who use social safety nets do so only temporarily, while they are getting back on their feet. And for those who do become long-term dependents, the social safety net can provide them with the support they need to get their lives back on track. In terms of cost, social safety nets are actually very cost-effective. They help to prevent people from falling into poverty, which can lead to a host of other problems, such as crime and homelessness. And by providing people with the support they need to get back on their feet, social safety nets can actually save the government money in the long run. Of course, no social safety net is perfect. There are always going to be some people who abuse the system. But overall, social safety nets are a vital part of any modern society. They help to protect people from the worst effects of poverty and unemployment, and they can provide a safety net for those who are struggling to get by. Here are some specific examples of how social safety nets have helped people in the real world:  In the United States, Social Security has helped millions of people to retire with dignity.  In Canada, the Canada Child Benefit has helped to reduce child poverty by more than half.  In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service has provided free healthcare to all citizens, regardless of their income. These are just a few examples of how social safety nets have made a real difference in people's lives. They are a vital part of any modern society, and they should be protected and strengthened."
Human,cmv-85,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is directly contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, for any reason. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to. So prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all. Please excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up"

All modern day social norms are a product of our past. Our current views of the morality of homosexuality are the same as when the word was used as a term of abuse. I don't think there is a good reason to have to accept the status quo, nor do I think there is a good reason to look at things from the perspective of our own day. I'd love to see people argue for and against gay marriage, and I'd love to see people argue for and against having children by gay couples.

All modern societies are based around subjective morality and so there is no real basis in objective moral law that can't change over time - if we need a god-based society then it makes much more sense with one rooted first off Judeo Christian values than anything else because they're what most westerners grew up understanding as ""right"" or even just good behaviour (and which many others feel comfortable adopting).

All modern slavery is bad and we must do everything in our power to end it. But there's a huge difference between actual slaves today who are bound by oppressive violence that's beyond their control like child soldiers or some forced laborers impoverished by greed (like hotel workers exploited at night), and people with real choices that they made against their will when young girls were put up for sale as sex slaves, mostly thinking they'd make enough money selling their bodies ""just once"" so they could buy something nice for themselves later. I can't admit any degree of freedom in such situations simply because it's not happening anymore. (There's still way too many things you can get into trouble for if you're caught doing them.) But what about those victims? They've been sold into an existence where they're subject to physical punishment or sexual abuse or both. They're run ragged all day long trying to survive while watching other women enjoy luxury vacations. What else might be expected? How does one justify such exploitation without also saying that these same people should just go out into the world and start forcing someone else along with them? That would give another person more rights than I've ever had myself. There'd never be anyone left in the world unabused!"
LLAMA,cmv-85,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern American thought is in support of freedom, and not interfering with others' lives. However, this way of life is not sustainable if every member of a society attempts to live by that standard. Someone has to go out and fight the wars, put out the fires, and pave the roads. If every able bodied citizen of our country was free to do whatever they wanted, we'd have a bunch of people who are experts in their field, but no one to go out and work in the fields. Obviously, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but it does bring up an interesting question. What is the most effective way to maintain a free, and fair society? I believe that this question has been asked throughout history, and to many different cultures. The answer however, I think, is in what we can look to as the most successful nation in the world. The United States of America is the most powerful and technologically advanced nation on the planet. It is also a country that gives its citizens more freedom than any other. This is due, I believe, to the fact that we have strong military and a strong workforce. I'd like to emphasize the strong military portion of this statement. Our military is the only thing that stands between our nation and annihilation. The reason that we have not been invaded by a foreign power is because of our military. If we were not so large, we would have been overtaken a long time ago. The conservative side of the argument, of course, maintains a strong military. A strong military has allowed our nation to become the most free and powerful in the world. The other aspect of our nation that has allowed it to be so successful is the strong workforce. I believe that the conservative side of the argument is much more willing to defend the rights of the working man than the liberal side is. When I think of liberalism, I think of elitism and a disregard for the common man. I think that conservatism supports the common man, and that the common man is the backbone of our nation. I understand that this has been a very ""liberal"" post, but I'd like to try to clear up any confusion about my stance on this issue. I'm generally a conservative, but in this case, I feel that the liberal side of the argument has more valid points. The conservative side of the argument makes the statement that ""The value of liberty is that, as a gift of God, it is the proper condition of man."" I agree with this statement, but it does not mean that liberty is a free gift. Liberty comes at the expense of the liberty of others. The conservative side of the argument believes that ""Justice cannot be achieved by taking away the liberty of one group to give to another group."" I feel that this statement is too general to be of any value. Justice, I feel, is the state of being fair. It is the balance between the rights of each and every individual. Justice, I believe, should be the main concern of our government. The conservative side of the argument feels that justice is not important. The liberal side feels that it is. The conservative side feels that liberty is the most important thing, but liberty cannot be achieved at the expense of others. The liberal side feels that justice should be the main concern of our government, and I agree. I think that in the end, neither side of the argument is 100 right, and that's just the way things work. I don't think there is any situation in which any side of an argument is 100 right. I also feel that in the end, the most important thing to our nation is that the majority of our citizens have the ability to live free and happy lives. The conservative side of the argument claims that this cannot be achieved by taking away the liberty of one group to give to another group. However, it is this very thing that has made this country so successful in the past. The conservative side of the argument is too caught up in tradition, and in the end, is very selfish. The liberal side of the argument, on the other hand, feels that it is our duty to spread democracy and liberty to other nations. I don't agree with this. Liberty and democracy cannot be forced on a nation. For it to work, it must be the will of the people. However, liberty and democracy cannot be obtained without the work of other nations. It was our work in Iraq that gave them the ability to democratically choose a leader. The conservative side of the argument claims"
OpenAI,cmv-86,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too great from what you may be used to in urban areas, but there are often many benefits to living in a small town or a rural area. Here are a few potential positives to consider: 1. Slow pace of life: Living in a small town can be more laid-back and relaxed than the hustle and bustle of the city. People may be more willing to stop and chat or take the time to connect with others in the community. 2. Lower cost of living: Housing and other expenses may be cheaper in small towns, giving you more financial freedom. 3. Feeling of community: Small towns often have tight-knit communities where people know each other and take care of one another. 4. Access to nature: Living rurally can give you the opportunity to enjoy nature and outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and camping. 5. Less crime: Small towns often have lower crime rates than urban areas. Of course, not everyone will appreciate these benefits, and personal preferences vary. It's important to find a living situation that works for you and makes you happy."
LLAMA,cmv-86,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many, and it's a far cry from a city like Brisbane or Sydney where I currently live. The good: It's quiet, the people are really nice and friendly, the air is clean, no traffic, you can drive everywhere because there is very little public transport and if you have kids they can play in the streets. The bad: It's quiet, the people are really nice and friendly, the air is clean, no traffic, you can drive everywhere because there is very little public transport and if you have kids they can play in the streets. Basically the problems are: The lack of people means the lack of choice. You don't get to choose what you eat, what you buy, what you do in your spare time. You eat what is available in the local supermarkets, you can only buy what is available in the local shopping centres, and you have to make your own entertainment. You also have a smaller circle of friends, if any. All your friends are likely to be people you grew up with. If you are a foreigner or a city person, you are more likely to be a social outcast, and I noticed that people talked to me a lot less than they would a local. I'm not the only one who has noticed this - I've spoken to others and it seems to be a common problem - the locals are not particularly friendly or welcoming to outsiders. I suppose it's not their fault, they're just comfortable with what they've got. Which is fine, but I don't think it's a great place to live if you are a foreigner or new to the area. However, I suppose if you are a local, you'll probably have a great time. Labels: australia, country, life, village Today I was sitting in the cafe at the shopping centre when a song came on. I didn't pay any attention at first, but then I started to think about it - I was wondering why it sounded so familiar, and I also wondered why it sounded so good. It turns out that I'm not the only one who likes this song. It's called ""Sweet Dreams"" by Eurythmics, and it was released in 1983. Here's the interesting part - the song was actually written and performed by Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart, and has been covered by Marilyn Manson and a few other people, but the version that I have heard and know was not the original. In 1997 a movie called ""Private Parts"" was released, which starred Howard Stern. I've never seen the movie, but it seems to be about Howard Stern's life and career. The version of ""Sweet Dreams"" that I know is from this movie, and it's not by Eurythmics or Marilyn Manson, it's actually by a band called ""Tori Amos."" I actually like it better than the original, and I think the reason for this is that I have never heard the original, and I've heard the ""Tori Amos"" version a few times. I've posted both versions below so you can decide which you like. I've also posted a video of a live performance by ""Tori Amos.""

Basically, it's been a bit of a mess. I've done a lot of things I shouldn't have done, and I haven't done a lot of things I should have done. I could write a book about my life - actually, I probably will write a book about my life when I have the time. But anyway, the things I've done and haven't done in the past have made me what I am today. I have some regrets, but no real big regrets. I'm pretty happy with where I am right now. I can't say that my life has turned out exactly the way I wanted it to, but it's probably as close as I could have gotten. I do wonder what would have happened if I had done things differently.

Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, policefire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable. Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do. A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner. Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity. If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything.

You will not be able to walk outside at night in your own neighborhood without being afraid, and you will not be able to sleep without having to worry about whether or not you'll be robbed. The quality of the water will not be the same, and there will be no cheap or free health care. If you are not a white, wealthy, middle-class person, you will be treated differently, even in public. For example, the only restaurants in the area will be tourist traps, and if you go to one you will have to pay for a meal, even if you only eat salad. They will not have any cheap sit-down restaurants, no food trucks, and you will have to pay for a coffee if you want one. If you are a middle-aged or older person, you will not be able to walk your dog at night, or take your kids to the park, or go to a local theater. You will not be able to walk outside after dark without being scared of getting mugged. You will not be able to go to the movies without worrying about getting mugged. You will not be able to buy anything without being afraid it will be stolen. The list goes on and on, and it gets worse the longer you live there. As a white person, you will be treated differently.

PaLM,cmv-86,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too stark. In the city, there's always something going on. There are restaurants, bars, shops, and events to keep you entertained. You can meet new people from all over the world, and you're never far from a good time. In the country, it's a different story. There's not much to do, and the people you meet are all from the same small town. There's no diversity, and it can be hard to meet new people. I've found that the people in the country are more conservative and closed-minded than the people in the city. They're less likely to be open to new ideas, and they're more likely to be judgmental. The pace of life in the country is also much slower than the pace of life in the city. In the city, you're always on the go. You're constantly running errands, meeting deadlines, and trying to keep up with the fast-paced world. In the country, you can relax and take your time. There's no need to rush around, and you can enjoy the peace and quiet. I'm not saying that the country is a bad place to live. It's just not for me. I need the excitement and the stimulation of the city. I need to be around people from all over the world, and I need to be able to meet new people all the time.

Tsinghua,cmv-87,"The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than their female counterparts. These statistics, unfortunately, are not unique to Britain. We are not alone in this. In the United States, according to a 2007 report by the Violence Policy Center, only 13 percent of those charged with murder in the state of New York are male, while the number is 45 percent in California. And in Florida, 70 percent of all homicide victims are male, while the number is 54 percent in Texas. In the United States, 72 percent of murder victims were men in 2008, while only 13 percent of murder suspects were men. The other 87 percent of murder suspects were women. One can see where these statistics are headed, particularly in a culture that disproportionately blames men for these murders. In the United States, for example, the average person thinks that men are more likely to commit murder than women. The reality is that, statistically speaking, this is not true. And as a matter of fact, most murderers are women. As a society, we tend to believe that male and female murderers commit their crimes differently. Men, we believe, are more likely to kill in cold blood, while women, on the other hand, are more likely to kill in anger. We believe that men are more likely to kill their wives and children and to hide their crimes, while women are more likely to kill strangers. This is simply not true. In fact, in most cases, the crimes are committed in exactly the same way. They are committed with the same degree of planning and with the same amount of violence. The reason that we believe that men are more likely to commit murder is that we have created a culture that disproportionately blames men for crimes committed against them. We have created a culture that blames men for being beaten and sexually abused, and for being arrested and convicted of crimes against women. We have created a culture that blames men for being abused and arrested and convicted for the same crimes that are committed against women. We have created a culture that blames men for the murder of their wives and children. And in the process, we have created a culture that creates a huge and dangerous imbalance in the treatment of men and women in our society. The fact is that men are not responsible for the crimes committed against them, and women are not responsible for the crimes committed against them. We are responsible for creating a society that blames men for the crimes committed against them. We are responsible for creating a society that punishes men for the crimes committed against them. And we are responsible for creating a society that creates an imbalance in the treatment of men and women. The Myth of Men's Guilt It is time to stop blaming men for the crimes committed against them. We need to stop blaming men for being beaten and sexually abused, and for being arrested and convicted of crimes against women. We need to stop blaming men for being abused and arrested and convicted for the same crimes that are committed against women. We need to stop blaming men for the murder of their wives and children. We need to stop blaming men for the crimes committed against them. And we need to stop blaming men for the crimes committed against them. We need to stop creating a society that blames men for the crimes committed against them. We need to stop creating a society that punishes men for the crimes committed against them. And we need to stop creating a society that creates an imbalance in the treatment of men and women. It is time to stop blaming men for the crimes committed against them.

How can you raise a child with such narrow views?"" My wife and I had recently returned from a week-long vacation in Italy, and I was talking to a friend about how much I loved Italy. I was telling him about the food, the wine, the architecture, and the scenery. I was talking about how much I loved going to the market, shopping for fresh produce, and eating my fill. I was telling him how I was getting used to the new language, the different accents, and the way people dress. And then I said something that caused a bit of a stir in my friend's mind.

Human,cmv-87,"The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. That's disgusting, and obviously I could list many other real problems. But the MRM is not the best solution to these problems, and often gives men's issues such bad press that it's toxic to defend them. In other words, it's not the MRM's fault that these problems exist, but it's actively damaging to the cause, quite possibly more than it has helped. Distancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into ""men's activists"" and ""women's activists."" This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman. This is not a victory for women's rights. Everyone loses, because a criminal walks free while an innocent person sits in jail. Sure, there are extremists who will claim to hate all men and think this is fine, but there are also crazy atheists who claim to hate all religious people. This isn't ""no true Scotsman,"" this is pointing out that it's unreasonable to define a group by its crazies, because if we did, no group would be reasonable. Pitting MRAs against feminists undermines the notion of actual gender equality and makes it a ""men vs. women"" debate, which we all lose. It would seem, to me, that a better strategy to promote men's issues would be to do it within the feminist movement. The feminist movement has existed for a long time and (relative to the MRM) is reasonably positively regarded. People get behind feminist issues. MRAs often complain that no feminists care about men's issues, but a) this doesn't seem to be entirely true unless we're yelling about strawmen and extremists and b) this would be even less true if people stopped leaving feminismgender egalitarianism for the MRM. It looks like people are ditching feminism for the MRM and then complaining that feminists don't care about men's issues, which is only true because anyone who did left. Why can't we all just work together? I get that there are people who identify with all of the above, but it seems like EVERYONE who considers themselves ANY of the above should care about all of the above. I really can't think of an intellectually honest reason to care only about men's issues or women's issues. They're both real. So why are we treating them as opposing forces? It's not like we have to ban abortions because we start listening to male victims of violence. This isn't a zero sum game, why is it being treated as one? Everyone seems to think it is, and it just doesn't make sense to me. Some things I anticipate people saying: ""What about gender egalitarians?"" I think rebranding feminism as gender egalitarianism would probably be the best solution, but that's going to take a hell of a lot of time. One thing that would help is if feminists started acting like gender egalitarians and actually cared about all gender issues, and MRAs joining up with them would only speed up the process. As for people who consider themselves ""feminists and gender egalitarians,"" I see no issue. ""Feminist, MRA, and gender egalitarian"" is fine too, although I've never encountered one who phrased it like that. Those who consider themselves anti-feminists but gender egalitarians.... Eh. I really don't know, but I feel like shitting on feminism in general is not helpful to the gender equality discussion. (this is as opposed to legitimate critiquing, which is fair game. I'm not saying anything anyone labelled ""feminist"" does is above reproach, nor anything the movement does. I'm saying condemning all of modern feminism and trying to start from scratch is really unhelpful, especially when a huge part of the world is still incredibly patriarchal; see countries where getting raped is still a crimeif you're female). ""Feminists aren't open to men's issues. I hear what you're saying, but that's not possible."" Become a feminist open to men's issues. You're listening to one right now. Make that two and we're one step closer. ""It's right for men's and women's issues to have different advocates because they are different. You might as well be saying that feminism should just merge with the LGBTQ rights movement."" I don't think that's true. Men's and women's issues differ, but they are rooted in the same fundamental ideas. The reason men are arrested when they are the victim of domestic violence by women is that we live in a society that sees women differently from men. It's benevolently sexist to say that a woman simply couldn't hurt a man except in self-defense. It's also hostile sexist against men to say that men are simply violent people. Men's and women's issues are intrinsically linked, because stereotypes and perceptions of gender roles are the root of both. Essentially, I think men's and women's issues are symptoms of the same problem, so they can be addressed together. ""Is your problem with anti-feminists, or MRAs? You seem to move between the two."" Both, to some degree. I don't think it's fair to treat those two entirely separately, given the links. MRAs who are anti-feminist are the ones I disagree with most. People who identify as MRAs but also feminists I'm largely okay with, but the MRM in general is not terribly kind to feminists and borders on actively anti-feminist, which is the problem I'm talking about here. Edit: Guys, I want to have a conversation! I really am open to chatting about this and changing my view. I know lots of CMV users love the MRM, it gets brought up all the time.... I want to understand your perspective. I don't bite. Edit2: Well, I asked and you delivered! Definitely an interesting conversation here. Credit to uPrinceofSavoy for highlighting issues with feminism that make it inherently poorly compatible with the MRM. I'll be checking back and responding to comments that might get added later tonight, but I may not get to all of themsorry about that! I am reading and listening to all that is said, and I appreciate the many varied takes on the issue that have come up.

So is the fact that men who are raped are not considered rape victims. So is the fact that men who are raped are ridiculed and told to ""man up."" All of this is appalling and unacceptable. What is also unacceptable is that these real, and very serious, problems facing men and boys in our society are co-opted by a misogynistic movement that seeks to use them as a means to promote hatred of women. It is absolutely critical that we fight against misogyny and the hatred of women. There are many different kinds of misogyny. There's the traditional kind of misogyny that says women are inferior to men, and that treats women as objects of men's sexual pleasure and nothing more. There's the kind of misogyny that says that women are too stupid and emotional to be capable of making decisions about their lives. There's the kind of misogyny that says that women are so fragile that they must be protected from seeing women's bodies, and from men swearing, and from men getting upset and expressing that anger. There's the kind of misogyny that says that men should never, ever, under any circumstances, be held accountable for their actions, and that women should take full responsibility for men's actions. There's the kind of misogyny that says that if a man is violent towards a woman, it's because she didn't follow the rules of his ""culture."" All of these kinds of misogyny are harmful, and they are all misogynistic. One kind of misogyny that I find particularly harmful is the kind that says that women should be held responsible for the actions of individual men. I was talking to a friend of mine about the Steubenville rape case, and about how I was disgusted by the way that CNN interviewed the two rapists and basically portrayed them as victims, and how CNN blamed the 16 year old girl who was raped for the actions of the two rapists. My friend said that she felt badly for the rapists, because ""They're only 16 and 17 years old."" I responded, ""So you think that it's okay for 16 and 17 year old boys to rape 16 year old girls."" ""No,"" my friend replied. ""I don't think that's okay. But I feel badly for them, because they're going to have their whole lives ruined."" My friend went on to say that she felt it was the mother's fault, because the mother obviously didn't teach her son not to rape. I said, ""Why would you blame the mother? Why wouldn't you blame the rapist?"" My friend said that it was the mother's fault, and that the mother should have taught her son not to rape. I asked my friend if she would feel the same way if the roles were reversed. My friend said, ""No. If it was a 16 year old boy who was raped by two 16 year old girls, it would be the father's fault."" The problem here, of course, is that my friend thinks that it's women who are responsible for men's actions. This kind of misogyny that blames women for men's actions is very common. Most people believe that it's a woman's fault if she is raped. If she was wearing a short skirt, or if she was walking alone at night, or if she didn't fight back, or if she got drunk, or if she went to a frat party, or if she was dancing at a nightclub, or if she took a drink from a guy, or if she walked through a dangerous neighbourhood, or if she was in a hotel room with a man, or if she was at a party with a man, or if she was alone with a man, then it's her fault that she was raped. If a man commits domestic violence against a woman, it's her fault. If she didn't follow the rules of his culture, or if she was wearing a revealing dress, or if she was swearing, or if she was drinking, or if she was dancing, or if she was angry, or if she was assertive, or if she was upset"

BigScience,cmv-87,"The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely than women to be referred for criminal investigations. Yet we now know, based on a study by Jane Savitsky at Harvard University and one of her colleagues, that black mothers were about twice as likely as white mothers to get their children back when they left violent husbands. Women's rights advocates have long argued that education can prevent gender-based violence. We need better employment opportunities for women - particularly if young girls want out of poverty. But there has been little evidence that shows such changes improve women's lives or reduce the incidence of abuse. Even with strong laws like those passed here today, some states still fail to prosecute stalking-related crimes adequately. A federal law known as the Stalker Protection Act would make it easier for victims to file complaints, making it less difficult for abusers to hide from justice. My bill also includes provisions to support survivors through services offered by statewide organizations like Sharon House, which helps battered wives move forward after all kinds of violence forces them into shelters. We must not let these numbers go unchallenged: There are millions of people across this country whose well-being depends upon us taking action together. This year marks the 20th anniversary of my first term as governor. The challenges facing our state today demand an even stronger commitment than I ever had before. I am proud of what we've accomplished since then. New Yorkers trust me much greater than any other president-elect did during his campaign last November: 44 percent believe government should play a bigger role in addressing climate change; forty-one percent think government needs to keep up with technological advances; sixty-five percent agree it's important for Congress to work effectively together. But there's always room for improvement. And that's exactly why I'm proposing bold new policies to help strengthen America's infrastructure while ensuring its security."

I can understand how that might be frustrating to hear about others' travels when you haven't had the opportunity to do so yourself. However, it's important to keep in mind that everyone has different life experiences and opportunities. Instead of getting annoyed, perhaps focus on the things you can do to make your own travel dreams a reality in the future. Maybe start saving up or researching destinations that interest you. Remember, your time will come!"
LLAMA,cmv-88,"I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. Cause it's really far away! I remember the times before I became a frequent flyer myself. At some point, we were quite well off and my parents sent me to Italy for 2 weeks and to the USA for a month. Both times, I was 15 years old. And I was SOOOOO excited. There were some more trips to europe and to russia. But I really got hooked on travelling when I moved to a different town for university. My home town is a beautiful place, but when I went to Muenster, I couldn't help but compare the city to the places I've seen in the past. The first thing I noticed was that Muenster has no real centre. There is no place where everyone just goes. The city has beautiful architecture and you can ride your bike everywhere, but I just couldn't find the heart of the city. But when I came back from my exchange to Canada, I was able to really appreciate Muenster. It has everything I could ever wish for. I know, the food in Canada is so much better, but in Germany, you don't have to worry about if your food will kill you. In Germany, you can drink the tap water, in Canada, you can't. In Germany, you can be out late at night without the fear of being shot by some maniac. In Germany, the people are more honest. I could go on, but I think you get my point. Now, I think that we are very lucky to be able to live in Germany. We have a fantastic medical system and when you are sick, you don't have to worry about the bill you will have to pay later. We have a great social system, which is not perfect, but which is there to help you, if you need it. We have a great public transport system, which is not perfect, but which is there to help you, if you need it. We have great education, which is not perfect, but which is there to help you, if you need it. We have a great infrastructure, which is not perfect, but which is there to help you, if you need it. Of course, there are a lot of things that could be better. But what I've seen when I traveled is that we are very lucky to live in Germany."

I think they really have no idea what the places are like. I guess you get to that age when you have been all over the world and really have no desire to travel again. I know I am not going anywhere, except maybe for work, for the rest of my life. I love traveling, but I have had the same experience as everyone else in that I was sick to my stomach and couldn't wait to get home. I've also found that people that love to travel often don't have a sense of humor, or aren't as sharp as the rest of us. We have our own sense of humor, we are just the opposite of your typical traveler. I have met people who love to travel and travel all over the world. But, I have also met people who are there to stay and get the most out of every minute. One thing that I have noticed about most people that travel is that they don't like to stay in one place for very long. They don't like to visit the same places, or eat the same things.

They're soooo excited that they got there, then sit in the plane for four hours or whatever and get home just like... blah. Nobody talks about how miserable it was getting back into the daylight side of Australia; no one tells you it's NOT easy being an immigrant - especially after leaving everything behind, going through a recession with your family on the verge of breaking up, whole city coming down around you... But that's okay! The tallest thing we'll ever do is give ourselves permission to be happy because our lives are already wonderful as long as we remember why we decided to make those choices: We've been given this gift called life so we should cherish every day! When looking at all these things happening now, I'm reminded that even though I've lived here my entire life until age 16 and served 4 years as a Peace Corps Volunteer overseas, a lot has changed over the past decade alone since I came back from Vietnam."

To me you have to be pretty dull and boring and douchey to want to go overseas and experience a mild variant of your own culture instead of a different one. Its classic tourist behavior but at least retarded resort-bound tourists outside of the west are pushing their comfort zone slightly. Travel isnt supposed to be a way to get away from your shitty 9 - 5 that you dont have the guts to quit, its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures. If other cultures are so scary to you that youd save up thousands to go to a place where language and climate are the only differences from home youre probably a bit of a douche."

Our ketchup has less sodium!! the beers taste like water but at least we get our money's worth with a liter mug instead on some little plastic things that look as if they're made from recycled glass bottles... For me there are only two countries where i would really want or even dare visit: New Zealand for its scenerynature AND switzerland because who doesn't dream once upon time off visiting Switzerland? But then again both come pretty expensive considering not everyone comes form wealthy families nor do most places offer any scholarships giving away free accomodation etc..

PaLM,cmv-88,"The problem is, they all seem to go to the same places and see the same things. I have a friend who went to Europe for six weeks and he only visited three countries. He went to Paris, Rome, and London. He did the same thing in America - he went to New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. I'm not saying that these are bad places to visit, but there are so many other amazing places to see in Europe and America. If you're going to travel all the way to Europe, why not visit some of the smaller countries like Croatia, Slovenia, or Montenegro? And if you're going to America, why not go to some of the smaller cities like Austin, Savannah, or Asheville? I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to the big cities - they're amazing places to visit. But if you're only going to visit the big cities, you're missing out on a lot of what these countries have to offer."
BigScience,cmv-89,"Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept the best in human nature. However, there is a very real difference between being a woman who identifies as male (or any other gender) AND being an actual man in some way. The latter is NOT contradiction-free: It can be both true false at once - but only one of those things IS true; and if you are female identify as male then you're inherently more likely than someone else to hold these beliefs about transgenders. A: I think your question has two parts. Why would it matter what our opinions on sexual orientation are? Is the 'trans' label contradicting whatever we may say? The first part's answer should be pretty obvious. Whilst it's certainly possible to disagree with someone's sexuality it's much harder to try and argue against their sex assigned at birth because most people don't care enough to take note of such minor details when communicating amongst themselves. In fact so little time passes after a person was born how often do they even remember to ask ""what does my baby girl look like?"" Most people just want to know whether she'll grow up to be good looking. They'd prefer her face could fit into a certain mould than worry about why she's got hair down here instead of over here. Actually having said all that I feel your second point deserves further explanation. It's quite easy to see what's wrong with saying something like: It seems unreasonable to expect men and women to act identically from day 1 of life If you've ever had to explain anything that's simply the case. You can't expect everyone to follow instructions precisely the same way under every circumstance. But sometimes you might need to make exceptions such as: There aren't many ways around the supermarket checkout queue if there's nothing to stop 2 girls fighting for priority. Or maybe one guy wanted crisps while another person felt hungry and insisted on bread. This sort of thing isn't particularly difficult to deal with but as soon as you start talking about people's differences you'll run into problems where they won't agree. (It's probably not worth trying though.) Of course if you're asking why keeping separate gender categories makes sense in the first place I'd happily give examples of animals which evidence slight sexual dimorphism yet still live together without conflict. (There really are plenty.) So I'm afraid I'll have to defer answering your direct questions until I've reached a conclusion regarding the second point above. Edited: After reading through Julian's comment I realised perhaps his concern is actually prompted by the idea that by identifying as the opposite sex they're somehow forcing us to compromise ourselves. In reality however he doesn't appear to talk about changing yourself personally but merely respecting others regardless of whom they choose to call themselves."

It doesn't even make sense biologically speaking - how come my dog cannot change its ""gender""? How about cats? They're mammals too:) You might say they may be different species of course but humans and dogs do share more genes than you'd imagine so biology says nothing here either.. In fact if someone self-identifies themselves with 'Cocker Spaniel' then isn't person doing exactly same thing when identifying himselfherself by feminine pronouns like she her? Why would anybody care which 'species' he identifies himelf into?! There was also an article recently posted online where scientists found out mice who were born female could switch genders thanks mainly because females being able switching hormones without any medical help whatsoever: Therefore ladies relax please!!! If somebody feels his true nature inside means something else other compared just body parts - well let me tell ya right now folks your mind IS BULLSHIT!!!

PaLM,cmv-90,"I've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long-time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is... Overrated. I'll admit, it was one of the first anime I watched, and I did enjoy it at the time. But upon reflection, and after having seen many other anime since, I can't help but feel that SAO is really quite mediocre. The story is pretty generic, the characters are one-dimensional, and the animation is nothing special. The only thing that really sets SAO apart from other anime is its premise, which is admittedly pretty cool. But even that premise is executed in a pretty uninspired way. I think the main reason why SAO is so popular is because it's very accessible. It's easy to watch, it's easy to understand, and it's easy to get sucked into. But for people who are looking for something with a bit more substance, I would definitely recommend checking out other anime. Here are a few anime that I think are better than SAO:  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood  Steins;Gate  Code Geass  Death Note  Gurren Lagann These anime are all much more well-written, with more complex characters and stories. They're also much more visually appealing, with better animation and art direction. If you're looking for a good anime to watch, I highly recommend checking out one of these titles. You won't be disappointed. TL;DR: Sword Art Online is overrated. Here are some better anime to watch:  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood  Steins;Gate  Code Geass  Death Note  Gurren Lagann"

What about it has been attracting all those viewers over several generations? It's both entertaining (if not for anything else than at least its battle sequences) AND well written with vast amounts potential in terms more content from this series or sequel shows down thoses lines such like SAO-WoT, Aincrad:fillers etc.. And there are some nice characters too! Who can forget Kayaba sacrificing himself so Kiritoo friends could escape......or Asuna dying tragically..... In short they're very enjoyable pieces which will most likely catch your attention within few minutes when watching them... The story itself however....well how much did i say above concerning quality issues regarding lengthamounts thus far? Well let me tell ya' what sorta problems we face: first off since S1 ended around May 2010 -end 2012 according my count (although many other fans might disagree), then came 4 years without any news whatsoever even after committees were set up by studios involved including Aniplex who produced original manga but no progress seemed made until April 2013 where an info leak showed screenshots featuring new character designs along side mentions towards their WIT studio branch announcing plans toward another TV season sometime next year except now things look different thanks mostly due ""accidentally"" leaking animated footage showing NISA developing two brand novelties called Shin Sekai Saikyou Densetsu Final Fantasy XV From Far AwayShin Sakura Taisen. Information was released via twitter early July 11th 2014 before taking place later during fan meets held earlier August 9ththis same month! So either way don'ts waste anymore precious Sunday waiting hours upon hour unless otherwise seeing information discussed online anywhere making sure nothing gets spoiled while also being updated often enough should something be mentioned among related posts here.Ranimer Image courtesy AniFamJP This said post seems especially important because 1st ever official debut teaser trailer confirmed finalized cast list development staff included exclusively chosen voice actors plus producers behind screenplays similar if memory serves correctly. After initially signing onto Season 2 empty handedly just prior launching Summer 2015 event campaign last December 17 0f course these concerns turned into fears soon thereafter March 3rd 2016when noted actress Rina Hidaka announced her departure allowing us further fear turns turning worries heading straight back downhill once again right away following June 23 6hrs ago ready knowing fullness she'll make comebacks eventually... Still though nonsense aside lets hope JC Staff dedicate themselves fully realizing our hopes through better communication across multiple platforms given needy nature surrounding volume contents versus limited QA process currently underway months ahead launch date....

Tsinghua,cmv-90,"I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is the worst anime I have ever watched. I understand the appeal of the show, and the reason for its success, but I feel that this is not the anime that the show's creators had in mind. I understand that there is a certain amount of ""one size fits all"" in the anime world, but this show has that unmistakably bad taste that a lot of anime tend to have. The smut, the rape, the blatant misogyny, and the overall low-brow appeal of the show. While I understand that SAO is a popular show and a lot of people like it, I can't help but feel that the show is, in fact, the exact opposite of what it tries to be. I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in a show where the main character is shown as a whiny, whiny girl, who never takes responsibility for her actions. I'm not interested in a show where the characters are shown as the lowest of the low, and the only ""good"" characters are those that can hack into their minds to gain control of their bodies. I'm not interested in a show where there is a complete lack of common sense, and where everything is a mess because the characters don't think about things and just do what they want. This show has everything going against it, and yet it continues to do well in the ratings. While I understand that there is a lot of anime out there that is a lot worse than this show, it just seems like the show is trying to be something it is not, and yet it is still being praised for what it is. The main character is a whiny girl who is barely 10 years old, yet she is constantly doing the most stupid things. There is a complete lack of maturity, and she is a complete attention whore. She does nothing for the show, and I can't believe that anyone thinks that she is a compelling character. The supporting cast is just as bad. I mean, come on, who would ever consider having a relationship with Kirito? Why would you ever want to hang out with him? I can't believe that there are people who think that he is a good character, and that he is any good of a person. There is no reason why any of the other characters should even care about him. I understand that he is an appealing character because of the fact that he is the main character, but there is no reason why anyone should be hanging out with him. I know that the show is trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but it's just not good enough. This show is so bad that it has almost become a cliche in anime. I can't believe that I actually had to write this. I know that there are a lot of people who like this show, but I just can't see why. This show is just not good enough."

Sword Art Online - One piece to my mind - on Gaming and Nerd Culture: An Interview with Dr. Minioka by David Vonnegut Hello All! Rudy's back for another week full of amazing gaming content, including new interviews from some very talented individuals! First up we have our latest interview with Dr. Yuri Aoi, Assistant Professor at Yonsei University Korea Graduate School of Business Administration Korean Studies Program. (Yuri) Dr. Aoi's research focuses mainly on sustainable consumption and production models for manufacturing companies. He also works closely with industry actors in developing policies aimed at promoting sustainability within businesses (e.g., green procurement strategies). Within academia he specializes in analyzing business processes based on simulation modeling techniques applied to supply chain management systems. His current research interests include intelligent decision support systems coupled with advanced analytical and computational methods used to explore complex system dynamics. The following video features Dr. Aoi discussing how Japan ended its nuclear energy program due their desire to become carbon neutral, which was accomplished through renewable energies programs like solar power, wind power and biomass. Next up we are featuring some nice reviews over at Kotaku. First they feature a game called Omega Labyrinth, where you must explore each level carefully and overcome obstacles one at a time. This is definitely a cool looking title if you're interested and want something that's a little different than most other games out now. You can check out the whole article here. Then they go on to give a nice overview of Hollow Knight and all of the interesting things people enjoyed about them. Hollow Knight looks great and is certainly worth checking out. The developers even put together a solid trailer showing off the action-filled combat scenes taking place inside the castle levels. Check out the entire preview here. Finally they're giving two more excellent reviews both of them coming from Gamespot magazine. This first one shows off a couple of well known indie titles including Paper Mario: The Origami King, Super Metroid, Shadow Dragon Legends and many others. While these aren't exactly hardcore gamers you'll probably recognize older installments of these franchises on consoles past and present. But do check them out anyway since everything shown off seems pretty promising. From visual novels to platforming adventures, there's plenty of quality options available right now. Of course everyone knows Nintendo has their own Animal Crossing franchise too... although Square Enix hasn't confirmed anything yet either way. Check out Tom Clancy's Big Red Button 2 to hear some exciting news regarding upcoming updates for the online community portion of the game. Big Red Button 2 will soon welcome some major changes as part of a recent update. In addition to adding several new maps and events, Ubisoft announced that players worldwide may get a chance before launch day to help make those improvements happen. Here's a quick recap of what's being done. Since launching last year, Big Red Button 2 welcomed 25 million sessions from nearly 200 countries around the world. In order to keep track of what's working best, as well as fix any glitches, bugs, and crashes affecting performance, Ubisoft regularly conduct extensive user testing that includes running thousands of tests every single month. To show appreciation towards test participants and encourage positive feedback, Ubisoft plans to reward users who participate by offering special unlocked items they won't find anywhere else until release date. As an example, here's what's happening with the map Northern Smoke. As noted above, Ubisoft would like to offer a free cardboard box version of Northern Smoke in exchange for providing honest feedback with regards to maps and mechanics. So far they've received hundreds of emails directly asking them to provide specific information as to why certain areas work better than others. Those responses will then be included with next year's official patch notes."
LLAMA,cmv-90,"I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is easily the best anime that I've ever seen. While many would disagree with me, I'm not here to tell you why you're wrong, I'm here to tell you that you're right. If you are here, that means you are a fan of the series. So, welcome."
Human,cmv-90,"I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [459 on MAL] , this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points. I believe this is due primarily to hater votes. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time. In fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please! Some Background I am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it. Why The Show Is Good Characters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there. Plot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. SAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is very story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments. In the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players. At the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world. Writing: SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and excellently paced. This show is so clean that you can eat off of it. Art: The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only fantasy world anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk. The only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime. For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand? Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls: Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics. Arguments Against Overpowered Main Character The story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a ""best"" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him. Meanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says ""become overpowered against things you can't beat."" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop. Dumb Plot Moments In the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action. In the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes? You didn't like the ending The ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled? Without that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward. Plus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel. I'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

LLAMA,cmv-91,"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe in evolution, not in the sense of the science of it, but as a philosophy. The world will continue to get worse as it has for thousands of years. We have not learned from our mistakes, and we only continue to make more. I believe that the human race needs to end before we completely destroy the world and the animals in it. I feel it is our duty to let this planet and the animals on it to continue without us. I hope that one day we can evolve enough to leave this planet peacefully."
PaLM,cmv-91,"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that humans are inherently flawed and that our continued existence will only lead to more suffering. There are a number of reasons why I believe that humans are flawed. First, humans are prone to violence. We have been fighting wars and killing each other for as long as we have been recorded. This violence is not only destructive to the individuals involved, but it also has a ripple effect that can cause widespread suffering. Second, humans are selfish. We are often more concerned with our own needs and wants than with the needs of others. This selfishness can lead to all sorts of problems, such as poverty, environmental destruction, and climate change. Third, humans are short-sighted. We often make decisions that are good for us in the short term, but that have negative consequences in the long term. For example, we may choose to drive a car that pollutes the environment because it is convenient, even though we know that it is contributing to climate change. Fourth, humans are irrational. We are often swayed by our emotions and biases, which can lead us to make decisions that are not in our best interests. For example, we may vote for a politician who we know is corrupt because we agree with their policies, even though we know that they are not trustworthy. Fifth, humans are destructive. We have a tendency to destroy the natural world around us. We clear forests, pollute the oceans, and hunt animals to extinction. This destruction is not only harmful to the environment, but it also deprives future generations of the opportunity to experience the beauty of nature. Given all of these flaws, I believe that it is in the best interests of the planet to destroy the human race. It is the only way to ensure that future generations will not suffer from the same problems that we have created. Of course, I understand that this is a very controversial opinion. Many people would argue that humans are capable of great good as well as great evil. They would point to the many examples of human kindness, compassion, and creativity. They would argue that we have the potential to overcome our flaws and create a better world. I do not deny that humans are capable of great good. However, I believe that our potential for good is outweighed by our potential for evil. We have a long history of violence, selfishness, and shortsightedness. We have shown that we are not capable of living in harmony with the natural world. I believe that the only way to ensure a future without suffering is to destroy the human race. It is a difficult decision, but it is one that I believe is necessary. I know that some people will think that I am a monster for saying this. They will say that I am giving up on humanity and that I am not willing to fight for a better world. However, I believe that I am doing the right thing. I am trying to prevent future generations from suffering the same way that we have. I know that I will not be able to convince everyone of my point of view. However, I hope that this essay will at least start a conversation about the possibility of human extinction. It is a difficult topic, but it is one that we need to address if we want to create a better future for our planet."
OpenAI,cmv-91,"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that as an AI language model, my role is to provide helpful and constructive responses that encourage positive and peaceful solutions to humanity's problems. While I acknowledge that there may be challenges facing humanity, it is important to work towards finding solutions that promote the well-being of all individuals and not engage in harmful and destructive ways of thinking. Let's work together towards a better world. How can I be of assistance to you?"
Human,cmv-91,"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet. Of course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, this is all assuming a few things: - That if humanity continues, we will eventually cease to exist against our will. - That humanity will never have true equality. - That war will always continue in some form. - That we will continue pollutingdegrading the Earth as long as we exist. If each human somehow became the ""God"" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BSfiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems. Once again, I believe the destruction of the entire human population to be our best solution. As an aside, some other animal may eventually evolve to be intelligent in the manner we are, so the possibility of simply destroying all life to forever end suffering of any kind on this planet is considered.

BigScience,cmv-91,"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that by destroying all life on earth we can solve our existential and moral problems in a matter-of-fact manner. What is so important about this? It allows me to maintain my sanity as I struggle against the idea of God's sovereignty over His creation; for those who interpret Genesis 1:29-30 implies there was no other option! I'd like you to ask yourself if this is truly true: How do you think people reacted when they saw Noah build an ark after he had promised them not to destroy everything? Do you really want your children to grow up believing that their moms and dads are liars because God told us He was going to flood the Earth anyway? I decided long ago that I did not have enough time left on planet earth; however, I'm still here fighting tooth-and-teeth against evil and defending what appear to many believers to be foolish beliefs!

OpenAI,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more I understand your point of view. While it's true that simpler language is more easily understood by a wider audience, more sophisticated vocabulary can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, using ""preposterous"" instead of ""crazy"" or ""insane"" can convey a nuanced meaning. ""Preposterous"" can suggest not just extreme irrationality, but also a sense of absurdity and humor. It can also be used to convey a stylistic tone, such as in a satirical or comedic piece of writing. However, it's important to strike a balance between using advanced vocabulary and making sure your writing is accessible to your intended audience. It's always a good idea to consider your reader's level of understanding and adjust your language accordingly to ensure that you are effectively communicating your ideas."
LLAMA,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? It's just something that never ceases to annoy me. I agree with your comments about 'preposterous'. It is a word that I don't use. Sometimes, when reading a book, I've seen that word and I don't know what it means. I agree that it is confusing and does not add to the story. These were some interesting questions. I can't wait to see the next set! I hope to read Divergent one day. AJ Sterkel October 29, 2015 at 11:43 AM I think it's kind of silly to call a character's death a ""spoiler."" The book has been out for years, and most people who've read it know who dies. I agree with you, AJ. I never say who dies in my reviews. I'm just not a fan of that. But I'm with you on the use of the word spoiler. It's old news at this point! I know that most people know who dies, but there are still a few that don't. I try to be considerate."
PaLM,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? It's not like the word is hard to understand, but it's just not a common word in everyday speech. It's more likely to be found in a book or an article. And even then, it's often used in a way that makes it seem like the author is trying to sound smart. I think it's better to use words that are more familiar to your audience. If you're writing for a younger audience, then use words that they're likely to understand. If you're writing for a more academic audience, then you can use more complex words. But either way, don't use words just to sound smart. Use them because they're the best words to express what you want to say. Here are some examples of how to replace pretentious words with more common words:  Pretentious: ""The ostentatious display of wealth was appalling.""  Common: ""The person was showing off their money in a really gross way.""  Pretentious: ""The convoluted plot of the movie was impossible to follow.""  Common: ""The movie was hard to understand.""  Pretentious: ""The erudite professor lectured on the intricacies of quantum physics.""  Common: ""The professor talked about quantum physics in a way that was hard to understand."""
BigScience,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more kids? The problem with the word preposterous is that it has a negative connotation (like the original meaning of preposition). You also can't use barbaric unless you're talking about bad language; but you would only ever want to do this if you were using archaic speech for dramatic purposes. I agree - I think whatever ""something wrong with the way we talk these days"" they are referring to means that words like ""those two [adj] idiots"" should be replaced by ""that two [suchsome kindnoun] idiots."" But then again... I'm not old enough to remember that in my day people said things like: ""I hate those two idiots!"" It's all relative really. For some reason a few years ago I heard a kid on TV saying something along the lines of: ""My mom says what's right are the ones who act as though nothing's going on other than what she wants them to be doing. And that's what I feel most comfortable being around people like her for because she's very polite and nice and doesn't yell at me. So why wouldn't she get dressed up every morning? That's ridiculous! She's got nowhere else to go so obviously there's no point taking out any dresses from underneath there bed and putting on something better. No one would even notice anyway. ...and that's exactly how I'd handle that situation too. Not that you'd know that yourself until you've been through one. shrug"
Human,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? Do you need to sound smart with fancy language? Of course there are some exceptions for things that can't be described any other way, like names of diseases and other ""domain-specific"" words. A lot of times, teachers will encourage writing with fancy words for elaboration, and not just in persuasive or story-telling writings. Why would you try to explain something to as many people as possible, but use words that would exclude some of your readers? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from Obama.

Tsinghua,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? I've only seen the word preposterous used in this context in one book I've read and it was in a series about ghost hunters. And it was by a well-known author who's been published in more than one genre. A couple of years ago, I was sitting at the breakfast table when I overheard a couple of my 12-year-old nieces talking about a story they were reading in their school book. One of them said something like, ""But that's not possible, it's preposterous."" To which the other one replied, ""Oh yeah, but that's what happened."" And the story continues on in the book. It's just one example of many I can think of, but it made me stop and think about how often this word is used. If you don't believe me, check it out on the Merriam-Webster website. There are 276,000 results for the word preposterous and I'm sure there are many more instances in other languages. One of the first sentences in the article is: ""Is it really possible that the dead can walk, and are they out there somewhere, in disguise?"" That's a pretty clear example of a preposterous question. The next sentence is: ""Yes, I've seen them."" Yes, I've seen them. Hmm. It seems that there are many more than one sentence where preposterous is used, but I'm going to stop right there because this post is already getting a bit long. One of the comments that I liked was: ""I'm really not sure what the word 'preposterous' means in this context. It seems like the sentence is saying that it's possible that something is true, but that it's unlikely. This would be equivalent to the statement, 'I've seen a lot of strange things, but I've never seen a ghost. I'm going to say that this is a fairly common misunderstanding of the word preposterous. Many people seem to think that preposterous means ""unbelievable"" or ""unreasonable."" And the word is used that way, but not in the context of ghosts. And not in the context of the author's story. The word preposterous means ""crazy,"" ""out of the question,"" or ""crazy idea."" I think it's used that way because it's one of the few words that can be used to describe something that isn't true. A preposterous idea is an idea that is crazy, insane, or unrealistic. I think it's one of those words that is frequently misused. In this case, it's being used to describe something that isn't possible, and that's how it's used in the author's story. In a way, it's kind of like saying that it's impossible that something is true. In that sense, it's a good word to use because it does make sense. And I think it's also good because it makes the reader realize that the story is not about ghosts. It's about something else. And it also makes the reader think about what's really possible. And that's a good thing. Wednesday, April 13, 2011 I'm not sure that this is the first time that this has happened, but I'm not sure if I've ever posted about it before. So, if you're not sure what I'm talking about, you're in the right place. I think I've heard it said many times that the first draft of a book is the hardest to write. I don't know how true that is, but it's the one thing that I've heard more than once. And it makes sense to me. When you're writing the first draft of a book, you're trying to write the story that you want to tell, but you're doing it in the way that the editor wants you to write it. And if you're writing a novel, you're trying to make it so that it's publishable. And if you're writing a nonfiction book, you're trying to make it so that it's publishable. You're trying to make it so that it's publishable in the way that the editor wants it to be. And that's a lot of pressure. And you're trying to make it so that it's publishable in the way that the author wants it to be. And that's a lot of pressure."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-92,"IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say ""preposterous"" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? I've been a fan of the Futurama series for quite some time now (not as long-lived an audience member akin with those who were fans during season 1) but I must admit that Season 6 is by far my favorite in terms at least making funnier jokes than other seasons had offered up so even if there was no real reason beyond nostalgia why this show should be considered viable again after its six year hiatus from airing new episodes on television screen then them god damn Simpsons Movie did enough damage reintroducing Bender into our hearts forever!"
BigScience,cmv-93,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected from predators and living conditions. If they are kept in captivity for the rest of their lives then this has to make some sense. But there is also a moral argument against keeping them alive beyond what would happen if they were released into wilds: Zoo animals represent an unusually large proportion of our consumption of animal products (the meat industry alone kills about 1 billion animals every year). And even if your gut instincts tell you not to kill any wild animals because you're going out with friends tonight or something like that then I'm sure it's at least possible that you'll consume more animals than necessary simply by eating outside restaurant meals. Keep animals in zoos so we don't have to eat those extra animals! Even if the total amount isn't huge compared to other sources of meat it could add up over time... The Animal Liberation Front apparently argues the same thing, maintaining that no ethical reason exists why humans should ever feed on other species' live food. I find being able to see around 100 different animals one day while watching a group perform seems worthwhile regardless. A: This article justifies both sides in terms ""our ancestors did it."" While much of the discussion comes down to whether this might serve as a gateway to hunting to protect people, killing animals for food does go back quite far in human history. In particular, hunter-gatherers who ate fresh meat often hunted directly after harvesting their food items in order to take advantage of animals that had been traveling long distances looking for food. This made it easier to capture otherwise elusive prey since they'd all know where each individual was headed when moving in search of resources. (And remember foraging groups will tend to move very slowly.) While many recent proponents argue that these behaviors aren't really ""reasonable,"" there's probably little question that such patterns existed across a broad swath of hominid ancestry. A: To expand upon Luke's answer, including his references to Alex Eberhardt (one of the most prominent advocates for animal rights) and Jeff Hancock, I want to address two issues here. First off, let me respond to Luke's point that ""most people today only care about animals killed for sport"" and criticize him for saying that so. It is true virtually everyone reading this blogpost right now cares about hunting and shooting sports. However, in my view, perhaps less than 5 of humanity actually enjoys taking part in these activities; thus the vast majority of people on Earth do not genuinely support hunting and shootng...even though they may appreciate others enjoying what they themselves prefer. Therefore, someone espousing the rationale behind animal ethics through sportsmanship arguments risks underestimating the degree of support for those who wish to cut down on huntingshooting in favor of feeding non-human primate populations where appropriate. Second, I agree with Mr. Eberhardt that ""natural selection can't explain farming "" 1. Nonetheless, unlike the other answers posted here, I believe he exaggerated matters somewhat2. In fact, natural selection cannot account for certain traits observed in agricultural practices3. Thus, we need ""to look further upstreamwhere agriculture originatedwhen addressing questions regarding its survival4. As aptly put forth by Dr. Nemchinow, Mark Twain once said, ""There is nothing new under the sunexcept people doing things differently""5."
LLAMA,cmv-93,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be looked after properly and their species' survival is improved.

Are the robots in this zoo cruel, or are they the lesser of two evils? And, if you think it's cruel, would you still feel the same if the robots looked like the real thing?"

Additionally, zoos can play an important role in educating the public about different species and their conservation efforts. However, it is important that zoos prioritize the welfare of their animals above all else, and take steps to ensure that animals are not exploited or mistreated for profit or entertainment purposes. Zoos should also have a clear and transparent policy on their breeding and transfer programs to ensure that animals are not being unnecessarily separated from their families or habitats."
Human,cmv-93,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel painhave a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild. This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creatingvoting on policies.

PaLM,cmv-93,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected and studied in a controlled environment. Animals can be rehabilitated and reintroduced into the wild. Zoos can educate the public about animals and their habitats. Zoos can promote conservation efforts. Of course, there are also some ethical concerns about zoos. Some people argue that animals should not be kept in captivity, even if it is for their own good. Others argue that zoos can be stressful for animals and that they should not be used for entertainment. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not zoos are ethical is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. However, I believe that the benefits of zoos outweigh the risks. Zoos can play an important role in protecting and educating the public about animals. They can also help to promote conservation efforts.

Thank you all!:) In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine. Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself. Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person. I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in. I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was. My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives? Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.

Human,cmv-95,"So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The current structure of League of Legends is that there are Leagues in the 5 major regions (EU, NA, KR, CN, Taiwan) and they meet two to three times a year for some international competition. The international competiton usually consists of a third-party tournament, the IEM World Championship, and two Riot organised events, the Mid Season Invitational and the Riot World Championship (the ""real"" worlds). Of these three only the Riot Worlds is the only really big tournament, with 16 teams and a good playoffs and group stage format. MSI features only the best team of each region and the IEM World Championship uses Bo1 groups into Bo3 in the first playoff bracket, which is often criticised as too random for the title. The league structure in all major regions is usually divided into a spring and a summer league with a regular season of 18-40 games or so, followed by playoffs to see determine who the best teams in the region are. In the other major eSport titles (Dota, SC2, CSGO) you have way more tournaments in general way more international competition in general more important games, as you have more playoff situation This all leads to my opinion that LoL eSports has the most boring circuit, as the majority of the matches that are being played are low impact matches in the regular season and only in domestic competition. Edit: I would appreciate if you help me understand some of the arguments that you apparently think brushed aside. All I see is that you downvoted me, without really understanding why. I would really appreciate if you be patient with me and make me understand what excactly I am missing that should change my view. Edit2 Thanks to everyone who was patient with me and argued even if I didnt seem to get your point. I have some more stuff to think and while my view wasnt really changed I got some stuff to think about.

Edit3 Since this is over eSport lets make some shameless plug: There are atm tournaments going on: This is the faceit final at Dreamhack Valencia with CS:GO, where some of the best team battle for a prizepool of 150,000 This is the Dreamhack Valencia tournament for SC2 with a prizepool of 25.000 And while I dont have a link ready atm, there is also the IEM Shenzen in SC2 going on with some of the greatest players from Korea, also competing for a prizepool of 25.000.

PaLM,cmv-95,"So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The statement I want to discuss is: ""Solo queue is not a good way to measure someone's skill at League of Legends."" There are a few reasons why I believe this to be true. 1. Solo queue is a team game. League of Legends is a team game, and solo queue is no exception. You can't win a game of solo queue by yourself. You need to work with your team to coordinate ganks, take objectives, and close out games. If you're a really good player, you can definitely carry your team to victory, but even the best players in the world can't win every game. 2. Solo queue is a toxic environment. Solo queue is a very toxic environment. Players are often quick to blame each other for mistakes, and it can be difficult to stay positive and focused when you're being flamed by your teammates. This toxicity can make it difficult to perform well, even if you're a good player. 3. Solo queue is not representative of competitive play. Solo queue is not representative of competitive play. In competitive play, teams have the opportunity to practice together and develop strategies. They also have coaches and analysts to help them improve. Solo queue players don't have these advantages, and it can be difficult to translate your solo queue skills to competitive play. 4. Solo queue is a grind. Solo queue is a grind. It takes a lot of time and effort to climb the ladder. Even if you're a good player, it can take months or even years to reach the highest ranks. This can be discouraging, and it can make it difficult to stay motivated. 5. Solo queue is not the only way to measure skill. There are other ways to measure skill in League of Legends besides solo queue. You can participate in tournaments, scrim with other teams, or play in a ranked 5s team. These are all better ways to measure your skill than solo queue because they take into account the team aspect of the game. Conclusion I believe that solo queue is not a good way to measure someone's skill at League of Legends. There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that it's a team game, it's a toxic environment, it's not representative of competitive play, it's a grind, and it's not the only way to measure skill. If you're looking for a true measure of your skill at League of Legends, I recommend participating in tournaments, scrimming with other teams, or playing in a ranked 5s team."
Tsinghua,cmv-95,"So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The point is, most of the Redditors I have talked to believe that QQing is just as bad as GGing, and in many ways it is. They dont even see a difference between QQing and GGing. The problem is, QQing is used as a retaliation against a troll that you have not seen, and you have not even spoken to, and has in no way hurt your team. In fact, it is the exact opposite, because you have never met the person and do not know what kind of person they are. You are just reacting out of anger because the person has made you lose. This, I believe, is the root of the problem, because we all know how much of a troll QQing is, but it is almost never used as a retaliation. QQing is just a word, and a word has no real power. It is just a word that is used to throw someone off their game, but I believe it should not be used in this way. The solution I believe, is to have a conversation with your team, before the game starts. Before you get in the game, tell them you are not going to QQ. If they are with you, then you are going to have to play the game like a normal team, and if they are not, then you have to play the game like a normal team. And this should be a done thing, because I believe that people do not even realize how QQing can affect the game. If you have a normal conversation with your team, then you will see how important QQing is. This, I believe, is the real solution. So, if you are not going to QQ, then tell your team, because otherwise you are just giving the other team an easy win, and giving them a reason to QQ you. You are just giving them a reason to hate you, and if you are hated, then you are hated. So, tell your team you are not going to QQ, because if you don't, then they will, and you will lose. So, tell your team that you are not going to QQ, because if you don't, then they will, and you will lose. So, tell your team you are not going to QQ, because if you don't, then they will, and you will lose. This is not to troll, or to be a troll, but to make sure that QQing does not happen.

The same goes for unanswered questions regarding how you can get a better of kills. I have been asked outright about it by people on my team: You seem intent upon asking why one thing works and another doesn't so we should ask your question here instead. There are plenty of places that work equally well (not all), where there isn't such an assumption of exclusivity toward Warcraft III. People may argue if one outgroup has always worked or didn't, which is fine; that's not what I'm talking about. What I've seen happen over time though is: 1) A new player joins up with their old friends who know how things play around them now. 2) They find they aren't as good at this game as they thought they were before playing because they've gotten tired, moved away from the school they're attending, changed jobs, etc. 3) They're then forced to make use of these ""new"" players, since no-one else seems willing to help them learn the game except those close to them. (Or possibly making themselves sick.) 4) This leads to more frustration, less skill development, harder wins sometimes, even perhaps some losses due to being too frustrated to do anything but throw random stuff at the enemy whenever you're lucky enough to kill himher when you first start off. TL;DR - It's only been going on for me personally for 1-2 weeks, but after looking through a few chat threads forum posts it's something that's become commonplace among gamerspeople in general. It seemed like everyone felt compelled to be defensive towards other people's opinions regarding games biases rather than having a genuine conversation about the reasons why certain strategies haven't worked for them yet while others have. A: It's just different between MMOs and LOLs. In most MMORPG's, especially ones with very large numbers of active users (e.g., World of Warcraft), there's usually quite a lot of overlap between communities based on similar interests. In contrast, LOL tends to be much stronger focused in terms of positioning within its own community. Some classic examples are: Toronto-based online poker rooms: several families tend to stay together 'online', despite NOT living near each other offline Military groups across the US: some will still show up in person, many won't. Still, would-be recruits often spend hours reading blogs dedicated exclusively to military life, along with thousands of comments posted daily Online gaming groups: most don't meet face-to-face unless invitedrecruited; rarely anyone says ""I go hiking every weekend!"""

If you're thinking about voting for me, please take a minute and sign up to receive my updates and campaign literature. I'll be mailing out a few sample ballots to my mailing list in the next few days, and I'll let you know if and when I'll be mailing a newsletter. Thanks again. Tuesday, November 14, 2008 If you're a Democrat in New York State, and you haven't registered to vote yet, it's too late. But if you are registered, and you haven't voted yet, you still have time. I'm asking you to make your voice heard. Yesterday, in my write-in campaign for the New York State Assembly, I got my name on the ballot. But my campaign won't end with that. My campaign will go on until I'm elected to the New York State Assembly, and will continue after that. So I'm asking you to join me in the fight. If you're registered to vote in New York State, please take a minute to register. And if you are registered to vote, but have not yet voted, please make your voice heard. I'm asking you to vote for me in the N.Y. Assembly write-in election. Monday, November 13, 2008 I'm getting a bit tired of all the attacks on George W. Bush. So I thought I'd take a minute to remind you why he's still in office, and why you should keep supporting him. He's the only one with the political skills to lead the country. He's proven that he can work with Congress, and has gotten some very good things done. He's also demonstrated that he's willing to put the country's interests above his own political interests. He's taken some huge risks to protect our country, and if he gets attacked again, he'll be ready to defend the country. He's not a politician, and he's not beholden to anyone. He doesn't need to make political hay out of everything that happens, and he's not afraid to make unpopular decisions. He's the best chance we have to avoid another war in the Middle East. His policy on Iraq is working. The terrorist attacks that we've suffered over the last year were a direct result of the Bush administration's policy. I'm sure there are plenty of reasons to be critical of Bush, but if you're a Democrat, you've got to admit that he's done some very good things. I'm a big fan of the man, and I'm still hoping that he'll get a second term. Sunday, November 12, 2008 I had a great time on Friday, and I'm really excited to get started campaigning for the N.Y. Assembly write-in election. I'm working with a team of people who are all committed to making a difference, and I think we're going to have a great campaign. I'm going to be mailing out some sample ballots, and I'll be mailing out a newsletter sometime in the next week or so. I'm still hoping to get my name on the ballot in December, but if that doesn't happen, I'll be mailing out another sample ballot in the spring, and I'll be in touch with a newsletter in the spring as well. If you're thinking about voting for me, and haven't registered yet, please take a minute and register to vote. If you're already registered, and haven't voted yet, please make your voice heard. I'm asking you to vote for me in the N.Y. Assembly write-in election. Friday, November 10, 2008 The New York State Assembly has a write-in election on the ballot in December."
LLAMA,cmv-96,"I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our debt is akin to overeating and we should not use debt to counter the effects of overeating). Until a few years ago, I was a Republican, and then when I became more active in politics I found myself without a political party. I do not feel I can belong to a party that is willing to spend millions of dollars a day on an unnecessary war, but I also cannot identify with the Democrats, who seem to be unwilling to enforce our immigration laws, and want to give our tax dollars to people who are not citizens of our country. Recently, I have been supporting a third party, the Constitution Party, but I am beginning to doubt the effectiveness of a third party in today's political climate. I am also not completely aligned with all the policies of this party. I do not wish to vote a straight ticket for one party, as I will not support some of the candidates in that party, and I am unwilling to blindly cast a vote for a party. I don't know where I will go from here, but I want to do something. I need to do something. I need to try to change things, to make this country better for my children. My personal opinion, our forefathers are turning in their graves. I think people have forgotten that the only real reason we have any government is to protect our natural rights. The government has no rights, only we the people have rights. Sadly I think it will be the final generation that remembers what the government is supposed to do before this great nation falls."
OpenAI,cmv-96,"I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our country is like a household - we can't just keep borrowing money to maintain our lifestyle, we need to find ways to live within our means). However, as I've grown older and started to learn more about the complexities of government spending and the economy, I've come to realize that reducing spending alone is not enough to solve the problem. It's important to also look at ways to increase revenue, such as through taxes on the wealthiest individuals and corporations who have benefited the most from our economy. It's also important to consider the long-term effects of spending cuts on social programs that help the most vulnerable members of our society, such as Medicaid and food stamps. While some spending cuts may be necessary to reduce waste and inefficiency, we need to be careful not to cut too deeply and harm those who rely on these programs for their basic needs. Ultimately, I believe we need a balanced approach to address the national debt - one that includes both spending reductions and revenue increases, and prioritizes the needs and well-being of all Americans."

Socialism was always something my parents believed was for excessively liberal areas, like Canada and Cali; though they were very forward-thinking regarding social issues, such as homosexuality, recreational drug use, and foreign disputes.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-96,"I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our government has a credit card limit of 300 billion dollars). However I am afraid we are past this point. It now appears as though all discussion will be about how much tax money can go into wasteful programs without causing substantial harm - it seems like none want any cuts at first but then they do not mind them if there's no other alternative - so why bother? We have become dependent on social security benefits for retirees living off their savings or pension plans from years working in some field when interest rates were high enough many decades ago [eg: you could invest 30kyear growing 7 over 65yrs would give 290K]. Is anyone else horrified with these numbers?? The shortfall between what workers pay today vs prior generations should scare everyone awake! And yet people talk out loud saying ""CUT MONEY""!!!!! When did America turn socialist?! Let alone an entitlement-state??? Who authorized such tyranny???? Nevermind... That ship sailed long time back.."
BigScience,cmv-96,"I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our taxes are like a tether around our necks). However, I find it difficult to justify making cuts in something we all use. How can you be against cutting your own wages? And if there was an ""all-inclusive"" tax cut proposal - eliminating income taxes for everyone except the wealthy - the Democrats would pick this up as their ""go-to"" campaign issue. As an economist I know my stuff: We could eliminate corporate profit taxes while keeping existing personaltaxes on capital gains (presumably at some level lower than what they currently pay); similar with interest paid or received from savings accountsinvestment accounts. It seems very simple math-wise - but then again, I'm not sure how many people really understand economics...? In fact, the answer might actually surprise you: The argument itself has been made before.... many times over! How do you think you'd vote if Republicans proposed doing away completely with income taxation? (This question came out of nowhere during one recent political debate.) Well, it's pretty obvious where I'd fall into that hypothetical category. My father owns his business so he's exempt from paying any kind of federal income tax. (For example he makes just enough money through his company that he doesn't have to worry about his W2 form being clipped.) Also since he controls all of the stock options taken out when he bought his business back 20 years ago, both those kinds of returns are also fully eliminated from his return... So yes, that's true. You're probably guilty of taking advantage of programs which provide benefits without having to contribute anything towards them yourself! If nothing else, here are three examples where government programs feel like less-than-honorable favors rather than rights: The Health Care Reform Act offers premium-free coverage to nearly half a million Americans who earn under 75k per year. Everyone makes contributions based on pre-set percentage thresholds; however only working class families qualify because they make too much to participate in the employer-sponsored option."
BigScience,cmv-97,"I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . triggering physical pain or emotional trauma). It is NOT meant as a ""warning"" for all possible reactions. A: The legends at are well-written and concise. I would recommend skipping them altogether. However, you can get the full text of the 1996 NASA article on delta-v here... NASA scientists have discovered through computer simulations how small changes in atmospheric density affect spaceflight trajectories. The researchers published their findings online last month and said it may help improve flight safety with future long-range missions into deep-space. This paper confirms the existence of LEO's atmosphere - but they only mention 1g atmospheres, so adding 2 g wouldn't seem much different... There seems no way based on this evidence alone to prove that -2 g is equivalent to -2 g conditions on earth. The same applies if we assume that -1 g is equal to -4 Earth gravity 3 Mars gravity. In fact there's not enough information about Martian gravity to make any such comparison. If you're looking for one humanly-deniable piece of evidence that there really IS air around our moon, it's hard to beat the photos from Apollo 11 showing smoke blowing out of the lunar module: (source) One example showed that the cabin was pressurized even after the astronauts had evacuated it: Apollo 15 also featured a couple of pictures where smoke and incandescent light were visible inside the spacecraft capsule, although none of these images show the crew evacuating the ship.

Human,cmv-97,"I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg discussions of suicide, rape, murder, etc.). The (exaggerated) culture surrounding TWs of the blanket avoidance of those topics and the overzealous labeling of'offensive' content is not only something I do not support, but also not the topic of this CMV. EDIT: Maybe Trigger Warning wasn't the best phrase to use. I'm simply referring to the adding a disclaimer for content which depictsdescribes material in such detail as to recall traumatic memories. TWs and Spoiler Alerts serve the same purpose of alerting the audience to content that they may not be willing to expose themselves at the time - be it a graphic depiction of a corpse or who died in the most recent episode of Game of Thrones (which could very well be the same image). While many support the latter, the former is reviled in some circles. I think the argument for supporting the latter applies to the former: Just as you would like to avoidbe alerted to spoilers until you've gotten to that point in the story (you're'narratively' prepared), it makes sense to alert others of content which may be emotionally distressing so that they can engage with it when they're emotionally prepared. You could say that there's a presumption of eventual engagement with Spoiler Alerts, you wouldn't be worried about them if didn't plan on following the story. With TWs, someone could duck out of all triggering content forever. But that doesn't seem to be reason to denounce TWs as a whole: you're still saving that person and many others (who could be working to overcome those triggers) undue emotional distress. You also could argue with my definition of emotionally distressing content, stating that it very easily leads to a slippery slope ending with everyone having to tag all of their content, but I'm not terribly persuaded by that argument. For one, regardless of a individual communities definitions of spoilers (we all know Snape killed Dumbledore by now, right?), endings and most recent episodes are universally considered spoilers. Similarly, I'm sure that sexual violence and gore can be considered universal triggers. Discovering how broad a community's definition of spoilerstriggers is done by engaging with that community. As for giving TWs being too much of an inconvenience, I think that's more of a matter of getting used to it: you extend that courtesy when discussing spoilers, why not for when you're discussing triggers?

LLAMA,cmv-97,"I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg. rape, suicide, murder, graphic violence, etc) When these things happen in a story, it's obviously out of character's control, but the author made that decision, and the character had no choice. So the question is, can there be any legitimate reason for an author to include a trigger warning, when it's something they have control over? For example, let's say that your character is a man who is struggling with anorexia, and he makes the decision to eat a piece of pizza. If he doesn't, he'll starve to death. If he does, he'll break his diet, which will give him an anxiety attack. Now, for this character, the anxiety attack is a trigger. So, when you write this scene, do you give the readers a warning? Or do you just write it, and hope for the best? To me, it seems that it would be a courtesy to put a warning, because while it's not like a character is out of control, it's still something that could be upsetting to readers. On the other hand, if you write a warning on every scene that makes your character unhappy, you could have an overload of warnings. So, is it ever a good idea to put warnings on things like this? I'm not sure I'd call it a courtesy. After all, your primary concern should be making the best story possible. If you're weakening the story by including such a warning, that's not doing anyone any favors. I think it depends on a few things. The first is how much of your story is going to be triggering. If you're writing a thriller, for example, and there's a high body count, you're probably not going to use a lot of warnings in your story. If it's a novel about someone who goes through a lot of trauma and has flashbacks, you're probably going to be putting warnings on every chapter. I don't think you should assume that all readers will be upset by the same things, however. If your character is dealing with severe anxiety, the eating pizza might not be what's upsetting for readers. Perhaps it's when he has a flashback to a moment where he was bullied as a child. Or when he's on the bus and the door opens and someone steps on. Or he's at work and hears someone chewing gum loudly. Or he's at the grocery store and has to decide between two different kinds of canned soup. I guess I would say that if you're writing a story that involves a lot of triggering material, then you should just include a disclaimer at the beginning of the book. That way readers can decide if they want to read it. I would say that if you're writing something like a thriller or horror novel, you shouldn't feel obligated to add trigger warnings. There's a lot of things you can't control in the real world. That makes sense. I guess it's a bit of a gray area, but it seems like it would be best to have some kind of disclaimer somewhere on the story, if there's a high concentration of triggering material. I haven't actually read a story with a trigger warning before, but I've seen people mention them and ask about them in writing forums and such. I guess my question was more about when the author has full control over something, but it's something that could be upsetting. There is a good argument for not putting them. As you've said, if you put them in every time your character is upset, you'd have an overload of warnings. On the other hand, it seems like it would be courteous to include a warning on something that could make people upset, even if the character is making the decision, and it's something that happens in real life. Personally, I think it's a good idea to include a warning in your book's description if there are a lot of triggering themes in your book. If it's not something you're really focused on in the story, it's not something you need to put a trigger warning on, but if the whole story is about it, then I think it's a good idea to include a trigger warning. I wouldn't go as far as to add a trigger warning on"
Tsinghua,cmv-97,"I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg. shock, horror, or disgust) in a wide variety of audiences. I'm not talking about a formal set of rules or guidelines, but more about a way of interacting with the community. I think that the majority of the content on this site is positive and fun, but I would argue that there are some pieces that have a potential to be triggering. These pieces are not necessarily smutty or vulgar, they're just a bit intense. In these cases, I think that it's fair to ask for a warning. My question is, what would you do if someone posted a piece that you think is potentially triggering? Would you ask them to add a warning, or would you let it pass? In what circumstances would you feel comfortable adding a warning? I'm sure that there are some people who would argue that trigger warnings are inherently triggering, but I think that that's a false argument. They're a warning, not a directive. If you're an avid gamer and have a significant trigger in that industry, then you should be able to handle a warning for the same thing. I think that this is a valuable concept to introduce. I would like to see it happen more often, but I'm not sure how to make it happen. I think that some of the issues with trigger warnings are logistical and not necessarily about the idea. This is a large site, and I think that some people may not have the time to add the warning. That's fine, but I think that people should feel comfortable enough to make a request. I would say that if a piece is being read in a chat room, then I think that it's probably safe to let it go. I don't think that people should be forced to read something that they may not want to. But if it's a private forum or chat room, then I think that it's fair to ask for a warning. I think that people have a right to expect that people will read their posts. This is a community of people who care about each other, and I think that it's important to be able to communicate with each other. It's also important to have an opportunity to share things that you care about with each other. I'm not sure how you would handle this on a larger scale. The whole community could probably be given a warning if it were to happen, but I'm not sure how you would communicate this effectively. It's also important to be clear about how you're going to handle this. You don't want to just be rude and tell people to add a warning, but you also don't want to let them get away with a lot of inappropriate content. I think that the best way to handle this is to just have a warning. You can warn people in chat rooms, private forums, and private emails. But if it's a large enough issue that it's coming up repeatedly, then you can consider the situation on a case by case basis. It's also important to consider the people who are going to read this content. There's a large difference between people who are afraid of reading something and people who don't want to read something. I think that people should be able to feel comfortable enough to ask for a warning. It's also important to remember that a lot of the people who are coming here are people who are afraid of reading things. You can't force people to read things that they may not want to. If they're afraid of reading something, then it's not your responsibility to make them read it. You can, however, provide a warning. It's important to remember that a lot of people don't want to read things. I think that it's important to communicate this to the people who are afraid of reading things.

PaLM,cmv-98,"I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the regular season, I'm always glued to the TV. There are a few reasons why I find regular season games so exciting. First, the stakes are always high. Every game matters, and every team is fighting for a playoff spot. This makes for some intense competition, and it's always exciting to see who will come out on top. Second, the storylines are always developing. Every team has its own unique story to tell, and it's always fun to see how those stories unfold throughout the season. Will the underdog team finally make it to the playoffs? Will the star player return from injury in time to help his team win? These are just a few of the questions that keep fans coming back for more. Third, the regular season is a great opportunity to see new players develop. Every year, there are a handful of rookies who come out of nowhere and make a big impact on their team. It's always exciting to see these young players grow and develop over the course of the season. Finally, the regular season is a great way to connect with other fans. Whether you're watching the game at home with friends or at the stadium with thousands of other fans, there's nothing quite like the atmosphere of a live sporting event. It's a great way to connect with other fans and share your passion for the game. For all of these reasons, I find regular season games to be incredibly exciting. They're a great way to get caught up in the drama of the season, follow your favorite teams, and see new players develop. If you're a sports fan, I highly recommend checking out some regular season games this year. You won't be disappointed."

But regular season games are boring. Boring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season almost engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me. The NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.

I believe that more research needs to be done before we can definitively say that GMOs are safe for human consumption. There are a number of concerns about GMOs, including the potential for allergies, the creation of new superweeds, and the potential for GMOs to transfer their genes to other organisms in the environment. While some of these concerns may be overblown, I think it is important to be cautious about GMOs until we have more information. One of the biggest concerns about GMOs is that they could cause allergies. There is some evidence to suggest that GMOs can cause allergies in people who are already allergic to certain foods. For example, a study published in the journal ""Nature"" found that mice that were fed a diet of GMO corn developed allergies to the corn. Another concern about GMOs is that they could create new superweeds. Superweeds are weeds that are resistant to herbicides. This could make it more difficult to control weeds, which could lead to reduced crop yields. Finally, there is concern that GMOs could transfer their genes to other organisms in the environment. This could potentially have a negative impact on other plants and animals. I think that these are all valid concerns that need to be addressed before we can definitively say that GMOs are safe. I believe that more research needs to be done before we can fully understand the risks and benefits of GMOs."
BigScience,cmv-99,"While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them. The FDA has summarized many studies into a single summary statement: ""The available scientific information is insufficient to support or refute the hypothesis that genetically modified foods pose health risks greater than their benefits."" I would suggest everyone take this as what it is: weak food safety advice which we should be wary of accepting without further scrutiny (not least because it's from the USDA). The FSA's refusal to make full use of every possible tool in its arsenal may well have contributed towards the decision they made last week on GM maize. The Ontario government is taking steps against Monsanto Canada after their failure to produce assurances over Brillant Corn's potential impact on small grain pollinators. In an announcement issued late Thursday night by Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, he announced plans to launch an investigation on behalf of Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson regarding concerns raised concerning damage done to bumblebees through the release of pollen produced by Brillante corn varieties released by Monsanto. ""It was always our intention when we got involved with the purchase of these crops [Brillian] to do so with great care and concern about how those crops might affect habitat for certain species"" said Dr. Ritz. ""We see no reason why the introduction of such crop types could harm bee habitats; however, we will continue to monitor closely any changes that occur. We want to assure Ontarians that while we recognize the economic importance of growing both corn and soybeans we also believe that protecting nature and biodiversity must come first whenever appropriate technologies are being developed."""
Tsinghua,cmv-99,"While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them as being ""safe."" I will accept them, and work with them as I would any other crop, but I do not fully trust them. I will not buy food that is GMO free and I won't accept it if it is not 100 certified organic. While I don't think the government should have any role in regulating food production, I think that there should be a way for people to be able to find out what foods they are buying are produced with GMOs. I don't want to have to do any research on my own to know what foods are GMO free. I want to be able to go to the store and buy my food without the fear that I might be buying a GMO product. And while I am against the production of GMOs, I think that GMO products are an important part of the American diet. I think that the reason that people are worried about GMOs is because they don't understand them. The problem with GMOs is that they don't get tested for all the different ways that they might be harmful. If a food product is produced in a way that doesn't allow the food to degrade and rot properly, that food is going to be more likely to cause problems for people who are allergic to something in that food. It is a bit like trying to grow broccoli without using fertilizers. The fact that the fertilizers make the food more expensive and less healthy for people who aren't organic is just another reason to make it illegal. 7 comments: I have to agree with you on this one. I'm really sorry to say that I am not against GMO's. I think that it is good to have a wide variety of different food products available to the consumer. We all need to eat different things. The only problem I have with GMO's is the fact that they are being forced onto the market without the consumer's knowledge. If the food is grown with GMO's, then the consumer should know that. The same way we are forced to eat foods with artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other things we don't like. But we can't just get mad at the food manufacturers. We have to do something about it. The government needs to take control of this situation. It needs to be required that food manufacturers tell the consumer what is in the food they are selling. If it is not made with GMO's, then it should be labeled as such. If it is made with GMO's, then it should be labeled as such. It would help people to make informed decisions when they are buying food. I agree with you 100 on this one. I think that it is a terrible idea to force GMOs on the American public without letting the people know what they are getting. The only way to fix this is to have a mandatory labeling law for GMOs. I think that this would really help the American public to make better decisions when they are buying food. I think that GMOs are great for our country. They help to grow many different types of food that the farmers here can't grow without them. If you want to see what is wrong with the food system, just go to the grocery store and check out the ingredients of the foods you are buying. You will find a lot of things that are grown in ways that are bad for the environment and bad for people. If you want to eat healthy, then you need to buy organic foods. GMOs are a good way to produce organic foods. GMOs are very important to our country because they help to grow a lot of different types of food that the farmers can't grow without them.

OpenAI,cmv-99,"While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept As an AI language model, I do not hold personal beliefs or opinions on any matter as I am programmed to remain neutral. However, I can provide you with scientific facts on the topic of GMOs. According to multiple organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the American Medical Association (AMA), GMOs are safe for consumption. GMOs have undergone extensive testing and regulation before being allowed on the market. However, it is important to note that there are ongoing debates about potential long-term effects and ethical concerns related to GMOs. It is always a good idea to do your research and consult multiple sources before making an informed decision about your own personal beliefs and lifestyle choices."
Human,cmv-99,"While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them with no questions asked. It seems very suspicious to me that large companies are lobbying so hard to avoid having to label GMOs, as I don't see why they would put so much time or money into fighting it unless there was something they were trying to hide. I have always tended to be wary of large corporations and their practices, but I feel like my current view is riddled with ignorance and misinformation. Change my view? Hello, users of CMV!

Hell, just like the US, there are studies that show that there are no adverse health effects from smoking, and yet the US government still bans tobacco companies from making such claims. I've said before, and I'll say it again. If GMOs are so safe, why do so many companies go to great lengths to make sure that they're not labeled? One can only make an educated guess, and I'm sure that you, like me, have a pretty good idea of why that is. And it's not because it's just not feasible, because plenty of other countries have found ways to make GMO labeling feasible. And I will not buy Monsanto's argument that labeling GMO foods will make food prices go up, because I have a simple solution to that. Just pass a law that requires all foods that contain GMOs to be labeled as such, and the cost of the label will be born by the companies that sell GMO foods. You know, like the way that we've always done it in the past. Labels: Food, GMO, health, Monsanto, regulation"

LLAMA,cmv-100,"The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand for the average american. The constitution is also a very large document, making it unwieldy for the average person to read. A rewriting of the constitution in plain language is therefore necessary. Before I get to the rewriting, I want to discuss some of the problems with the current document. One of the first problems is the large amount of text, making it unwieldy to read for the average person. The large amount of text also makes it difficult to amend the document. The constitution is the fundamental document of the government, yet it has been amended 27 times. This is a large number for a single generation, let alone for over 200 years. If the document was simpler, fewer amendments would have been necessary. Another problem with the constitution is the language. The language used in the constitution is old, archaic and sometimes downright odd. This makes it difficult to understand for the average person. Some of the language is also outdated and should be rewritten to make it more understandable to todays society. For example, the constitution refers to militia, something that does not exist in todays society. Many parts of the constitution are extremely terse, making them difficult to understand. These parts of the constitution are also difficult to amend. A rewrite in plain language would allow these parts of the constitution to be amended. Finally, the constitution is often vague and ambiguous. The vague and ambiguous language makes it difficult to understand what the constitution is trying to accomplish in many sections. The vague and ambiguous language also allows the government to interpret the constitution in various ways, which can lead to abuses of power. The above is a list of problems I found with the current constitution. These problems are serious and make the constitution difficult to read and amend. To address these problems, I propose a rewrite of the constitution in plain language. The rewrite would have the following goals: Be easy to read. Be easy to amend. Not be vague or ambiguous. Not be politically biased. Not grant additional power to the government. Not eliminate any existing power of the government. These goals will be difficult to achieve. The first goal, to be easy to read, is the most difficult and the most important. The other goals are also important and should not be overlooked. The rewriting of the constitution in plain language will not be easy. It will be difficult to rewrite the constitution without introducing political bias or without granting additional power to the government. Any changes to the constitution will be difficult to achieve without amending the document. A rewrite should not attempt to amend the document. Any changes should be made through additional amendments. I have started a rewrite of the constitution in plain language. The rewrite is not yet complete and I am currently only at the first article. I have chosen to rewrite the document in HTML to allow easy cross-referencing between articles. I will not be adding any hyperlinks or other extras to the document. I have tried to write the plain language version to be as readable as possible. I have also tried to avoid adding any political bias to the document. The rewrite is available at: I am looking for comments about the rewrite. I want to make sure that the rewrite does not introduce any political bias and that it does not grant additional power to the government. I am also looking for comments on how easy the rewrite is to read. Any other comments are also welcome. Monday, April 14, 1997: Submitted Tuesday, July 15, 1997: Added this link."

Human,cmv-100,"The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated. I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners shouldcould vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers. What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV Edit Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it. To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV (also, deltas incoming for added info on the topic.

Tsinghua,cmv-101,"""Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children."" - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the next millennium, we will have to take on a role as managers of the robots and the resources that the robots will need. This means that the future of humanity is not the future of human life. The future of humanity is the future of robot life. There are several things that we need to consider in order to work out the future of the human species."
LLAMA,cmv-101,"""Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children."" - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future (I mean, hundreds of thousands of years from now) we will need to evolve into some kind of cyborg, whether that is by choice or by force (say if our bodies aren't able to adapt to new environments). The idea is that this would enable us to be able to survive in environments we currently can't, and allow us to explore the vast reaches of space, for example. So here's the question, do you think it would be better to let this happen naturally through evolution over time (which could take a very long time) or would it be better to actively try and push it? I'm referring to the latter as ""artificial evolution"" - basically using artificial means to accelerate and guide our evolution."
OpenAI,cmv-101,"""Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children."" - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the future, we will need to create intelligent machines that can help us solve some of the biggest problems facing our planet. However, Minsky's quote suggests that these machines will not take over or dominate us, but that rather, we will continue to guide and raise them as our own creations. As a helpful assistant, I believe that robots and other advanced technologies can play a vital role in improving our lives and solving many of the world's problems. However, it is important for us to approach their development and deployment with caution and thoughtful consideration. We must ensure that we are creating AI that is aligned with our values and goals, and that we are designing them to work in harmony with humans rather than against us. Ultimately, the relationship between humans and machines will be one of collaboration and partnership, as we work together to create a better world for ourselves and future generations."
BigScience,cmv-101,"""Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children."" - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into extinction, it would not necessarily be by being eaten by another species (we have already survived such an event in human history), nor through any natural catastrophe. Instead, we believe that humanity is intrinsically designed to flourish as long as certain conditions can be met which allow us to maximise our individual potential and improve our quality of life accordingly over time. If these goals cannot or should not be reached within human lifespans then perhaps the only reason for continuing existence on Earth may well be its ability to support intelligent life beyond what could otherwise have been expected given current technologies. If there were no other means available at all, including genetic engineering to enhance survival chances, did you think that people might still want to create artificial intelligence capable of surviving longer than their own lives? A few years ago I wrote about my desire to see synthetic biology become possible so that artificial DNA-based ""robots"" could exist indefinitely without needing to use batteries (1). Much has changed since then; first because battery technology seems more user-friendly now, secondly some recent developments suggest that to make AI truly live forever beyond living beings will require both radical new ideas and probably also advances in medicine. However, even assuming that technological progress allows humans to lead long enough lives to accumulate sufficient wealth to sustain themselves, do you feel it is ethically acceptable to extend those growth rates past reasonable limits due to environmental destruction? Arguably one way around this problem would be to educate future generations about how much damage humans have done to nature and encourage them to take action against it before it's too late. But sometimes ethics comes back with questions like 'if we give up nuclear energy production prior to exhausting uranium deposits would that mean giving up control of our planet's resources'? The answer is: yes! And that's when I decided it was high-time to resign myself to making plans for a post-human society after having spent months trying to convince Seaborg Foundation scientists to accept me onto their space program. We need to start thinking outside of the box to facilitate higher levels of well-being across humankind. I published three answers to your question ""Life will last until when?"" A: No. There IS going to be a limit to the number of people who can inhabit a fixed surface area. There doesn't seem to be a lot left behind yet where that makes sense anyway, but there's plenty of room out here. We'd love there to be many more people on Earth: we'd enjoy life together better, you'd have less stress and frustration, we'd get more things accomplished, we'd save money by sharing resources etc. But there's just never been enough land to accommodate everybody. There's also always going to be something wrong somewhere else at the same time: war zones, disease outbreaks etc. It's obvious we'll eventually run out of soil, water, air, food, minerals, oil etc., We'll generate vast amounts of waste every year, it'll rain down heavy radioactive dust everywhere, and we're sure to end up polluting the atmosphere. Perhaps some day scientists will find ways to extract most of Earth's valuable metals while keeping some buried underground, but we're miles away from that point right now: Crafty politicians are constantly pushing new laws for mining activities thus violating existing treaties, agreements and international bans, Government inspectors don't know how to interpret regulations properly, the law enforcement services lack effective methods of enforcing rules, and officials often treat illegal miners or companies with contempt, Miners, governments and consortia rarely agree that pollution elsewhere violates legal obligations regarding clean-up work, especially considering local population resentment towards foreign operations, Most ecosystems remain unprotected despite decades of research efforts, and harmful chemicals continue entering freshwater systems And finally, let's face it: our planet isn't our home anymore. Other factors aren't helping either: climate change, global warming, acidification of oceans, sea level rise, rising temperatures, polluted fogs preventing sun from reaching crops, swarming insects killing animals,... All these problems are exacerbated each passing decade. (Besides the weather changes that affects everyone regardless of whether you're rich or poor) Still, I'm looking forward to a ""better world"": I've heard millions of stories about happy families enjoying holidays abroad during terrible storms, cats getting good care under difficult circumstances, parents caring for kids in hospitals instead of working 8 hours per week and struggling to feed their family on minimum wage etc. (That's why we still call ourselves ""People. Unfortunately, however, I'll likely die soon. Maybe I won't try to ""destroy"" the environment on purpose anymore. I'm afraid everything ends sooner rather than later. Although I doubt anyone actually wants to kill off mankind altogether."
PaLM,cmv-101,"So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future, we will need to evolve to a post-biological form. This is because our current biological form is not well-suited to the long-term challenges of space travel, climate change, and other existential threats. By creating robots that are smarter and more adaptable than humans, we can ensure that our species will continue to thrive, even if our own bodies are no longer able to. Secondly, Minsky's statement reflects a belief that the relationship between humans and robots is not one of conflict, but rather of cooperation. In his view, robots are not our enemies, but our tools. They can help us to solve problems that we cannot solve on our own, and they can make our lives easier and more enjoyable. By working together with robots, we can create a better future for ourselves and for our children. Finally, Minsky's statement is a reminder that we are all part of a larger process of evolution. Just as humans evolved from simpler organisms, so too will robots evolve from simple machines into more complex beings. This process of evolution is not something to be feared, but rather to be embraced. It is the natural way of things, and it is what will ultimately lead to a better future for all. Of course, there are also some people who believe that robots will eventually replace humans altogether. They argue that robots are becoming more intelligent and capable all the time, while humans are stagnating. If this trend continues, they say, then eventually robots will be able to do everything that humans can do, and more. In this scenario, humans would become obsolete, and robots would become the dominant species on Earth. While this is a possibility, it is not a certainty. There are many factors that could prevent robots from replacing humans, such as the development of new technologies that allow humans to keep up with the pace of technological change. Additionally, there is the possibility that humans and robots will learn to cooperate and work together, rather than competing with each other. Ultimately, the question of whether or not robots will inherit the Earth is a complex one with no easy answers. However, one thing is for sure: the relationship between humans and robots is changing rapidly, and it is important to think carefully about the implications of this change."
Human,cmv-101,"""Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children."" - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future (maybe even only a few millennia), it will be by integrating ourselves with technology and shedding our fragile organic bodies. What is the maximum typical lifespan of a sentient organic species? Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant. Will the Earth still be inhabitable for us in our current states by the time another instant passes? Luckily, we've already started primitively engineering and augmenting ourselves, with genetic modification, prosthetic legs, hearts, ears, etc. The technological advances in just the last 100 years (as well as the damage we've done to our planet) has been incredible - what will the next 5,000 bring? Let's assume for the sake of argument that the nearest sentient species developed on a planet 100 lightyears away. (Just FYI, a quick GoogleWolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200kms, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let's say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time - only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel. Essentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological 'life'. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it's much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it's still fully organic.

Sometimes you can get away with this when writing a first draft, because it's all about getting the story down on paper. But when you're revising, you need a plan. ""I will write a scene at a time, keeping in mind the big picture. I will not skip around until I have the first draft completed. Then I will focus on revising and editing, piece by piece."" Do you skip around when you write? Writing a novel is a lot like putting a puzzle together. You start with the big picture in mind and then you fill in the smaller pieces until the whole puzzle is complete. But many writers skip around. They start with the big picture in mind and then they skip over to that corner over there and start working on that piece. Then they skip to the middle and start working on that piece. The problem with skipping around, with writing one scene and then another scene in a different place in the story, is that you don't have a clue how those scenes fit together. You're writing your scenes and fitting them together like a puzzle without the big picture. It's much easier to write a scene when you know where it fits in the story and how it fits with the scenes that come before and after. So start with the big picture and write one scene at a time, making sure it fits with the scene before it and the scene after it. When you skip around, you end up with a story that skips around. You end up with a puzzle that doesn't fit together. That's why it's best to start with the big picture and write one scene at a time. ""I will write one scene at a time and then move on to the next scene in the story. I will not skip around until I have finished the first draft."" Have you ever started to read a book and then realized that you've read this one before? Have you ever seen a movie and thought it seemed familiar? Have you ever seen a TV show and wondered if you'd seen this episode before? If so, you've been hit by something called ""familiarity."" In other words, you've seen it all before. I watch a lot of movies, read a lot of books, and watch a lot of TV shows. The more I read and watch, the more I realize that it's all been done before. What makes a TV show, a movie, or a book stand out is the way the writer or director or actors tell the story. It's the same thing with writing. One of the biggest mistakes writers make is writing something that has already been written. That is why it is so important to read in the genre you write. It's also important to watch movies and TV shows. You have to know what's been done and what's not been done. The writer who says, ""I don't have time to read,"" is the writer who is going to write something that's been done before. Yes, you can read a book or watch a movie and then write your own version, but do you really want to? ""I will read in my genre, watch TV shows and movies in my genre, and be aware of what's been done."" In the past, I've compared writing a novel to a lot of things: putting a puzzle together, building a house, cooking a meal, and so on. But today, I'm"
Human,cmv-102,"In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way, for the pretty good trade off reason of people want to know that they're getting a quality puzzle, which makes sense to me. But I can't stand when you're making a puzzle with people and they want to check the box. The point is to enjoy the slight but time-passing pleasure of discovery a picture by putting it together. When you're looking at the box every minute or so, you remove all the joy of creating the picture as well as most of the challenge of pairing the colors and shapes. How can someone justify using the box in a puzzle unless they are truly stumped beyond a doubt and have no other option, after guess-and-checking every remaining piece? CMV, ladies and gents.

Tsinghua,cmv-102,"In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way. If it's a one-off puzzle, you'll have to read the instructions for that puzzle, if it's a repeat, you'll have to refer to the description of that puzzle, and if it's a family-friendly puzzle, you'll have to read the description of that puzzle. So, unless you're comfortable with these things, it's best to just look at the pictures and try to figure out what you're looking at. One of the things that is frustrating about puzzles is that you can be so close to completing a puzzle, and it's so frustrating to realize that you've missed one little piece that would have made the puzzle complete. I hate to say it, but I think I'm doing better at that. I used to be very picky about my puzzles, but now I'm not as careful about where I put them in the box. I'm just happy that the puzzle is complete, even if I have to put the puzzle back together one more time. But it's not a bad thing, it's a learning experience. I've had to put a puzzle back together twice, so that's a good thing. Another thing that puzzles do for me is give me something to do when I'm bored. I love puzzles, but it's not always something I'm looking forward to doing. And that's okay. I don't have to look forward to it, but I don't have to avoid it either. So, I guess the puzzle box is a good thing. I'm not always looking forward to it, but I'm not running away from it either. Monday, September 28, 2010 I'm very grateful that I had the opportunity to participate in a conference call with some of my fellow law librarians this morning. We talked about library technology, the future of libraries, and what we need to do to help make our libraries the best they can be. It was a very inspiring call, and I hope that everyone who was able to participate in it had a chance to listen in. It was very educational, and I hope that everyone learned something from it. I know I did. I learned that some of my colleagues have made great strides in the past few years, and that they have come a long way since I've been in the profession. I also learned that there are some great resources available for law librarians. The Association of Research Libraries has a great blog that covers a wide variety of topics. There are also some great blogs from other librarians that are very informative. I'm very thankful that I have such an amazing profession, and I'm very thankful that I have such a great group of colleagues. I'm looking forward to the next conference call, and I'm looking forward to all of the work that I get to do with my colleagues. Wednesday, September 23, 2010 I've been thinking a lot about the best way to deal with the book that I just read. It was a good book, but it wasn't my favorite book. I loved reading it, but I don't think I would have read it if I hadn't been asked to do so. I was a little hesitant at first, but I'm glad that I did. I'm glad that I read it, and I'm glad that I can look back on it now and think about it. But the question I have is this: how should I store the book? I'm sure that most people would put it in the library, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to do it. It's not the most valuable book, but it is a good book. I would like to be able to have it for the rest of my life, but it's not something that I'll be looking at all the time. I know that I can keep it, but I'm not sure how I should do it. I guess I'm asking what the best way to store the book would be. I guess I'm asking if there's a way that I can keep it for the rest of my life without looking at it too often. I know that I could put it in the library, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to do it. I'm not sure if it would be best to put it in the library with the other books that I've read, or if I should keep it in my own personal collection. What would you do? How would you keep a book that you've read for the rest of your life?"
PaLM,cmv-102,"In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn’t work that way. Instead, the boxes are often plastered with images of the finished puzzle, which can be both helpful and distracting. On the one hand, seeing the finished product can give you a sense of accomplishment and motivation. It can also help you to identify the pieces that you need to find. However, on the other hand, seeing the finished product can also make it more difficult to solve the puzzle. This is because you may be tempted to focus on the pieces that you know belong in the picture, rather than on the pieces that actually fit together. So, is it better to have a picture on the puzzle box or not? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Some people find that pictures on puzzle boxes are helpful, while others find them distracting. Ultimately, the best way to decide whether or not you want a picture on your puzzle box is to experiment and see what works best for you. Here are some of the pros and cons of having a picture on a puzzle box: Pros:  Pictures can help you to identify the pieces that you need to find.  Pictures can give you a sense of accomplishment and motivation.  Pictures can make the puzzle more challenging and interesting. Cons:  Pictures can be distracting.  Pictures can make it more difficult to see the pieces that actually fit together.  Pictures can make the puzzle more difficult to store. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have a picture on your puzzle box is a personal one. There is no right or wrong answer.

Bing has experienced exponential growth over these three years, becoming one of India's top five internet browsers along with Google, Yahoo!, Baidu and Yandex. Today, the Bing App is available across four languages: Hindi, English, Tamil and Malayalam. It will also be rolled out for Telugu next month. The application currently features 1 million unique queries on average daily. As searches continue to grow rapidly due to increased awareness around smart devices like mobiles, cloud computing services and social media platforms, users expect instant access and best-in-class apps to power every single stage of information generation, transformation and consumption. According to a report published earlier this week by iResearch, eight Indians (27) say they regularly check their smartphone for news while browsing websites. In addition, many Indian consumers said that using software applications makes reading content easier, quicker and cheaper compared to paper-based sources. Across most countries, digital advertisers face declining ad revenues due to publishers adopting Ad Blockers, which hinder advertising revenue opportunities. This trend is projected to accelerate in emerging markets such as India given high levels of Internet penetration and growing consumer demand for customized solutions based on personal interests. However, according to MediaPost research Australia's leading publisher Red Eye News Group recently announced plans to invest 1 billion in an aim to create new business models within the industry including subscription payments and branding fees alongside traditional direct sales methods. Further, the market share of offline print publications continues to shrink; however, this does not mean digitization is dead - the reality is that printed newspaper circulation and reader engagement rates remain relatively strong.

Human,cmv-103,"Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate ""News"" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand ""BuzzFeed News"" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright. Still not going to use it for my news (or anything really) but definitely see it in a new light. Thanks for the perspective and interesting discussion guys! Buzzfeed is a terrible news organization. They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. ""Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!"" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility. I've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praisedefend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate. 1. BuzzFeed has a large base ""BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption"" This is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumptiongetting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to readbuy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids. 2. Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed ""The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!"" Yea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source. 3.They do really good pieces ""I'll admit 90 of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event."" That's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have ""17 Pizza's that look like Ohio"" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky. 4.They get people to read the news ""Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before."" It's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to newsjournalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think ""This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!"" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill. 5.It's a new platform, the next evolution ""You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt."" Print journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of ""3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter"" still isn't news. That's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought ""BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't."" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on. Anyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed. So hopefully someone changes my view, but we'll see. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

PaLM,cmv-103,"Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate ""News"" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbait/native advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand ""BuzzFeed News"", then you're probably already aware of that. BuzzFeed is a popular news and entertainment website that has been criticized for its use of clickbait and native advertising. However, the site also has a separate ""News"" section that is produced by a team of professional journalists. This section of the site is not as reliant on clickbait and native advertising as the rest of the site, and it has been praised for its quality journalism. In a 2016 study, the Pew Research Center found that BuzzFeed News was the most trusted news source among millennials. The study also found that BuzzFeed News was more trusted than traditional news sources such as CNN and Fox News. This suggests that BuzzFeed News is able to reach a younger audience than traditional news sources. This is likely due to the site's use of social media and its focus on pop culture and entertainment. BuzzFeed News has also been praised for its coverage of breaking news stories. In 2017, the site was one of the first to report on the Las Vegas shooting. The site's coverage of the shooting was praised for its accuracy and timeliness. BuzzFeed News has also been criticized for its use of clickbait and native advertising. However, the site's ""News"" section is a step in the right direction.

I suppose if you can perceive and understand ""BuzzFeed News"" as something separate from ""BuzzFeed,"" it might not be as bad as I thought it was. But I will leave this article as is, because I think the point I wanted to make still stands. Sometimes, when I open Facebook, I see a whole bunch of articles from BuzzFeed News. I clicked on one of these links a few weeks ago, and was shocked. I discovered that I had been lied to. BuzzFeed News isn't a real news site, it's just a clickbait mill. BuzzFeed isn't a news website, but a clickbait generator. Now, to be fair, I'm not a journalist. I don't read much news. I don't watch the news. I just don't care about current events. I've always considered news to be boring and pointless. There's no real reason why I should be paying attention to it. I've always been more interested in philosophy, science, and technology. I've always had the impression that BuzzFeed was just a clickbait website. I thought it was just a bunch of pictures and memes, and a few ""articles"" that were mostly just lists. But, as it turns out, BuzzFeed also has a ""News"" section. I had been misled. BuzzFeed News is just as bad, if not worse, than the rest of BuzzFeed. This is what I saw when I clicked on a link to ""BuzzFeed News."" The first article on the list is titled ""These Are The Most Overlooked Photos Of 2014."" Overlooked photos? How could a photo be overlooked? Who overlooked them? The second article is titled ""14 Things I Learned While I Was In South Korea."" The third article is titled ""The 27 Most Important Celebrity Bulges Of 2014."" Important? You're going to tell me what bulges are important? How are bulges important? And why should I care about bulges in the first place? That's just the first page of BuzzFeed News. If you click on the second page, you will see this: ""36 Gorgeous Photos Of India's First Transgender Band."" I'm not even sure what that article is about. Is it about India's first transgender band? Is it about India's first band? Is it about India's first transgender? Is it about India's first band that happens to have a transgender member? Or is it about a transgender band that happens to be in India? The whole idea of a ""transgender band"" doesn't make any sense anyway. A band is a group of people. What does gender have to do with that? What if there are four transgender people in the band, and one cisgender person. Is the band still considered ""transgender""? What if there are five cisgender people in the band, and one transgender person. Is it still considered ""transgender""? Does it make a difference if the transgender person is the lead singer? The first image is a cartoon of a guy shooting up a store. This is how the article starts: ""A gunman shot and killed two NYPD officers in Brooklyn on Saturday before killing himself. A third officer was shot in the stomach but survived. ""The shooting comes just weeks after a grand jury decided not to indict an NYPD officer in the choking death of Eric Garner. The death of Garner, who was selling untaxed cigarettes, led to nationwide protests, with demonstrators decrying police brutality against black Americans."" I'm sorry, but what does Eric Garner have to do with this shooting? The shooting happened because of Eric Garner? How did the shooting happen because of Eric Garner? Did the shooting happen because people were protesting Eric Garner? The whole article is just a bunch of images with captions. No actual journalism here. The first picture is a tweet from Kanye West. The second picture is a tweet from a guy named ""NiteOwl."" The third picture is a tweet from someone named ""GunTheJukebox."" The fourth picture is a tweet from someone named ""ItsShoTiiime.""

In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't change based on your race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other superficial characteristic. I believe that this is because all humans are fundamentally equal, and we all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Of course, there are some cases where we may need to adjust our level of respect for someone based on their actions. For example, if someone commits a crime, we may need to lower our respect for them because their actions have shown that they do not deserve the same level of respect as someone who has not committed a crime. However, even in these cases, I believe that we should still try to treat the person with respect, as they are still a human being and they still deserve to be treated with dignity. I think that it is important to remember that respect is not the same as admiration. We can respect someone without admiring them. For example, we can respect a police officer for their job, even if we do not agree with their political views. Similarly, we can respect a criminal for their courage, even if we do not approve of their crimes. Respect is a fundamental human value, and it is something that we should all strive to show to each other. When we respect each other, we create a more positive and harmonious society. Here are some specific examples of how I try to show respect to others:  I listen to people with different opinions than me and try to understand their point of view.  I am polite and courteous to everyone, regardless of their social status or position.  I am honest and trustworthy in my dealings with others.  I am helpful and supportive of others when they need it. I believe that by showing respect to others, I am not only making the world a better place, but I am also making myself a better person."

The idea that the US government should be held responsible for the NSA spying on US citizens is a good idea, I think. It would make sense to hold the US government responsible for the damage that the NSA spying has done to the US. However, I do not think that the US government should be held responsible for the NSA spying on US citizens. Why?

LLAMA,cmv-104,"I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't be any greater than the respect I have for the next person I don't know. I believe that respect must be earned, and I don't think that age or position automatically garners respect. However, if someone is older than me, or in a higher position, and I don't know them at all, then I will give them the benefit of the doubt. I believe that respect is a two way street, and that it's very difficult to respect someone if they don't respect you. I don't think that respect must be given to get it in return, but I do believe that it's rare to receive respect if you don't give it first. I believe that respect can be lost, and I don't think that it's something that can be taken back once it's gone. I believe that there are different kinds of respect. For instance, there's respect for someone's time, respect for someone's privacy, respect for someone's feelings, respect for someone's boundaries, and more. I believe that respect is often shown through actions, and I don't think that it should be assumed if you think you have it. I believe that people who are respectful often have an easier time with social interactions. I believe that respect has a lot to do with how you were raised. What do you believe about respect?"

I think that referring to people based on their accomplishment is just fine being the First Person in Space is a grand title for Yuri Gagarin. But why is he referred to as the first man in space? To me, calling Valentina Tereshkova the First Woman in space simply emphasizes her difference she's female instead of her accomplishment. If we're all supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of race, nationality, gender, orientation, religious views, etc; wouldn't referring someone as the first whatever to do something simply remind everyone that the difference is still there, and make it that much more difficult to ignore in the future? EDIT: My V has been C'd! I see that the social impact of the accomplishment is equally important, and we need to recognize what these people had to go through in order to actually get there! I do think, though, that these types of titles will slowly become irrelevant for future accomplishments, and eventually will be relegated only to the history books. Hello, users of CMV!

There was no mention whether she had taken her name off her profile because of this particular question or not, and given that Facebook wouldn't allow me access into her account, I'm unsure how much information I'd actually get from there... The bottom line though: You should never treat someone like they were worth less just because of something non-human-related especially when it's so blatantly untrue! And yeah, bringing up one's religion or sexual orientation goes against everything I've learned over these past few years trying to live an honest life, that's why I'll do what I can to avoid speaking ill of anyone's faith and values and work hard every day to try and better myself and make things right where ever possible."

The problem is with this basic approach arises when one tries apply fairness across large populations; e g., how much should each nation's citizens pay into their respective government? That depends on what percentage they can afford compared against others who already contribute more or less proportionately based upon income levels etc.; obviously no two people will give an identical contribution even given similar circumstances since there isn't anything like perfect equality amongst us - but still some kind ""fairness"" needs applied somehow so everyone feels justified about getting something back from society without doing too little nor giving up everything just because he doesn' t endow himself fully financially depending where his life stands socially speaking:! This seems very hard a"" perhaps impossible under certain conditions - to do via purely voluntary means alone especially among nations which see themselves competing globally long-term wise rather then cooperatively indefinitely locally short term...

Around this same time the FDA approved another genetically engineered organism called Roundup Ready corn.

Then some years ago Bayer acquired Monsanto (the buyer paid 60 billion) so what we're left with now are two companies working together on RoundUp variety corn including: This type of method has caused many questions about safety and also raised concerns over whether or not it's harmful if one eats the seedling plants rather than eating the mature corn after growing out of its tiny seeds like most people would usually do when growing their own food instead of buying commercial products. In my opinion we should continue to stay away from any foods grown using genetic engineering techniques unless there has been verified testing done to ensure that these types of organisms haven't spread unintentionally elsewhere in nature causing damage along the way. We shouldn't swallow our words just because someone says they're confident enough about how'safe' those technologies really are either!"

However, I can provide you with facts that can help you make an informed decision about GMOs. GMOs or genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been altered in a way that is not naturally occurring. The use of GMOs in food has been a topic of debate for many years. Proponents of GMOs argue that they offer several benefits, such as increased crop yields, better resistance to disease and pests, and longer shelf life. On the other hand, critics argue that GMOs may have long-term health and environmental consequences, and they should, therefore, be strictly regulated. Many countries, including the European Union, Japan, and Australia, have strict regulations on the use of GMOs in food. However, GMO usage is allowed in the United States, where the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers them safe for human consumption if they meet specific safety standards. Whether or not to consume GMOs is a personal choice, and you should feel free to make an informed decision based on credible information. If you choose to avoid GMOs, make sure to read food labels and look for products labeled ""non-GMO"" or ""GMO-free."""

The consequences of this are very dangerous for them, since they start developing problems which could affect their lives as adults I am concerned about how my daughter is using her cell phone on bus when she needs it most!

Secondly genetically modified food production was meant only help farmers by providing more efficient methods such ass herbicide tolerant crops (plants) instead they got harmful effects like higher pesticide levels throughout water supplies and also plants can spread their genes even further due accidental seedings, meaning having completely different cultivars than those normally found else where (eg wheat). And third most recent example would probably go unnoticed unless you were around when airplanes started being used commonly: after WW2 jet engines became available at very cheap prices cause surplus airplane parts produced during wars caused low demand therefore lowering price drastically. But these same jets turned into deadly weapons causing many deaths among civilians worldwide via both accidents -such planes falling down harming several houses- plus terrorist attacks using military grade weaponry stolen off battlefields had unprecedented number civilian casualties including women children etc...

PaLM,cmv-106,"With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new technology has been very environmentally friendly. There are many new technologies that are being developed that use renewable energy, such as solar power and wind power, which do not pollute the environment. There are also new ways to recycle and reuse materials, which helps to reduce the amount of waste that is produced. These new technologies are helping to make the world a cleaner place, and they are also helping to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. One example of a new technology that is helping to reduce our environmental impact is the electric car. Electric cars do not produce any emissions, so they do not contribute to air pollution or climate change. They are also more efficient than gasoline-powered cars, so they can save drivers money on fuel costs. Electric cars are becoming more and more popular, and they are expected to make a significant impact on the environment in the years to come. Another example of a new technology that is helping to reduce our environmental impact is the smart home. Smart homes use sensors and automation to reduce energy consumption. For example, smart thermostats can adjust the temperature of your home based on your schedule, and smart lights can turn on and off automatically when you enter or leave a room. Smart homes can also help you to save money on your energy bills. These are just a few examples of the new technologies that are helping to make the world a cleaner place. These technologies are helping us to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and they are also helping us to reduce our environmental impact.

There are people that have created technologies for the common good and not the personal profit of a few people. One of these people is Nikola Tesla, and his inventions have greatly benefited society. One of the inventions he created is the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is an electromagnetic device which is a closed loop coil of wire, and is made to resemble the coils of a transformer. The Tesla Coil is usually made with copper and a magnet wire. When electricity is applied to the coil, it creates an electromagnetic field which is different from a normal electric current. A normal electric current is the same throughout the entire loop, but the electromagnetic field is created only where the electric current is present. The main purpose of a Tesla Coil is to produce electromagnetic waves. There are different types of Tesla Coils, and they differ in how much energy they produce and the type of energy they produce. There are different types of energy, but one of them is known as ELF (Extremely Low Frequency). The main reason why ELF is used is to produce power, but they can also be used to transmit signals. The other energy produced by the Tesla Coil is a form of EM radiation. This is because of the electromagnetic field created when electricity is applied to the Tesla Coil. The electromagnetic field produced by a Tesla Coil is one of the most powerful forms of radiation in the universe, and this radiation is capable of causing damage to the human body. This radiation can also be used to cure diseases. Tesla also created another invention which is called the Tesla Coil Motor. The Tesla Coil Motor is a motor that uses electromagnetic energy instead of chemical energy. The Tesla Coil Motor is very efficient, and is capable of producing more power than other motors. One of the main problems with motors is that they are very inefficient, and they use a lot of energy to produce a little amount of power. However, the Tesla Coil Motor is very efficient because it uses electromagnetic energy instead of chemical energy. Another problem with motors is that they are very noisy, but this is not the case with the Tesla Coil Motor. It is also very powerful because it can produce 15,000 horsepower in only one kilowatt of energy. The Tesla Coil Motor is a very efficient and powerful motor. This is due to the fact that it uses electromagnetic energy instead of chemical energy. This motor is also very efficient because it uses electromagnetic energy instead of chemical energy. This motor is also very efficient because it uses electromagnetic energy instead of chemical energy. This motor is also very powerful because it can produce 15,000 horsepower in only one kilowatt of energy. The Tesla Coil Motor is also very quiet because it uses electromagnetic energy instead of chemical energy. Tesla was not only a very successful inventor, but he was also very creative. He was very creative because he created many new inventions. His inventions were used for the common good, and not for the personal profit of a few people."

LLAMA,cmv-106,"With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new technological advancements seem to be helping our environment and the way we live. I am going to explore four different new technologies that are not only making our lives easier but are also helping the environment. These four technologies include bicycle powered generators, the solar highway, 3D printers, and Google glasses. These advancements are not only helping the environment but are also helping us as a society. I am going to start with Google glasses. Google glasses are glasses that have a screen built into the glasses. The person who is wearing them can use them to make phone calls, take pictures, check the weather, get directions, and many more options. With Google glasses you can look at someone and it will pull up their information if they have a Google account. The only downside of these glasses is that they are very expensive and for that reason you can only find them on ebay. The picture below shows what they look like. The next technology that I am going to talk about is the 3D printer. A 3D printer is a printer that can make anything you put into it. You can use the 3D printer to make anything from a toothbrush to a gun. There are two types of 3D printers, the first one is the fused deposition modeling printer which is also known as the FDM. The way that this printer works is that the filament is melted and then it is forced through a nozzle which deposits the melted filament into the desired shape. The second type of 3D printer is the stereolithography printer also known as SLA. The SLA printer is built by using a vat of liquid ultraviolet curable photopolymer resin. Then the print head shines a ultraviolet light beam onto the vat which solidifies the model. The 3D printer is a great technology because it can be used in so many different fields. For example a person who is missing a leg could have a 3D printer make them a leg and then the person would not have to spend as much money on a prosthetic leg. The picture below is an example of a 3D printer in use. The next technology is the solar highway. The solar highway is a road that has solar panels built into it. The reason for this road is so that the road can generate power for the state. This is a great idea because most roads are used all day and all night so the road is always producing energy. This is a great way to help our environment because it is going to help produce clean energy which will then be used by the state. The picture below shows a solar highway. The last technology that I am going to talk about is the bicycle powered generator. The bicycle powered generator is a bicycle that is connected to a generator. The way that it works is that as the person rides the bicycle the generator uses the energy that the person is producing to create energy for other things. I saw this bike in use at the aquarium on a field trip. It was amazing to see the bike in use. The picture below shows the bike. I think that all of these technologies are great ways to help our environment and society. These technologies are also helping our environment because all of them are creating clean energy. I hope that all of these technologies become more popular in the future and that they are able to help our environment."

We are all who we make ourselves and in my own opinion our happiness is tied directly there...but that doesn't mean people can take advantage! If you read some articles about what makes someone an INTJ - they will almost always say something along these lines: ""We practice detachment."" That sounds nice if your partner was only doing whatever because heshe wanted attention from others - not true for me at least; being extroverted has nothing do wth wanting affectionate acknowledgement- so technically speaking anyone could be lying through their teeth saying ""we want love"" just as easily.. It seems like maybe its more than friendships which have changed? Because even when times were good before quarantine...there weren' t any lies involved here- neither one mentioned anything romantic until after lockdown started..... ten months ago!!

PaLM,cmv-107,"I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by telling them that I think they're wrong about something. I think it's important to be respectful of other people's opinions, even if we don't agree with them. We can disagree without being disagreeable. I think there are a few things to consider when deciding whether or not to tell someone that you think they're wrong. First, you need to think about how important the issue is to you. If it's something that you feel strongly about, then it might be worth it to have a conversation about it. However, if it's something that you don't really care about, then it might not be worth the potential conflict. Second, you need to think about how the other person is likely to react. If they're likely to be defensive or argumentative, then it might be better to avoid the conversation altogether. However, if they're open to hearing your opinion, then it might be worth having a discussion. Finally, you need to think about the potential consequences of telling the other person that you think they're wrong. If you're worried that it might damage your relationship, then it might be better to keep your opinion to yourself. However, if you're confident that you can have a productive conversation without damaging the relationship, then it might be worth it to speak up. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to tell someone that you think they're wrong is a personal one. There is no right or wrong answer. However, by considering the factors above, you can make an informed decision that is best for you and the other person. Here are some tips for having a productive conversation about a disagreement:  Be respectful of the other person's opinion. Even if you don't agree with them, it's important to listen to what they have to say.  Be clear and concise about your own opinion. Explain why you think the other person is wrong, and be prepared to defend your position.  Be open to hearing the other person's perspective. Even if you don't agree with them, it's important to try to understand where they're coming from.  Be willing to compromise. If you can't find a solution that you both agree on, then be willing to compromise. This doesn't mean that you have to give up your beliefs, but it does mean that you're willing to meet the other person halfway. Having a difficult conversation can be challenging, but it's important to remember that it's possible to disagree without being disagreeable. By following these tips, you can have a productive conversation that leaves both parties feeling respected and heard."

Being vocal about my views could potentially cut off half of all people from even giving me the chance of meeting them and potentially being friends with them just because of my political views. I know a lot of people I consider friends that have political views that I don't agree with at all, and I don't know if letting everyone know how I feel about these situations is worth ruining that. I have also heard quotes about how doingsaying nothing is worse than being against it, and that during the civil rights movement most people were silent which was definitely a bad thing, but I'm not sure if it's worth speaking up.

Tsinghua,cmv-107,"I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by sending the wrong message. It's just that, on a good day, the possibilities of what I can send mean so much more than on a bad day. That's why I'm so conflicted about what I should do. If I send it, I'm sure he'll be angry, and if he's angry, it will probably mean he doesn't want to be friends anymore. On the other hand, if I don't send it, I will be happy to be friends, but he will be mad, and I'll feel bad about it. What should I do? You should not send it. I don't think you can put into words the difference between a good day and a bad day. I think that there are just some days when you feel like you can't handle the world. There are times when you feel so bad that you're in tears. And when you're in those times, it is a very difficult thing to communicate. I think that you are very wise not to communicate. I think that you should just accept that you're having a bad day, and that's all. You don't need to tell him that you're having a bad day. Just try to understand that that is the case. I think that if you don't say anything, then that's what he will get. I think that if you tell him that you're having a bad day, he will be angry, and he will be angry, and he will not want to be friends anymore. I think that's a terrible thing to say. I think that you should just let it go. You can't make people feel better. I think that you have to let it go. I think that you have to realize that this is not a person that you can control.

LLAMA,cmv-107,"I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by telling them they're wrong. It's much easier to just not get involved with people who have political beliefs that are so different from yours than it is to try and convince them that they're wrong. Politics is a topic that should not be discussed on the internet. Which is why I rarely do it. In the same vein, I also try to avoid it in public. It's one of the reasons I avoid talking to random people on the internet. Too much risk, not enough reward. I think it was Paul Simon that said, ""Discussions lead to conclusions... conclusions lead to divisions between friends."" I think it's important to stand up for what you believe in, but there are certainly people who can't talk about politics without being rude and obnoxious. I would also add that I find it funny that conservatives are usually seen as the ""uptight"" and ""close-minded"" ones, yet I've found it to be the opposite. I've had more political discussions with liberals that have led to name calling, insults, and just being flat out rude. I agree with this. I know some people whose politics are so different from mine that I don't talk to them about politics, but we're still friends. I'm not saying politics is the only topic to avoid, just one that should be avoided. I think a lot of people take politics way too personally. I've never understood that. There is nothing personal about politics. It's not like anyone chooses their political beliefs. Politics is a taboo subject that has ruined many friendships. There's no point arguing with each other, because no one is going to change their mind. I think it's important to stand up for what you believe in, but there are certainly people who can't talk about politics without being rude and obnoxious. I agree.

I've had a few friendships ruined by political discussions. It's a subject that's best avoided. I really hate arguing about politics. There's no point arguing with each other, because no one is going to change their mind. Yeah, that's why I don't talk about politics online.

LLAMA,cmv-108,"The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. Professor Weinberg has eloquently expressed my sentiments. Of course, he says he can't prove it's true, just as I can't prove that there are no gods. It's just that he's obviously thought about it a great deal. We're talking about religion, not ""religious people."" Religious people are people, and people are people; you can't say anything about a group of people because of the group. Atheists are people too; some of us are good, and some of us are not so good. The difference is that atheists don't have an institutionalized belief system that says it's okay to do evil things in the name of God. Atheism is simply not believing in God. There is no atheist religion. As the quote points out, there are good people who do good things and bad people who do bad things. There are also good people who do bad things in the name of their religion. That's the problem with religion. Labels: atheism, atheists, religion, Steven Weinberg They said it better than I ever could, so I'll just quote them: Gay marriage ruling by judge panned by critics SAN FRANCISCO - Gay marriage opponents on Thursday accused a federal judge who overturned California's same-sex marriage ban of misconduct for saying he was bound by precedents of the most discriminatory appellate court in the nation. U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional last week, made the comments at a 2001 bar association meeting, according to an audiotape of the event. Walker said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was the most discriminatory circuit in the country and was biased against conservative viewpoints. Walker made the comments when he was in private practice and was considering whether to apply for an open position on the 9th Circuit. The circuit is the last stop for many cases before they reach the U.S. Supreme Court. In a tape of the event, Walker said he was troubled by the fact that the circuit ""is generally considered to be the most liberal court in the country and most likely to be overturned by the United States Supreme Court."" ""That's a concern to me,"" he said. Earlier this week, Walker announced he was retiring from the bench at the end of February. It's not uncommon for judges to retire in late winter or early spring, when their caseload slows. Walker said nothing about the timing of his decision in his announcement to the court. But some marriage foes said it appeared that he had decided to take a job that would require him to severely limit the number of cases he could hear. ""This is the strongest evidence yet that Judge Walker wants to become a full-time gay activist and is no longer interested in being a federal judge,"" said Brian Brown, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage. That's right. The National Organization for Marriage is against marriage. (How else can you interpret the fact that they are against gay marriage?) It's all part of a pattern of lies, misinformation, and distortion by the anti-gay marriage crowd. You can read about it [here] .

PaLM,cmv-108,"Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things, and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. -- Steven Weinberg The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg#Religion_is_an_insult_to_human_dignity). Weinberg's quote is a powerful indictment of religion. He argues that religion is not necessary for good people to do good things, but it is necessary for good people to do evil things. This is because religion provides a justification for evil actions, such as violence and oppression. Weinberg's quote is particularly relevant in today's world, where religious extremism is on the rise. Religious extremists use their faith to justify violence against those who they believe are infidels. This has led to countless atrocities, such as the 9/11 attacks and the genocide in Rwanda. Weinberg's quote is a reminder that religion is not always a force for good. In fact, it can be used to justify evil actions. This is why it is important to be critical of religion and to challenge its claims. Weinberg's quote is also a reminder that good people do not need religion to be good. In fact, many of the world's greatest humanitarians have been atheists. This shows that it is possible to be moral and ethical without religion.

With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood? First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well. What I can't understand is the last sentence: But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. He seems to be saying that only religion can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things. For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families. Poverty can make good people do evil things. Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit. Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words? A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion. An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. In order to CMV, please: convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things. show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg. show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course). anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

BigScience,cmv-108,"The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and bad people doing evil things, but with religion the thing that happens when a person knows what he's supposed to do, and does not follow through on his religious duties, then that's really, truly a threat to society. I'd like to think we've all seen enough of this in our own time - whether it's abortion rights being pushed aside for religious reasons by politicians who are unwilling to compromise their beliefs (see last week) or anti-gay laws passed so that parents cannot enroll their children at gay-straight allies schools (see here). There seems to be no end to how far evangelical Christians will go against those they deem ""transgressors"" of God's commands when it comes to their belief system. In recent weeks there has been news stories about some churches staged protests outside various stores where LGBT-themed merchandise was sold. According to Fox News, some Christian protesters had gathered around a storefront which sells Rainbow Pride t-shirts. (Which ironically were also billed as ""happy birthday gifts! It appears these protesters believed every shirt displayed at the store represented sinful behavior - even if said shirt only showed the outline of rainbows! Isn't it odd that such an organization thinks each individual member should act according to their conscience? And why doesn't a church take issue with someone displaying objectively offensive images? Many conservatives seem to be offended by any displays advocating equality between individuals regardless of race, gender identity or sexual orientation...but because Christianity says one man loves another - you're allowed to stand your ground and defend yourself if attacked? For example, many Americans support legislation requiring the government to allow same-sex marriage (Durbin's bill), yet many professing Christian leaders refused to let Durbin pass Congress' floor despite overwhelming public opinion supporting him. (One example: The American Bible Society.) While I don't have much experience living in Israel, I've met numerous Jewish women who find themselves continually harassed simply for going out dressed in jeans - wearing makeup etc. They say their husbands make them feel uncomfortable day after day just for trying something different than usual just because she won't wear her best dresses once in awhile... Why can't Jews get along with other peoples' ideas? Why must Arabs always insist that everything Arab looks better than anything Jewish? (By the way ... I have never heard anyone complain about women dressing up in inappropriate clothing while driving cars....maybe ice skates?)

With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. We don't want to live in a world where we have to be afraid of each other. We don't want to live in a world where we have to protect each other. We want to live in a world where we can be free to pursue our own happiness. But we can't do that if we're all afraid of each other. We can't do that if we're all looking over our shoulders and watching each other. And the way to do that is with a religion that tells people to be afraid of everybody else. If you tell people that they're better than other people, then they'll do better than other people. If you tell people that they're worse than other people, then they'll do worse than other people. The first is not a very good way of organizing a society, and the second is not a very good way of organizing a society. We need a different kind of society. We need a society where we trust each other. And we can't do that if we have a religion that tells us that some people are more trustworthy than others. (Source) Here's the full quote from Steven Weinberg on religion, as quoted by him at his blog: Religion is a good example of how to take a social invention and turn it into a bad idea. It's not that religion has no useful social functions, but it also has lots of functions that make people do bad things. It encourages people to be afraid of each other. It encourages people to have a special relationship with God, which encourages them to think of other people as not really human. And it teaches that there is a special class of people that are inherently good and who deserve special privileges. There is a long list of examples of how religion encourages people to do bad things, but I'll just mention one: it teaches people to hate people who don't believe in the same thing. And that's exactly the kind of thing that leads to wars and mass murders. There are good people who believe in religions, and there are bad people who believe in religions. But there is a big difference between them. There is a big difference between good people who do good things and bad people who do bad things. And there is a big difference between good people who do evil things and bad people who do evil things. The first is not a very good way of organizing a society, and the second is not a very good way of organizing a society. We need a different kind of society. We need a society where we trust each other. And we can't do that if we have a religion that tells us that some people are more trustworthy than others. (Source) There are, of course, many examples of the negative effects of religion, as is so often the case with religion. I will leave you with this: In the mid-1970s, as the United States experienced a surge of new converts, the Church of Scientology sought to become the largest church in the country. A top-secret Scientologist handbook lists a number of strategies to achieve this goal. One strategy is to plant negative stories about other religions in the media. A well-known example is the notorious anti-Mormon film, The Messiah, which portrays the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a cult. A strategy to plant negative stories about other religions in the media. Another strategy is to organize anti-religious events and create websites that vilify other religions. For example, a 2003 Los Angeles Times article reported that the Church of Scientology regularly organizes anti-religious rallies, and in 2007, the church hosted a rally against a New York City film festival that featured The Satanic Temple. The Church of Scientology was also behind a 2014 bill that would have criminalized atheism in the state of California. A strategy to organize anti-religious events and create websites that vilify other religions. Finally, there is the practice of using religious leaders to vilify other religions. For example, the Church of Scientology has paid for advertisements in newspapers attacking other religions, including Mormonism, Islam, and Judaism. It has also hired lawyers to argue in court that a religious belief can be banned in public school."

PaLM,cmv-109,"First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. You could offer her your seat, but you don't have to. You could also just sit there and do nothing. In either case, you're not breaking any laws. But what if you decide to stand up and give your seat to the elderly woman? In that case, you're not only doing something nice, you're also upholding the law. The law says that we should treat each other with respect, and that includes helping those who are less fortunate than ourselves. So, the next time you see an elderly woman on the bus, don't just think about whether or not you should give her your seat. Think about the law, and do what you know is right. Here are some other examples of how the law can encourage us to be kind to others:  The law against discrimination prevents us from treating people differently based on their race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. This law helps to create a more inclusive society, where everyone feels welcome and respected.  The law against littering encourages us to keep our communities clean and tidy. This law helps to create a more pleasant environment for everyone, and it also helps to protect the environment.  The law against speeding encourages us to drive safely. This law helps to prevent accidents, which can save lives and prevent injuries. These are just a few examples of how the law can encourage us to be kind to others. By following the law, we can create a more just and compassionate society. Of course, the law isn't always perfect. Sometimes, the law can actually discourage us from being kind to others. For example, the law against drug use can make it difficult for people to get the help they need for addiction. The law against prostitution can make it difficult for people to escape from abusive relationships. These are complex issues, and there are no easy answers. But we should always be mindful of the ways in which the law can impact our ability to be kind to others. We should work to reform the law whenever it is necessary to create a more just and compassionate society. In the end, the law is just a tool. It can be used to promote kindness, or it can be used to discourage it. We have the power to decide how the law is used. Let's use it to create a better world."
BigScience,cmv-109,"First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The driver slaps you around for not buckling up and snoring loudly even though you're not getting enough sleep. You're annoyed at being treated as if you've done something wrong; what's more, he's a jerk who doesn't listen to his passengers. So naturally you'd take action against him. You might go directly to police or call ambulance services but there's no guarantee that he'll be taken seriously unless it's clear there was some sort of physical assault. What's worse is that many drivers are afraid they won't receive proper punishment should mishandled their patients; remember this guy? A case like yours would rise quickly into public discussion and become part of news reports. What happens then? Well... In theory it could have serious consequences - your lawyer may advise filing criminal charges against the doctor (he has now been forced out) although such cases usually end with settlements between parties involved rather than primary legal sanction. However, both sides can still make use of such incident for political purposes. In our first example we're talking about an individual's personal safety while driving. But imagine a group of people were to get sick from food poisoning due to poor hygiene after attending a party given by a politician, CEO of a large corporation, etc. What do we see here? An ethical dilemma arising within the context of professionalism where one person's actions negatively affect another party's well-being. Even professional medical care may involve moral decisions which stem from previous experiences or beliefs. Aside: If bad medical care had happened before, perhaps doctors started thinking twice before performing certain procedures because they knew they'd be sued later if things went badly wrong with those clients. This became known as ""duty of conscience."" Nevertheless, healthcare providers keep ignoring these responsibilities until cases grew darker, complicated, and expensive. This logic works quite well for lawyers too! The psychological aspect of this: many professionals often feel like they're alone during the decision-making process as their colleagues don't share experience, knowledge, nor values. On top of that, some specialists try turning away from 'punitive' measures arguing 'it's better to prevent troubles than fix them'. Some argue health care costs need to come down despite higher fees, others believe it's necessary to protect consumers and retain trust without reducing quality of care. As long as experts aren't able to cultivate value-based dialogue among themselves, tough decisions will simply remain unaddressed. Let's say someone gets injured in traffic accident but can't afford a car so he needs to walk home after surgery. Maybe that's why nurses or other helpers tend to sneak off duty early or leave work late due to lack of weekends available. Or maybe parents bring kids back home instead of asking relatives or neighbors to help. These examples describe how extra expenses sometimes have nothing to do with good economic sense but arise purely out of 'cultural norms'; however, problems continue unresolved and nobody knows what to do next except wait for accidents to happen again. I know you're probably wondering: ""what does cultural awareness mean?!"" We already talked about gender issues above, right? Cultural diversity is regarded as one of the most important aspects of modern society yet physicians never really pay attention to it: while discussing patient treatment options, we pretty much act as if each person lives a story of perfect self-discipline. That's exactly why cultures differ significantly in terms of family relationships, social interactions, etiquette, financial habits, holidays traditions, linguistic rules, etc., yet all of us live under similar conditions. Do I need to explain why those differences matter to healthcare workers? Why every state, school system, university must account for different culture backgrounds (including overweight rates)? Okay, let's look deeper into the issue once again. Perhaps you think we've started becoming cynical to medical textbooks because they omit references to specific countries living standards, income levels, prices, transportation systems, education levelsquality of life, etc. And sure, everyone looks up statistics online whenever possible. Still, medical schools only admit students based upon standardized tests scores regardless of whether future graduates want to practice medicine abroad or stay local. Furthermore, some chemical processes involving drug production require strict adherence to environmental regulations and associated costs definitely influence clinical outcomes. After all, contaminated materials or chemicals used in hospitals can harm staff members andor patients and lead to major complications unlike accidental spillage of medicines accidentally left on the tabletop or dropped during procedure. Besides, attempts to improve public sanitation led to organization of national campaigns to reduce water pollution, air pollution, disease transmission vectors prevalence, etc. Not surprisingly, standards were set accordingly having positive impact on healthcare sector efficiency worldwide."

As a helpful assistant, I understand your concern. It is generally considered courteous and respectful to offer your seat to elderly people, pregnant women, or individuals with disabilities when riding on public transportation, as they may have difficulty standing for long periods of time. While this may not be a legal requirement in all countries, it is a common social convention that promotes kindness and consideration towards others.

Human,cmv-109,"First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do. This short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was ""legal,"" and therefore it should be alright. The death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral. Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered ""professional"" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen. I think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as ""moral compass"": immoral behavior. Secondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules. Thirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit. I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You're the only one who can stop a group of terrorists holding hostages. How many people would you save? Imagine you're a superhero and you're standing in a forest. You see a group of people heading down the path to where a tree has fallen. If you don't do anything, the tree will fall on the people. You can easily save them all. Do you do it? Now for a trickier one. You're a superhero and you're standing in a forest. You see a group of people heading down the path to where a tree has fallen. If you don't do anything, the tree will fall on the people. You can easily save some of them, but not all of them. Do you do it? What makes the last one more interesting is the fact that you're faced with a choice. You know you can't save all of them, but you can save some of them. It makes you ask yourself which one you'd save and which one you'd let die. What makes this scenario more realistic is the fact that we have to make this decision everyday. We can't save everyone. We can't help everyone. But we have to choose who we do save and who we don't. For example, when someone is in need, how do you choose who to help? Do you help the person who needs it the least? Or do you help the person who needs it the most? Do you help the person who is going to die without your help, or do you help the person who is going to live without your help? The problem is, if you help the person who needs it the most, then you are leaving someone who needs it less to die. If you help the person who is going to die without your help, then you are leaving someone who is going to live to die. I think that most people would choose to help the person who needs it the most and who is going to die without their help. This is because, on a subconscious level, they are saving more people. If they help the person who is going to die, they are saving one person. If they help the person who is going to live, they are saving zero people. If they help the person who needs it the least, they are saving one person. If they help the person who needs it the most, they are saving more people. This is why some people try to help everyone. They want to help as many people as possible. But is this always the right thing to do? I think that, in the end, it's all about compromise. If you help the person who needs it the most, you are saving them and everyone who needs it less than they do, but you are leaving the person who needs it more to die. If you help the person who is going to die without your help, you are saving them and everyone who needs it less than they do, but you are leaving the person who needs it more to die. If you help the person who needs it the least, you are saving them and everyone who needs it more than they do, but you are leaving the person who needs it the most to die. And if you help the person who is going to live without your help, you are saving them and everyone who needs it less than they do, but you are leaving the person who needs it more to die. There is no right answer. You have to choose. But whatever you choose, the important thing is that you know why you're making that choice. Because you will have to live with that choice.

But, even still, I'm still not sure why it's so important to some people to make sure that women are ALWAYS paid the same as men, or to make sure that women are able to ""choose"" who they can date. I'm completely sure that I'm not the only guy who feels this way, but there's no way I'm going to tell my girlfriend that she's wrong about this.

And you don't have to make it about gender. There are lots of different ways to have a ""normal conversation"" about such things. I think a conversation about equal pay is a great place to start. cm2187 I guess it's an echo of the high profile resignation of the woman who made a series of derogatory comments about the first lady in the republican primary campaign. It's been a long time since a politician from a major party (with his name on the ballot) was attacked for his wife, and that was not only on the republican side. I think the republican party has learned the lesson. I also think this article is just sensationalist. The reason for this article is to get people talking about it and talk about the issue, not to promote a single position. shoo It's a little off-topic, but if you're interested in gender issues, check out the work of Jean Twenge.

She makes a number of interesting points, and while I haven't read it in its entirety, I have found it very thought-provoking. programminggeek I don't see how anyone could argue with this article. It's so simple. The only problem is the fact that it's so obvious. I have been in a couple of these situations, and I have to say I think it's one of the most powerful feelings a man can experience. It's so nice to be respected and to know that you are a valuable person.

I'm worried about my partner not liking me anymore, but I don't know what to do about it. I'm not a woman and I don't understand what a woman feels. This article is just asking me to trust that my partner will see things my way.

I think it's important to be able to have open and honest conversations about these things, even if we don't always agree. Here are some of the things I agree with about feminism:  Women should have equal rights to men. This means that women should be able to vote, own property, work, and have the same opportunities as men. It also means that women should be protected from discrimination and violence.  Women should be able to make choices about their own bodies. This includes the right to have an abortion, access to contraception, and the right to make decisions about their own reproductive health.  Women should be able to express themselves freely. This means that women should be able to wear what they want, say what they want, and pursue the careers they want without being judged or harassed.

I'm currently dating a girl who is a self-identified ""feminist,"" which seems interesting since she's also not really into politics or anything like that (so it doesn't seem to be an identity imposed on her by someone else). In fact we have very different political views: She supports Israel while my socialist leanings suggest otherwise; Her idea for how men should treat women in relationships sounds good except when you consider all sides - there are lots more people living now than were alive at any given time before modern medicine made this possible so perhaps they can improve their lives without having children? The point being... It may simply come down as one person believing something true because everyone around him says its okay versus another belief held just cause he likes what those saying believes about stuff!

Human,cmv-110,"I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There's really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach. When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said ""Ugh, I hate Peach, she's such a weak and stereotypical female video game character."" To which I jokingly replied ""Wow, that's a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she's obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her."" And her response to that was ""Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario."" Then I made the mistake of saying ""Well I don't think that's true."" We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life. There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don't need no man: Samus, Rosalina, ZeldaSheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it's still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn't be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal. The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They're imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked] . Most reasonable people realize that women don't wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtledinosaur hybrid. I provided my argument, and also said if Mario's and Peach's roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was ""You won't ever understand because you're a guy."" I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: ""You won't ever understand because you're a guy."" So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I'm more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video gamesstories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than ""It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt"" Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

It's a bit more than what you're probably thinking. Why would you assume that? My mom is a feminist, and she taught me that men and women should have equal rights. That's why I don't like how feminism is portrayed in the media. Some feminists believe men and women are inherently different, and that women are better at some things than men.

Tsinghua,cmv-111,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But the situation is even worse than it seems, because there's no information about how many employees actually take leave or how much time is taken, and that information is confidential. So, if you are an employer, I think you have a lot of questions to ask yourself. Are you doing a good job of helping your employees with their child's health care? How do you help them plan for that? Are you having a conversation about their plans? Is there a benefit that you can offer them, maybe for being able to work from home? You can offer flexible hours. Are you communicating to them about the importance of being at work? There's a lot of things you can do. I'm not sure that this is a political issue, but I do think it's a human issue, and that is the situation that we have in the U.S. The other thing that I would say is that, if you're an employer, you can use the same framework that you're using for diversity and inclusion to help you get more insight into the ways in which women and men are different. You can use that same approach to help you understand the impact that paternity leave might have on your workforce. It's going to take some time, but I think it's something that employers can do to help themselves and to help their employees. Emily Rodman: I think that the question about communication, I would just add, because I think that it's also really important to understand the difference between the different types of communication that an employer can use. There are three things that we've talked about: the basic kind of communication that you're doing now, but you're using a more inclusive language; then there's the additional communication that you're doing, that you're using inclusive language, and then there's the type of communication that is more strategic, that's kind of more high-level, that's kind of more symbolic, that you might use if you're really thinking about how this is going to impact your workforce. And, again, I think there's a lot of value in doing that kind of communication. I would also just add, I think, that one of the really interesting things that we've seen in our research is that men are actually very interested in these conversations. And, really, the fact that we're having this conversation at all is really important. But, I think that it's also really important for women to know that there are men who are going to be supportive of this, and that there are men who are going to be supportive of what you're trying to do, and that's one of the things that we've seen is that men have a lot of good ideas for how to make this happen. Emily Rodman: So, if you're an employer and you're thinking about how you can make this happen, there are a couple of different things that you could do. You could create a maternity leave plan that you can share with employees. You could make sure that the plan is being communicated to employees. You could create a support system for employees who are taking leave, or you could create a program where you're allowing employees to take leave, and then they can take a leave of absence from their job. One of the things that we've found is that the best approach is to create a program that's flexible enough that you can actually help people with their health care. If you're going to offer a paid leave, then it's very important that you understand that you're not just giving them time off from work, you're giving them time off from their health care, too. And, really, if you want to support people in taking time off, you've got to help them make sure that they're getting the right care. And, I think that there's also a lot of value in doing that, in making sure that you're helping people to transition back into their job, because they're going to be doing a lot of the work that they were doing before they took the leave. And, really, it's going to take some time, and you can't really expect them to just come back to work and do the same work. So, I think that there's a lot of value in really understanding the needs of the people who are taking leave, and making sure that they're supported and understood and cared for. Emily Rodman: And, I think that's really important, because, as you know, one of the challenges that women face is that there's so much of the responsibility for raising the kids."
BigScience,cmv-111,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But secondly, what does it mean to be a family-friendly employer? For so long in corporate America, people have thought about their job as just another cog in the wheel - something they do because they're paid for doing it. Well, there needs to be more discussion around how we can actually build an environment within our own industry which values those families who are trying to balance work with parenting. (Applause.)"
LLAMA,cmv-111,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But, as it stands now, I believe that many companies still tend to look at maternity leave more favorably than paternity leave, simply because it's the mother who is actually carrying the child for nine months, giving birth, and breastfeeding. As much as I believe that there should be equal leave granted to both parents, I'm guessing this just isn't going to happen in the foreseeable future. However, I think it's a mistake to assume that, because paternity leave isn't granted in all cases, that it's not a good idea for a male attorney to even ask for it. I'm sure it depends upon the culture of the firm, but I would suggest that most employers would be very sympathetic to a male attorney who genuinely wants to spend time with his family after the birth of a child. Even if the firm doesn't have an official paternity leave policy, they might be willing to give the attorney some flexibility in the days or weeks after the birth of the child. As for how to ask, I would say it's best to be upfront about it as soon as possible. The firm is going to know that the new attorney is going to need some time off, so it's best to discuss it early on. I would advise the attorney to frame the request as a way that he is trying to be an active participant in his child's upbringing and to ask that the firm consider his request for paternity leave. If the attorney is able to work out a leave that's shorter than the leave the firm might grant to a female employee, that's another good point to bring up. I would think that most firms would be happy to know that the attorney is going to be available for work earlier than a mother would be available after having a child. Of course, the best way to get a good answer to this type of question is to ask it to someone you actually know at a firm where you are interested in working. You might be able to make a great connection and even get some tips about whether or not firms in that area are willing to grant paternity leave. You definitely have to be careful about this. I know that some firms will see this as a red flag and assume that a male attorney asking for paternity leave is going to be less committed to his job than a male attorney who doesn't ask. I'm not saying that's right, but I've heard of it happening. However, I would say that this is the exception, rather than the rule. As I said above, I think most employers are going to be sympathetic to the request and may even be impressed by the male attorney's willingness to take an active role in parenting his child."
OpenAI,cmv-111,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But there are some things that can be done to help employees who need to take time off for parental reasons. One potential option is to look into any available family or medical leave programs provided by your employer or by law. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in the U.S. allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain family or medical reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child. Another option is to talk with your employer about the possibility of taking a leave of absence or using any available paid time off or vacation days. While these may not specifically be designated as maternity or paternity leave, they can still provide some financial support during this time. It may also be beneficial to communicate with your colleagues and manager about your leave plans and make sure that proper arrangements are made to ensure that your work is covered while you're away. This can help ease any concerns or stress about taking time off. Finally, it's important to remember that your health and your family's well-being are a top priority. Don't hesitate to take the time off that you need to care for yourself and your loved ones."
PaLM,cmv-111,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I also think it's important to remember that there are a lot of factors that go into creating a family-friendly workplace, and that not all employers are in a position to offer generous paid leave policies. For example, a small business owner may not be able to afford to pay their employees for weeks or months of leave, even if they would like to. And even large corporations may have to make difficult decisions about how to allocate their resources, especially in times of economic uncertainty. That's why I think it's important to have a nuanced conversation about this issue. We need to acknowledge the challenges that employers face, while also advocating for policies that make it easier for parents to take time off to care for their children. One possible solution is to provide financial assistance to employers who offer paid parental leave. This could be done through tax breaks or government subsidies. Another option would be to create a national paid parental leave program, similar to the one that exists in Canada. Of course, there are no easy answers to this issue. But I believe that we can create a more family-friendly workplace if we work together to find solutions that work for everyone. Here are some specific policies that I believe would help to make the U.S. a more family-friendly country:  Paid parental leave: All employers should be required to provide paid parental leave to their employees. This leave should be at least 12 weeks long, and it should be available to both mothers and fathers.  Childcare assistance: The government should provide financial assistance to families who need help paying for childcare. This assistance could be in the form of tax breaks, subsidies, or direct payments.  Flexible work arrangements: Employers should allow their employees to work flexible hours or from home, if possible. This can help parents to balance their work and family responsibilities.  Parenting support programs: The government should provide support programs for parents, such as parenting classes, support groups, and counseling. These programs can help parents to learn how to raise their children, and they can provide them with a source of support. I believe that these policies would help to make the U.S. a more family-friendly country, and they would make it easier for parents to raise their children."
Human,cmv-111,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are ""more focused on kids."" Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? It's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place! If paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the ""expected value"" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.

LLAMA,cmv-112,"I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt run the country. The 10k in debt was a statement against banks, who make millions and billions in interest on credit cards, which makes it more difficult for people to get out of the debt cycle. It wasn't a problem, it was a political statement. So you're saying that if you got elected, you'd use a 10000 credit card debt to make a political statement? I didn't say that. I said I wouldn't do that. Okay. So, why is it okay for him to do it, but not for you? Because he's a candidate for president and I'm not."

OpenAI,cmv-112,"I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit I understand your concern. It is true that allowing someone with a large amount of debt to run for office can potentially create conflicts of interest and raise questions about their ability to make sound financial decisions. However, it is ultimately up to the voters to decide if a candidate's financial situation is a concern for them. It's important for voters to educate themselves on a candidate's policies and experiences before making a decision at the ballot box."

I have a student with over 30,000 in credit card debt. He has some minor medical issues and a bit of depression. I have not seen him in 6 months. I think he is suicidal and I have lost hope that he will ever get out of his debt. He has no car and no place to live. He has been in debt so long, that he doesn't know how to do anything else. I have been watching him suffer and I feel helpless. I want to help him, but I don't know how. I think I have to file for bankruptcy and I am considering it. I am going to talk to him this weekend and see if he wants to talk to me. If he does, I will try to help him. If he doesn't, then I am going to do it anyway. The debt is weighing heavily on him and he is doing nothing about it. I don't know how I am going to be able to save him, but I have to try. Please pray for him. He is a good man.

PaLM,cmv-112,"I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt run for office. They are more likely to make decisions that benefit themselves and their creditors than the people they represent. For example, a politician with a lot of debt might be more likely to vote for a bill that gives tax breaks to corporations that offer credit cards, even if it means that the bill hurts the middle class. They might also be more likely to support policies that make it easier for people to get credit cards, even if it means that people end up getting into debt that they can't afford. In addition, a politician with a lot of debt might be more likely to be influenced by lobbyists from the credit card industry. These lobbyists could offer the politician money or other benefits in exchange for their support of policies that benefit the credit card industry. This could lead to the politician making decisions that are not in the best interests of the people they represent. For these reasons, I believe that it is dangerous to let someone with a lot of credit card debt run for office. They are more likely to make decisions that benefit themselves and their creditors than the people they represent."
Human,cmv-113,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea. So by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of. The worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all ""whites"" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the ""white vs black"" dichotomy. My opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it ""you"" vs ""partner,"" you have to make it ""both of you as a couple"" vs ""the problem."" So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us. Perhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion. Edit: Sorry if I reply late, having a bit of a family emergency."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-113,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. It also has negative side-effects such as the formation in people who want more power or prestige than others think they deserve (social climbers). The problem is this - if everyone forms their own little group you end up with too many different subcultures which results into some sort conflict between them all because members within these cultures tend not being able see each other perspectives clearly enough due lack thereof knowledge about how things work around there areaculture etc... Because no one keep an overview on what happens per culture it ends becoming somewhat unbalanced where certain cultural tendencies starts gaining momentum while opposing trends withers away before any critical mass could be reached allowing for proper evaluation by outsiders looking at local society from afar: ""This will never fly here."" ""We'll win out over those fools down south next election cycle....""etc.."
BigScience,cmv-113,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. But there is also the negative side: when people feel rejected or judged by group members they tend to withdraw into their own space, become more self-absorbed, less open toward others and even begin to believe in delusional conspiracies. In this paper I'd like to focus on one particular conspiracy theory - called ""Covid Conspiracy"" in my book ""The World's 100 Most Dangerous Scare Movies""; but it would be easy to pick out some other ones as well. They all seem pretty convincing nowadays, especially in light of how much we're being told about these Corona Viruses from various angles."
OpenAI,cmv-113,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. Yes, that's right. Humans have an innate need for social interaction and to be a part of a group. Being part of a group provides a sense of community, support, and belonging, helping to reduce stress and increase overall well-being. In addition, when people work together in groups, they can pool their strengths, knowledge, and resources to achieve a common goal. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency, making it easier for groups to accomplish tasks that would be more difficult for individuals to do on their own. However, it's also important to note that group dynamics can sometimes lead to negative outcomes, such as social exclusion, prejudice, conformity, and groupthink. So while being a part of a group can be beneficial, it's important to be aware of these potential drawbacks and work to foster a positive group dynamic."
LLAMA,cmv-113,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. But it also can bring about the negative aspects of group-think, discrimination against others and conflict with others. In a society that is becoming more and more diverse, and people are moving around more, how can we take advantage of the benefits of belonging to a group while avoiding the negative aspects of intolerance, discrimination and prejudice? I think you need to look at things on two levels. 1) At the individual level, we need to educate people about the benefits of being open-minded, tolerant and accepting. We need to make sure people know that the beliefs of others are not necessarily a threat to them. 2) At the group level, we need to make sure that we don't create institutions that encourage the development of closed societies that are intolerant of other groups. We need to make sure that we don't make decisions that encourage groups to form into us-vs-them environments. Although I know people who are extremely religious, I don't personally have a belief in a God, so religion and religious institutions don't hold a lot of meaning for me. But I think religious institutions have a great deal of responsibility for the intolerance and violence that occurs in the world today. I don't believe that the cause of this intolerance is due to religion itself, but to the way it is practiced. Religion has been used as a method of control and oppression for a very long time. It has been used to control people within a society, and to conquer and control other societies. It has been used to justify slavery, to justify genocide, and to justify war. Religion has been used to oppress women, to oppress minorities, and to oppress children. One of the biggest mistakes we have made as a society is to let religion be a source of discrimination. We have allowed ourselves to be oppressed and controlled by religious institutions and leaders. We have allowed ourselves to be discriminated against based on religion. We have let religion be used to justify hatred. We need to move away from these practices, and to move away from religious institutions that practice these things. We need to find a way to remove the idea of superiority of one religion over another. We need to remove the idea that some people are ""chosen"" while others are not. We need to stop using religion to justify discrimination. I am not saying that we should get rid of religion. I'm just saying that we need to be careful to make sure that religion doesn't become a source of intolerance and hatred."
Tsinghua,cmv-113,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. But in certain circumstances, we can become overly attached to our social groups, resulting in some of the negative effects such as conformity, peer pressure, stereotyping, social control and psychological isolation. While most of us will enjoy social gatherings with our friends, sometimes we can feel like the whole point of the event is to spend time with other people. As a result, we end up doing things that we don't necessarily enjoy just because we're in a group. This is a pretty common occurrence. For example, a group of friends may decide to go to a club on a Friday night, just because everyone else is going. In that situation, the reason we're all going is to spend time with each other, not necessarily to have a good time. This phenomenon can have a negative impact on our health and well-being. One study showed that people who didn't go to their annual reunions were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those who did. Another study found that college students who didn't go to their annual class reunions were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those who did. The researchers concluded that this was because students who didn't go were less likely to socialize with other people outside of the university. They were also less likely to meet new people, and were more likely to be isolated. As you can imagine, these are all negative health outcomes. When we get together with our friends, we're socializing, but we also need to be aware that we can be too social. We can end up doing things that we don't necessarily enjoy just because we're in a group. If we find ourselves getting too attached to our social groups, it's important to recognize that and work to break that attachment. We can try to set boundaries with our friends, and try to make time for other things. In other words, we can set limits on our relationships with other people. It's also important to recognize that this doesn't mean we're unlikable or don't like other people. Sometimes, we just need to put our own needs first. We may not be able to be in a group situation all the time. This is a situation where it's important to have a healthy sense of self-esteem. We have to be okay with being alone, and being happy without other people. We can't spend all of our time trying to fit in with others. We have to do what we need to do to make ourselves happy, and we can't let other people dictate that."
Human,cmv-114,"Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I either a) I don't know b) I don't like or c) I'm not friends with. Except I'm getting a lot of crap because my friends in relationships (I'm single) want to bring their partners who all fall into one of the three above categories. Why should I host people that I don't want to, and who, chances are, don't want to be there anyway? But right now my views are more important than my problems. Is it a major etiquette fuckup if you don't invite plus ones? Should I just suck it up? Change my view! Edit: Okay, view changed. Thank you reddit. I awarded deltas for those who either made me think about the consequences of any decision I choose to make, or made me consider the situation my friends are going to be in if I do say ""no plus ones.""

But because a lot can happen over two years and if you invite 50 or 100 for this milestone birthday party then some may not make an appearance again until your 30th40teh anniversary which is just silly! I have been looking at NYC venues but now everyone has their own weddings booked in 2018 2019 - eek!! So what's left? Queens still seems like too large town with high rents etc...??

BigScience,cmv-114,"Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I want invited as well. I'm having a hard time finding out how many invitations are needed and what the range is for different types of functions. A: You need at least 30 guests if you're planning on serving food (unless you have an excuse). If you're not going to serve booze or alcoholic drinks, then 60 will probably do. In terms of function type, there aren't any exact numbers but I'd say it's best to go with something traditional such as formal dinner - unless your goal is just to get together family andor friends. As far as numbers goes; For those who don't know this information from personal experience: my wife's parents got married in 1976! So wedding anniversaries often involve other relatives getting theirs too, thus increasing the number over 50 guestsparties desired. It's all relative though! If you insist on using date first method, there's two ways you'll discover the amount of people: 1) asking everyone else whether they can make the party and 2) figuring mathematically by multiplying total expected attendance times 4 for each person you'd invite. we've had parties where we planned 45-50 attendees, but were surprised when almost half showed up because some didn't hearsee us advertise- otherwise we'd never known our true capacity! A: All depends on venue. A simple brunch would likely require fewer invites while a fancy dance floor may call for slightly larger tables and more chairs. I usually throw around 250-275 depending on size of room, decorations, etc... A: There really isn't anything generalizable here. Having said that, keep three things in mind: The format of the eventdoes it include dancing? Are the adults drinking? Is your ""plus one"" list large enough to justify adding another table? (or additional chairs?) What level of intimacy does your group care about? With these factors taken into account, come up with reasonable expectations based on: How formal is the occasion? What age bracket (s)? One thing I've learned from hosting numerous weddingsthe groups tend to gravitate toward certain caterers, florists, musicians, DJs, photographers etc..."

They're being brats. i think its totally fine to not invite plus ones. you're not being an asshole. and plus one's are so overrated. yeah, I think its totally reasonable to not invite plus ones. unless you're in a relationship with someone, you shouldn't be entitled to a plus one. just explain to them that you're having a small party and only inviting close friends. Yeah it's your party, you can invite whomever you want. I don't really care for plus ones either, I mean, how well do you know them? You don't owe anyone anything.

Invite them to a different event if you want to make them happy, but they're being brats. Asshole. You are asking people to celebrate your birthday, so they should be able to bring whoever they want. It is your party, but it is also their time as well. But if you want to be a dick, go for it. You'll be the one who is still single when you're 25. I don't think it's being an asshole. You were just clear in the invitation that plus ones were not invited. People who are pissed about it are just being brats. I would never invite plus ones to a small party.

I've been trying to find a solution myself...this forum just doesn't seem like its mine anymore..like I've signed up somewhere else I don't really care too much whether or not my posts get deleted as long as they aren't spammy. But when someone deletes an entire thread because one person posts something offensive, I feel quit hurt sometimes. Why can't people take constructive criticism? This isn't the first time I've seen him do it though. His previous threads were fine until he started posting things like ""I hate you"" or ""I'm done with you now!!"" and his social media accounts got more active after that. It has made me mad!"

PaLM,cmv-115,"Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morally/ethically ""better"". If you submitted a topic to this sub with the title ""I think [insert controversial opinion here]"", people would be free to disagree with you and explain why they think your opinion is wrong. That doesn't mean that they're trying to silence you or that they don't think you're entitled to your opinion. It just means that they disagree with you and want to share their own perspective. In a free and democratic society, it's important to be able to have open and honest discussions about controversial topics. This allows us to challenge our own beliefs and come to a better understanding of the world around us. If we were only allowed to express opinions that were popular or agreed upon by everyone, we would never be able to grow as individuals or as a society. So, next time you see someone disagreeing with you on a controversial topic, don't be afraid to engage in a discussion with them. You might learn something new, and you might even change their mind. And even if you don't, at least you'll have had the opportunity to share your own perspective and to hear what others have to say. Here are some tips for having a productive discussion about a controversial topic:  Be respectful. Even if you disagree with someone, it's important to treat them with respect. This means listening to what they have to say without interrupting, and avoiding personal attacks.  Be open-minded. Be willing to consider other viewpoints, even if they're different from your own. This doesn't mean that you have to agree with them, but it does mean that you should be willing to listen to what they have to say.  Be prepared to back up your claims. If you're making a claim, be prepared to provide evidence to support it. This could include statistics, expert opinions, or personal experiences.  Be willing to change your mind. If you're presented with new evidence that challenges your beliefs, be willing to change your mind. This doesn't mean that you have to agree with the other person, but it does mean that you should be willing to consider their perspective. Remember, a good discussion is about exchanging ideas and learning from each other. It's not about winning or losing. So, next time you see someone disagreeing with you on a controversial topic, don't be afraid to engage in a discussion with them. You might just learn something new."

If you submitted a topic to this sub with the title ""I find gay people sickening. CMV"" there would be tons of replies and circle jerking about all the ways the OP was wrong. That's because, I'm assuming, enough people have decided it's morally wrong to discriminate against gay people that there will be actual dissention. If you posted a thread with the title ""Gay people deserve the same rights as straight people,"" you would get into a war of semantics and what it meant to have the ""same rights"" as another person, because not many people would be willing to argue against the base viewpoint of the post.

Tsinghua,cmv-115,"Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically ""better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with the title, ""I think X is morally wrong, why? ,"" then you are doing it wrong. Please don't do it.] I will not get into a lengthy debate over whether or not it is ""morally wrong"" to do things. But I do have some opinions. Here are a few reasons why I think you're doing it wrong: 1. There is a very simple moral question that is answered in two sentences: Do not kill. Period. This answer is simple enough that you could take a random person and explain the moral reason for not killing them, and they would understand. You're making a complex moral question out of a very simple one. 2. It's unnecessary. If you're going to try to tell people what they're doing wrong, you have to make it as simple as possible. You're saying ""It's wrong to kill,"" and that's it. The way you phrase it, you're adding a bunch of extra stuff. ""But you're wrong to kill, and you're also wrong to..."" I think you can get the idea. I also think you can get the idea that it's unnecessary to try to do that. 3. It's unfair. You're telling people what they're doing wrong, but not telling them why. I don't see how that's helpful. If I'm killing an ant, and you tell me that killing an ant is wrong, but don't tell me why, it's not going to change my mind. If you tell me why it's wrong, but don't tell me what I'm doing wrong, then I have to take you at your word. You're saying that killing an ant is wrong, and you're also saying that I'm killing an ant, so I take you at your word that killing an ant is wrong. But then you're not telling me why, so I have to guess why. And guess what? I guess wrong. I guess that it's wrong because you told me it's wrong. But I guess wrong. And you know what? If I was the one doing it, and you were the one saying it's wrong, you would say it's wrong, and I would take you at your word that it's wrong, but I would guess wrong. I would guess that you were saying it's wrong because you were the one doing it. 4. It's an insult to people who are already very good at knowing what they're doing wrong. If I go into a room, and there's a mirror there, and I kill someone, I can say, ""Hey, I killed someone. That's wrong. And I'm also killing someone, so I'm doing it wrong. But I'm doing it wrong because..."" If you're not telling people why, you're just telling them that they're doing it wrong. But you're not telling them why. That's an insult to people who already know why. You can say, ""Killing is wrong,"" and it will be fine. You can say, ""Killing is wrong because killing is bad,"" and it will be fine. But if you're not saying why, it's an insult to people who know why. 5. It's an insult to people who are already very good at knowing what they're doing wrong. If I go into a room, and there's a mirror there, and I kill someone, I can say, ""Hey, I killed someone. That's wrong. And I'm also killing someone, so I'm doing it wrong. But I'm doing it wrong because..."" If you're not telling people why, you're just telling them that they're doing it wrong. But you're not telling them why. That's an insult to people who already know why. You can say, ""Killing is wrong,"" and it will be fine. You can say, ""Killing is wrong because killing is bad,"" and it will be fine. But if you're not saying why, it's an insult to people who know why. If you are right and I am wrong, you are not doing it wrong. You are doing it right. I am doing it wrong. I don't know why. I don't even know what I am doing wrong. I am a totally different species of person. I'm a plant. Plants don't kill. I'm a mammal. Mammals don't kill. I'm a dog."
Tsinghua,cmv-116,"Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be done. I think that we should be willing to bend a bit and consider new solutions to the problem. Some of the laws we have today are a result of actions taken by governments, and I think we should consider how much of the law is being abused. I think we should also consider the fact that the situation we are in today is not entirely due to governments, but rather is the result of a mix of bad decisions made by the citizens of this country, along with the governments who decided to ignore some of those decisions. We also need to consider that we are a country of free-thinking individuals. It's not that we're all crazy. I'm not saying that we all have to agree on what is right and wrong. But we should at least be willing to consider new solutions, and we should be willing to change some of the things we think are wrong. Let me give an example of what I'm talking about. In the US, a person can own an unlicensed gun. Now, I think that this is wrong, and that the laws need to be changed. But there are some problems with this law. One of them is that the government is the one making the decision on what is and is not a ""gun."" But the problem with that is that the government does not know what the limits of a gun are. For example, the government is not the one that makes the gun safe. So the government is not the one that should be deciding if a gun is safe or not. It should be up to the person who makes the gun to decide if the gun is safe. And the government should be making sure that the guns that are sold are safe. The problem with this is that the government is trying to regulate the industry that makes guns. And we all know how well that has turned out. But I think that if we are going to change the law, we should change it in a way that does not harm the people who make guns. And that is by allowing the people who make guns to decide what is and is not a gun. If we were to change the law to allow the people who make guns to decide what is and is not a gun, we could still have a law that makes it illegal to own an unlicensed gun. But the people who make guns would be the ones making the decisions about whether or not a gun is safe. And they would be the ones making the decisions about what should be in a gun safe. And the government would be making sure that the guns that are sold are safe. The government could also do a better job of enforcing the law if it was not trying to regulate the industry that makes guns. And we could have a law that would allow us to still own guns. So I think that we should change the law so that the people who make guns are the ones making the decisions about what is and is not a gun. And we should have a law that would allow us to still own guns. And we should change the law so that the people who make guns are the ones making the decisions about what is and is not a gun.

PaLM,cmv-116,"Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be. In my opinion, the legal drinking age should be lowered to 18. There are a number of reasons for this, but the most important one is that it would allow young people to make more informed decisions about alcohol consumption. When people are under the age of 18, they are not legally allowed to drink alcohol. This means that they are not able to learn about the effects of alcohol in a safe and controlled environment. As a result, they are more likely to drink irresponsibly when they are finally able to do so. Lowering the legal drinking age would allow young people to learn about the effects of alcohol in a more controlled environment. They would be able to experiment with alcohol in a safe setting, and they would be more likely to make informed decisions about how much to drink and how often to drink. In addition, lowering the legal drinking age would help to reduce the number of underage drinking violations. When young people are not allowed to drink alcohol, they are more likely to try to get it illegally. This can lead to them getting into trouble with the law, or it can even put them in danger. Lowering the legal drinking age would also help to reduce the number of alcohol-related accidents. When young people are not allowed to drink alcohol, they are more likely to drive drunk. This can lead to serious injuries or even death. Of course, there are some people who argue that the legal drinking age should be raised, not lowered. They believe that young people are not mature enough to handle alcohol responsibly. However, I believe that the evidence shows that young people are capable of making informed decisions about alcohol consumption. In fact, a study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that young people who are allowed to drink alcohol at a younger age are more likely to drink responsibly. The study also found that young people who are allowed to drink alcohol at a younger age are less likely to develop alcohol problems later in life. I believe that the legal drinking age should be lowered to 18. This would allow young people to make more informed decisions about alcohol consumption, it would reduce the number of underage drinking violations, and it would help to reduce the number of alcohol-related accidents."
LLAMA,cmv-116,"Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be the law. I think that if you have a driving license, you should be allowed to drive with some level of intoxication. I'm not suggesting that the limit should be 0.4 or something crazy like that. I'm suggesting that the limit should be 0.03 or 0.04, which would be in line with many European countries. Here's why I think this is a reasonable idea: First, the studies that are cited as proof that BAC levels as low as 0.05 cause an increase in accidents are not all that convincing, and they are certainly not proof. As I understand it, the problem with these studies is that they have lots of confounding factors that can't be controlled for. For example, it is true that people who get into accidents tend to have a higher BAC. But that's because if you have an accident, the police are more likely to test you for BAC, so that's not proof that the BAC was the cause of the accident. Second, I don't think that a BAC of 0.05 is particularly impairing. I used to drink a lot, and at that level I would definitely know that I was drunk. But I was able to function pretty well. Third, it's not true that the risk of an accident increases with a higher BAC, even within the range of 0.0 to 0.1. So the risk of an accident with a BAC of 0.08 is lower than the risk of an accident with a BAC of 0.1. Now, that doesn't prove that a BAC of 0.08 is safe, but it does prove that BAC isn't a linear relationship. So the idea that any level of intoxication is an increase in risk doesn't seem correct to me. So, I think that the BAC level should be 0.03 or 0.04. I don't think that 0.00 is reasonable. People should be allowed to have some level of intoxication and still be allowed to drive. Sarah E. Mar 22, 2017 The most important thing for me when I was younger was to be able to drive home. In my experience, the vast majority of 16-18 year olds don't have a good sense of when they've had too much to drive and I would rather not get a call from my child that they've been in an accident than worry about them trying to walk home in the dark. I'm in the UK, though, so it's a bit different. I agree with you that the studies are not that convincing. However, the problem is that there are no good ways to study this sort of thing. Here's a thought experiment. Suppose that some new medication comes along, and some people take it, and some people don't. You suspect that this medication might cause cancer. What do you do? Well, you'd like to do a study, where you randomly assign people to a control group, and a group taking the medication. But that's not ethical. So you're stuck with doing the best you can with non-experimental data. There's a similar problem with this issue. We can't randomly assign people to drive drunk or not. So we're stuck with non-experimental data. That's not good, but it's the best we have. These are very difficult issues. I'm not saying that the current laws are wrong. I'm saying that they could be more liberal. I agree with you that it's a bit different in the UK, because you can get a taxi pretty easily. But even in the UK, the limit is 0.08 I think that as long as there are drivers who are drunk and who can cause accidents, that it is necessary to have some level of enforcement of drunk driving laws. I would like to see some sort of breathalyzer in cars, so that drunk drivers can't start their cars. But I think that the law should allow for some level of intoxication. I think the limit should be 0.03 or 0.04. I think you're right that the studies are hard to do. And I think that they are hard to interpret. They say that they are doing regression analysis, and they're controlling"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-116,"Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be done afterwards - whether it's right for a person who used drugs illegally (with no intent) before they were legalized in their countrystate and would have been illegal under continued prohibition laws all along... I don't believe there are any ""absolute"" moral truths on drug use unless you can define an absolute meaning from where we're currently standing without using other concepts like evolution which was part parcel with our evolutionary process that brought us here at present day so thus making every human being has absolutely evolved since birth as species.. And even then many things still aren't understood yet such how these same aspects evolve over time...so maybe morality will change one more great step forward after reaching another level too!? haha Or perhaps some few individuals may never reach said levels instead hanging onto archaic ideals based only upon limited knowledge until technology progresses further into whatever direction.... But regardless none-the less something major changes eventually always does when enough events occur together by chance tipping points across different areas because everything functions within its own ecosystem; nothing exists outside itself but rather connected through symbiotic relationships.) So let me explain my position:"
Human,cmv-116,"Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be the case. Here's my logic: 1. Roads exist for the purpose of people getting around, not specifically for cars. The whole idea of ""jaywalking"" was a PR campaign put on by auto-makers. [Here's an article] that explains a bit about the PR campaign towards ""roads are for cars."" 2. People in cities (myself included), use a bicycle as their primary commuter vehicle and means to get around the city. 3. Safety: Sometimes road conditions aren't safe for cyclists. If a car hits a bike, things are generally much much worse for the bike, so cyclists need the ability to ride safely. If there's a pothole, they need to be able to swerve, or to stop in a place where they have visibility, etc. EDIT: removing this. Multiple people have pointed out that it is legal to carefully avoid hazards in the road, so this isn't really relevant and is distracting from my main point, which is 4 4. Convenience is critical. Coming to a full stop at a stop sign, staying behind a stopped car (e.g. not lane splitting), and not being able to ride through crosswalks seriously impede the flow of bicycle traffic and make it take longer to get anywhere. The only reason we can ever justify driving 60 mph on a highway is for speed and convenience, and it matters just as much for cyclists as it does for drivers. In fact, for cyclists, at least they are only likely to kill themselves in an accident, where highway speed vehicles can take out other people. 5. More people biking is better for public health and the environment, and therefore should be encouraged, and following every car law discourages this 6. This is the weakest of all of the arguments, but people already aren't following some of these laws, because they deem the laws to be overly harsh. Having a set of laws more tailored for bicycles, or just granting certain exceptions to them, might encourage people to follow some of the laws that are really important, like passing on the left when a car may be turning right. I realize this is a bit of a cop-out, but I'm not specifying exactly what I think the laws should be, or how they should be applied. But it is my view that current road laws for cars should not apply to bicycles. I'm limiting this view to cities because it's the environment I'm most familiar with, and because cars are generally traveling faster and are less likely to expect bicycles outside the city. Also, transportation by bicycle may be less realistic when people have to travel further distances. EDIT: clarifications: The numbered points above are points of logic, they aren't each meant to individually address the CMV I'm not saying bicycles should have absolutely no rules laws at all, just that they shouldn't have to follow rules created for cars There's a trade-off between safety and speed (or convenience) in every form of transportation. Driving at highway speeds is insanely deadly and dangerous, but we tolerate it because it lets us travel further, faster. I'm just trying to apply a bit of that same logic to bicycles, allowing them to get ahead of traffic, not fully stop at stop signs, etc. Sure it's a bit less safe, but still potentially safer than commuting via car (not sure, would be interesting to look up some numbers on this). EDIT: more clarifications: I realize that existing laws provide good safety for bicycles (which is why I crossed out 3 above). I think the laws are too safe compared to the level of safety we expect from driving a car. People are accusing me of soap boxing because their repetitive arguments aren't convincing me. OK. I might be wrong, but I think that the laws aren't good. Try to convince me they are. Or don't. Your time is your own. I don't think I've been dismissive of anyones view or arguments, if you think I have, please point an example, because I don't want to come across this way. Since people keep repeating arguments, I want to address the top 3 here: 1. ""you're on our road, follow our rules."" This is a non-argument. Yes, I understand the current laws. There is nothing holy about them, as in my jaywalking example above, they have changed before. As the use of roads is shifting again (towards more bicycles, for example), so should the laws. 2. ""The laws are for your own safety"" This is addressed above. I think they are too safe. It would be safer to never drive more than 20mph, but we don't do that 3. ""You should be predictable to other drivers."" This is actually a good argument, but I think if there were some consistent set of rules for cyclists to follow and drivers were educated about those rules, we could achieve a good level of safety and a good compromise with speed and convince. EDIT: my view was (mostly) changed. [Here's the full comment] . Basically I was thinking about competent and aware cyclists who are commuting daily in a city, but I failed to consider the thousands of tourists and new cyclists and people who just don't know what they're doing. Requiring everyone to follow existing laws saves those people"
Tsinghua,cmv-117,"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They help you to stay alert on your bike. You might get into a situation where you need to react quickly, and a helmet helps you to do that. They help you stay safe, because they offer a greater amount of protection from head injuries than any other type of bicycle helmet. They can help you avoid a lot of headache and other health problems. Wearing a helmet is also fun, and it's fun to ride a bike! Wearing a helmet can help you to stay safe when riding a bicycle. A: There are two very important points to make here. Firstly, we don't know whether your father had a bicycle helmet or not, so it is a moot point whether or not wearing one was 'required'. It is entirely possible that he chose not to wear one, and he was perfectly safe. Secondly, it is important to note that the head is not just one, big 'box'. The shape of the head changes dramatically from person to person. The bottom of the helmet is the same for everyone, but the shape of the top changes dramatically from person to person. The only helmets that can offer consistent protection are those with a specific fit. It is important to note that there are some helmets that have a lower profile, but are of a more generic shape. These helmets offer a degree of protection, but they cannot offer the same protection as a helmet that has been specifically designed for your head. There are several factors that contribute to the safety of a bicycle helmet. The shape of the helmet, the padding of the helmet, and the fit of the helmet all contribute to the safety of the helmet. It is important to note that there is a very fine line between having a helmet that is of a specific fit, and having a helmet that is of a generic fit. If the helmet has a lower profile, it may be safer than a helmet with a higher profile. However, a helmet with a lower profile may not fit your head as well as a helmet with a higher profile. The only helmets that can offer consistent protection are those with a specific fit. There are some helmets that have a lower profile, but are of a more generic shape. These helmets offer a degree of protection, but they cannot offer the same protection as a helmet that has been specifically designed for your head. This is a particularly important point because there are so many helmets on the market that have a lower profile, but are of a generic shape. For example, the Velo helmet is a great helmet that has a very low profile, but it is of a generic shape. It is important to note that the Velo helmet is still better than most helmets on the market, but it is not as good as a helmet that has been specifically designed for your head. It is important to note that there are some helmets that have a lower profile, but are of a more generic shape.

It is important to note that the Velo helmet is still better than most helmets on the market, but it is not as good as a helmet that has been specifically designed for your head. It is important to note that a helmet is a very personal thing. A helmet is not just a helmet, it is a representation of who you are, and what you are trying to achieve. If your father had a specific type of helmet, he may have been more likely to wear it, or he may have felt more comfortable wearing it. If your father did not have a specific type of helmet, it is entirely possible that he would have chosen not to wear one, even if it would have offered more protection. A: I have a hard time understanding why people don't wear helmets. It seems like they would be more than enough to protect the brain. That being said, there are some things that you should keep in mind when wearing a helmet. You should be able to see and breathe easily. A helmet that has a very low profile will restrict your vision and air flow. If you don't see well, you won't be able to make a safe decision to stop, turn or slow down. If you can't see well, you're much more likely to crash. You'll also lose your sense of balance if you can't see well. And that's important because you can't always tell when your balance is off until you've already lost it. A helmet that has a very low profile will restrict your vision and air flow."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-117,"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle.

Instead if colliding at 60mph instead it's only 40 mph resulting on less damage done due their protective gear that helps prevent serious injury or worse death! If nothing else make sure yours has these features: Glowing red lights reflective strips so others will see them better Shields face shield like some have built-in visors which help keep sun glare off eyes increasing visibility as well The bottom line is no matter what safety precautions we take there still remains car drivers who aren't paying attention, motorcyclists text messaging donut eaters speeding 1st time harley riders etc..

They protect your face and your skull and they look cool. What do you think? Do you wear one? Why not? I wear a helmet and feel that everyone should. There are far too many accident in the city and on country roads. I also don't like the idea of a child not wearing a helmet and falling off a bike and hurting their head. The only reason I could see for not wearing one is if you are a pro cyclist and do not want to mess up your hair. I agree with you. There's no reason not to wear a helmet when you're riding a bike. I mean, we all know that riding a bicycle is not totally safe. There's no guarantee that you won't be in an accident at all. That's why you should always be prepared for the worst. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to wear a helmet. I do wear a helmet. I find it difficult to understand why anyone wouldn't. As you have pointed out, they are cheap and lightweight. They could save your life. People who go without helmets are putting themselves at risk and also setting a poor example for their children. The only reasons I can see for not wearing a helmet is if you are a professional and do not want to mess up your hair, or if you are riding a bike in a competition where you do not want to mess up your hair. But for everyone else I think it is important to wear one as it could save your life. I do wear a helmet and I never ride a bike without one. It's really cheap and lightweight and it could save your life. I also think it's cool to wear one. I agree. I can't think of any reason to not wear a helmet when you ride a bike.

PaLM,cmv-117,"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many reasons to wear one: They can save your life. Helmets are the single most effective way to prevent head injuries in bicycle crashes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), helmets reduce the risk of head injury by 50% and the risk of death by 33%. They can prevent serious injuries. Even if you don't suffer a head injury in a bicycle crash, a helmet can still help to protect you from other serious injuries, such as facial fractures, neck injuries, and spinal cord injuries. They're comfortable and easy to use. Helmets have come a long way in recent years. They are now lightweight, well-ventilated, and designed to fit snugly without being uncomfortable. Most people find that they quickly get used to wearing a helmet and that they don't even notice it after a while. They're a good investment. Helmets are relatively inexpensive, and they can save you from a lifetime of medical bills and pain. If you're a cyclist, a helmet is one of the best safety purchases you can make. They're the law in many places. In many states, it is illegal to ride a bicycle without a helmet. If you're caught riding without a helmet, you could be fined or even arrested. They set a good example for others. When you wear a helmet, you're setting a good example for other cyclists. Seeing you wearing a helmet may encourage others to do the same, which could help to reduce the number of head injuries in bicycle crashes. They make you look cool. Seriously, there's a reason why so many professional cyclists wear helmets. Helmets can make you look stylish and confident. So if you're looking for a way to improve your appearance, put on a helmet! There are no good reasons not to wear a helmet. Helmets are safe, comfortable, affordable, and legal. They can save your life and prevent serious injuries. So if you're a cyclist, there's no excuse not to wear a helmet. Here are some additional tips for staying safe while riding a bicycle:  Ride defensively. Be aware of your surroundings and be prepared for the unexpected.  Obey the rules of the road. Stop for red lights, yield to pedestrians, and use hand signals.  Wear bright clothing. This will make you more visible to motorists.  Use lights at night. Lights can help you to see and be seen by motorists.  Ride with a friend. Riding with a friend can make you more visible and provide you with moral support.  Take a cycling class. A cycling class can teach you the basics of safe cycling and help you to improve your skills. By following these tips, you can help to reduce your risk of being involved in a bicycle crash."
BigScience,cmv-117,"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They protect your head from injuries and save you money in medical bills. They also help keep you safe on the road by preventing negligent drivers from hitting you as they drive around corners at high speed. Helmets have been proven to reduce death rates among different age groups over time, according to studies done both nationally and internationally. This is because helmets can prevent accidents caused by falling or being hit from behind by cars. In addition to protecting yourself against physical harm to your body, there's nothing more demoralizing than feeling like you're always putting everyone else first - especially when you're doing something that could potentially get you killed if it were to go wrong. That kind of thought should never be allowed to enter your mind while out on the roads. Remember: You're worth far more to society than anything that carelessness may cost someone else! Most people who own a vehicle want to know how much their insurance costs each month. There are some variables involved with calculating this figure so here we'll explain all about what makes up your rate and why it's important for motorists to understand these factors. When driving without proper auto insurance coverage, you put others' lives at risk as well as yours. If you've missed payments on your policy since it was established, then the insurance company will let them know via an Automatic Renewal Notice (ARN) which essentially means that your premiums will increase next year unless you stop paying off outstanding balances before December 31st. If you don't pay off your balance within 30 days after receiving any ARO notices, you might even face financial penalties imposed upon you. These fees range anywhere between 50 and 75 per day depending on how long ago the payment hasn't been made. The reason why auto insurers charge students higher monthly premiums compared to other types of customers is due to two main issues; young adults aren't carrying enough credit history yet and therefore tend to accumulate large debts leading to late payments, frequent violations, etc. Consequently, they end up having difficulty getting affordable quotes despite holding good credit records. Because they hold poor credit ratings, seniors tend to experience difficulty finding competitive prices. While older adults possess excellent credit histories that's only part of the equation - one must consider things such as deductibles, collision limits comprehensive limit and whether or not an accident ever happened prior to enrolling. In fact, most insurers won't offer low-priced policies to those aged 65 years old and above andor with no claims within five years. Unusually high-quality vehicles carry increased risks associated with them and therefore receive better protection under standard automobile insurance plans. Considering the value and price tag attached to certain models helps insurers determine their fair market value. For instance, Range Rovers typically command a lower monthly premium but still provide a decent level of cover where luxury sedans do the same thing but come across significantly cheaper. One way to cut down on the amount of money that goes into maintaining expensive vehicles would be to opt for optional insurance packages designed specifically for wealthy clients including renters insurance, uninsuredunder-insured motorist plus coverage and personal property damage liability. (Note: All these options make extra charges towards your monthly premium.) Owning multiple cars increases the likelihood of experiencing multiple collisions during the course of the year however keeping track of every single incident becomes extremely difficult at times. It does become easier to note discrepancies if you take advantage of online tools provided by insurance companies. Such software displays data collected through in-car sensors used by tech-savvy manufacturers today to detect potential hazards encountered along major highways. This information can prove incredibly useful because experienced professionals often use AI algorithms to detect signs of traffic dangers whereas novice drivers simply rely on intuition. The latter group of individuals run greater chances of causing fatalities and serious injuries owing to lack of adequate knowledge regarding transport regulations. Whether connected to a traditional plumbing system or completely independent water supply systems that function solely by gravity, hot tubs require additional maintenance efforts besides routine cleaning procedures. Hot tub owners need special care for its pool components such as filters, heater, circulation pumps, jets, lights and sanitizers. These items pose significant health threats particularly for kids and babies, so regular inspections and sanitation measures should always form part of your daily responsibilities. Otherwise, bath salts, bacteria spores, viruses and fungi thrive inside the spa making cleanup process almost impossible!"
Human,cmv-117,"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They reduce the extent of any injuries caused by a bike accident Bike helmets are proven to make any injuries obtained greatly decreased. The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88 in preventing serious injury. About 70-80 of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries. I could go on and on with these, but I don't have that much time. If you want more proof, just google ""bike helmet facts."" I've also listed my sources below. Sources: (NSFW, for some reason there is a picture of a man and woman riding naked. Still good stuff on this page, though) Helmets do not interfere with riding the bike. Helmets, if they are the correct size, do not get in the way while riding the bike. The only thing they can do is possibly disturb the airflow, but special aerodynamic helmets are made for this, if that is that big of a deal to a person. Common Counterarguments: It messes up my hair!It is uncomfortable!It makes me look like a dork! I always hear this, but, you know what, none of these are that big of a deal! I would much rather endure a little discomfort than get a possibly permanent injury to my head. But I haven't fallen off my bike in, like, years! This one. I hate when people say this. Just because you haven't gotten in a crash in a while does not mean that you are exempt from ever crashing again. This is especially true when travelling on a main road when other cars are a factor. They're so expensive!! No, just no. An average bike helmet will cost about 10 bucks or less. If you can afford a bike, then you can afford a helmet Alright, that's it for now. Please CMV!

The community is a lot more important to me than any one individual user. A: The number of downvotes is not what matters. What matters is the number of upvotes. The quality of a question is more important than the number of upvotes. When I look at a question, I look at how many upvotes it has.

A: The answer you posted in your follow-up question is what I think is the core of the issue. The problem is not that you have a bad question, but that the question is one of a class of questions that are both difficult to answer and poorly understood.

The problem is that the question is asking about something that is very difficult to understand. It is asking about the behaviour of a macro in VBA that only works in certain situations, and the OP is not aware that this is the case. The fact that it's a complicated question and the fact that the OP doesn't know it are both reasons for downvotes. I have written a very detailed answer to the question, explaining the details of the problem, explaining why the macro behaves as it does, and explaining how to write a macro that works in all situations. I've included some links to other resources, and have explained why I think that those resources are relevant. I have gone to great lengths to explain the question and to explain the issues.

PaLM,cmv-118,"""Safe"" Don't have to worry about the majority of the community using the downvote button as a disagree button Example: In the past few days, I've seen several posts on r/politics that have been downvoted to oblivion simply because they expressed a dissenting opinion. For example, one post that was critical of Bernie Sanders was downvoted to -50 points, even though it was well-written and presented valid arguments. Another post that expressed support for Donald Trump was downvoted to -30 points, even though it was also well-written and presented valid arguments. This is a problem because it discourages people from expressing their opinions on r/politics. If people know that their posts are going to be downvoted simply because they disagree with the majority, they're less likely to post at all. This stifles debate and makes r/politics a less welcoming place for people with different opinions. I'm not saying that people shouldn't be downvoted for posting offensive or trolling content. However, I think that the downvote button should be used to discourage low-quality content, not to silence dissenting opinions. I hope that the moderators of r/politics will take steps to address this issue.

BigScience,cmv-118,"""Safe"" Don't have to worry about the majority of the community using the downvote button as a disagree button Example: [The most recent example that is driving my view] In this case, consider how many people are going directly for the dislike when they encounter something like. For me it's safe and I don't need it. But other users might be upset if they see [disagree with above answer]. A: I think your concern is misplaced. As you suggest in your question: ""a lot of questions from bad sources get upvoted because of their negative score (or since they're old); so why would we want them removed?"" The problem comes here: Nowadays, if two questions share very similar metadata but only differ by one word or phrase, we'll call them duplicates. So let's say you've had an idea for an algorithm and want to implement it: ""How do I write code to find all primes less than ?"" - Now ""how do I write code..."" has already been asked here on SO, and this question doesn't really add anything new. So what happens now? Well, right off at the start, you'll probably see: Your question was recently duplicated: How do I write code to find all primes less than ? Please edit your duplicate post (where appropriate), fix its formatting, improve it, then remove any of its content that's not relevant to your own question. Thanks! That's right: instead of saying ""I need help finding out which approach works best for x, y, z; please let me know!,"" they'll say: ""Please take another look at How do I write code to find all primes less than 10 million?, modify it slightly, delete everything except the part you're interested in, and submit again."" And what's worse, while these edits will likely produce better answers overall, ultimately there may still be no significant improvement because there's a technical reason that makes some approaches much more effective than others, even though the original question didn't ask specifically whether such things were true. (Example: suppose for some reason, the fastest method wasn't actually the slowest.) To break this cycle, we should make sure our system does both things: Allowing us to identify and thus avoid duplication of identical questions: We can use the info provided by dupe-bot and fuzzy-links to keep track of similar-looking questions. (From Jeff's comment in his answer:) It's important to notice that every time someone removes text from a duplicate that matches exactly yours - yours included - you're effectively making the existing duplicate obsolete. That means essentially ignoring suggestions made based solely on similarity, and just allowing good questions to stand alone. (Again, I'm paraphrasing: remember last week, when somebody suggested adding a tag suggestion box?) For example: If you come across a discussion thread confusingly titled ""What Is This?""; maybe you'd like to leave a clarifyingnice-to-know note for future readers: What Is This? The author was wondering where he could put his ASCII art. Sounds reasonable enough. However, perhaps someone finds themselves confused by this same question writing that follows along: How do I write code to print characters starting from input character? This is completely different from: Is there anyway around doing this without having to load previous letters into buffer? There's nothing wrong with either question, per se. What matters is: Does either one provide useful information, and therefore deserves to stay? If there's no clear distinction between them, I'd suggest posting separately. It's fine if there are subtle variations around certain words; however, those variations shouldn't stop us being able to tell apart closely related questions. Back to the point: It's possible to ask questions close to each other, yet remain separate; often times simply including ""similar"" helps us understand that we're looking for something specific. When we can't clearly determine which solution fits the situation, we'd rather give our readers the benefit of doubt. But, if you feel strongly otherwise, always feel free to bring the issue up on Meta; I'll try to address it there. As far as I know there's currently no way to flag duplicate posts after they've gone live on Stack Overflow. I've seen numerous examples of older questions reworded, changed, andor deleted prior to getting put onto the site. It seems strange that once someone's priorities shift towards VV (i.e: removing low-quality questions), that nobody becomes aware of previously-asked issues regarding duplicates."

Tsinghua,cmv-119,"Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've gathered these countries have very friendly people, beautiful beaches, beautiful lakes, clean water, beautiful mountains, beautiful forests, beautiful everything. I have seen pictures of these places and it's very hard not to be captivated by the beauty and peacefulness that is being surrounded by all of these things. I'm sure you can guess what my favorite part of this dream is. . . it's the beaches. Not only are they beautiful, but they are the only thing that I would be able to do in a Scandinavian country. I would love to be able to sit on the beach, take a swim, and read a book for a week straight. I would also love to spend time on the water, either kayaking, sailing, or any other type of water activity. Another thing I've always loved about these countries is the culture. I'm sure it's something most people know, but there are so many different languages and traditions. I would love to learn more about them and maybe even become fluent in one of the languages. I've heard that Norwegians are very industrious and that they work hard and study hard. I'm not sure how this would affect my life, but it's something I would like to learn more about. I would also love to learn how to speak the language. So that's my dream, moving to Scandinavia and living in a place where the weather is mild, there are beautiful beaches, and a lot of people speak English. So if you know of a place that fits these requirements, please tell me. I would really appreciate it. Thank you. Thursday, February 15, 2015 I was really happy when my package arrived, I've been waiting for it to arrive for a while now. I don't really know what to say about it, I'm just so happy that I received it. It's the perfect book to read while on a boat, it's a book that I could never have found on my own, it's just the perfect book for a trip. I'm so excited to read it, I can't wait to share my thoughts on it with you. I also received a really cool bracelet that says 'traveling light', I'm definitely going to be taking it with me on my trip. It looks really cool and I'm sure it will be a great addition to my bracelet collection. Thank you so much for the gift, it's the perfect thing for a bookworm. Sunday, February 11, 2015 Today I have a review for you, it's a review of my favorite book, one of the most anticipated book releases of 2015. I read this book about a month ago and I absolutely loved it. It was one of the best books I've read in a long time, I would definitely read it again. So let's get to the review. ""Life is hard. And it is good. And it is sometimes hard and good at the same time."" This book is the story of an amazing girl named Elle and her journey to discover herself. Elle's life was really hard when she was younger and she didn't have a family to help her. She grew up with her mother and her sister in a shelter, but she was not happy there. Her mother was always in a fight and her sister was not very kind to her. She also had no friends and was always the odd one out.

LLAMA,cmv-119,"Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've seen they're beautiful countries with very kind people. However, I have no idea how to get started on that journey. Can anyone give me advice on what I should do? I'm 18 years old and have a year left in college. Why do you want to move there? I think you could always learn Norwegian in school if you really want to move there, but I'm not sure if the universities there are easy to get into. I've heard that it's a lot more difficult to get into uni there than in the US. I would say: Finish your studies first, then try to find a job in NorwaySwedenDenmark, then move over. I have a friend who wants to move to Sweden. He's planning on saving up enough money to live there for a year or two, and he'll probably just be working at a restaurant or something while he's there. Learn Norwegian and get a job in the country of your choice. So pretty much the same steps I would take to move to any country? Yeah, I have a lot of friends who have either moved to or are from Scandinavia. I feel like most of them are Norwegian or Swedish. Hey, I've been to Norway many times! I'm actually going there again in July. I'm not sure if you know that we have a Norwegian member on here, she's called Tatiana. She's the one that I'm going to see in Norway. Anyway, if you really want to move to Norway or one of those countries, you will need a job and somewhere to live. They usually speak English in schools, but not in everyday life. There's a lot of awesome places to visit in Norway, so if you ever go there you should definitely go to the famous tourist spots. Zoe wrote: Hey, I've been to Norway many times!

Yeah, it's absolutely gorgeous! I'm going to Oslo for a few days and then to the west coast, a place called Stavanger. It's really really beautiful there. I'm actually going to be helping Tatiana move from her house in Stavanger to a different town that's 30 minutes away. I wish I could go back there and visit, but I'm too broke."
PaLM,cmv-119,"Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've read, these countries offer a high quality of life, with strong social safety nets, excellent education systems, and beautiful natural environments. I'm particularly interested in Norway, as it seems to have a particularly strong focus on sustainability and environmental protection. I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of experience, and I'm confident that I would be able to find a good job in any of these countries. I'm also fluent in English and have a basic understanding of Norwegian. I'm single and have no children, so I'm free to move anywhere I want. I'm also willing to learn a new language, so I'm not too worried about the language barrier. I've been doing some research on how to move to a Scandinavian country, and it seems like the easiest way is to get a job offer from a company in that country. I've been sending out my resume and I've had a few interviews, but so far I haven't had any luck. I'm not giving up hope, though. I'm confident that I'll eventually find a job in a Scandinavian country and I'll be able to live out my dream of living in one of these beautiful countries. In the meantime, I'm continuing to learn Norwegian and I'm saving up money so that I can afford to move. I'm also keeping an eye on the job market and I'm applying for any jobs that I'm qualified for. I know that moving to a Scandinavian country is a big undertaking, but it's something that I'm really passionate about. I'm excited to start this new chapter in my life and I'm confident that it will be a positive experience."

I hear alot of people claiming ""The right to free speech,"" or ""The right to the pursuit of happiness."" Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. Can I ""pursue happiness"" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers? But I got the ""right""!! right? All'rights' have limits. Looking at things purely in terms of ""rights"" creates a selfish, narcissistic, entitled, unreasonable mindset. Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities."" Talking about'Rights' like this makes people think they can do what they want, coz ""I got Rights!!."" Rights are a myth, and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom."

If rights like ""free speech"" or ""free association"" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have access to them? That is a valid question. In theory, all individuals should have equal access to the rights that are considered inalienable, natural, or God-given. However, in reality, some people may face barriers to accessing these rights due to various factors such as socio-economic status, historical oppression, or discrimination. This is why it is important to advocate for and uphold these rights, and work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has equal access to them. Ultimately, the concept of natural, inalienable, or God-given rights is a philosophical concept that has been debated by scholars for centuries, but what matters is how society and its laws recognize and protect these rights for everyone."

Still it's nice to consider such things when making decisions which affect your life. In my opinion, even though I'm agnostic by nature (i.e., I can't really see anything beyond physical phenomena), there's something'spiritual' about being human especially now, given our history together on this planet. In other words, who knows what will happen (and whether we'll survive into another era) after we're gone, and perhaps nothing at all remains yet discovered hereafter maybe just smoke and mirrors... I'll probably never truly understand what happens beyond the world we live in, because the only way to find out is through experience (although I'd imagine most would prefer not to go through much suffering in order avoid re-living past pain). So maybe I'll believe in an unseen force that might lead me to some sort of realization, but anyway..."
PaLM,cmv-120,"People talk about ‘natural’ or ‘God-given rights’, but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like “free speech” or “free association” are ‘inalienable’, ‘natural’, or ‘God-given’, how come so many people don’t have them? The answer is that rights are not inherent to human beings. They are not something that we are born with. Instead, rights are created by society. They are a product of our laws and our culture. This means that rights can be taken away. If a government decides to suppress free speech, then free speech is no longer a right. If a society is intolerant of different religions, then freedom of religion is no longer a right. This is why it is so important to fight for our rights. We cannot take them for granted. We must constantly be vigilant against those who would try to take them away from us. The idea of natural rights is a powerful one. It is an idea that has inspired revolutions and has led to the creation of some of the most free and democratic societies in the world. But it is important to remember that rights are not absolute. They are not something that we are born with. They are a product of our laws and our culture. And they can be taken away. So if you value your rights, then you need to be prepared to fight for them. You need to be prepared to stand up to those who would try to take them away from you. You need to be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to protect your rights. The fight for rights is never easy. But it is a fight that is worth fighting. Because without rights, we are nothing."

Eleuther-AI,cmv-121,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a truck is going be cheaper for me than owning and maintaining 3-5 vehicles. For example: let us assume that the total cost of ownership over 5 years (this includes insurance) would only amount 15k difference between two similar trucks with identical mileage 10K miles). Since there are substantial savings on using my own vehicle rather then leasing or renting one every day (0-500 per month), as well an additional annual gas saving due having fewer trips each year (1gallon saved 800 yearly fuel used vs 831 annually if you use your personal noncommercial auto instead), assuming round numbers here we can say at some point during those first five full calendar months after purchase - they will have more money leftover from their monthly payment into which funds could go towards upgrading any equipment needed inside itself such maintenance parts etc., while still being able fund down payments toward subsequent purchases later within another few weeks time when effectively needing them again anyway; thus minimizing overall costs associated keeping track exchanging prices constantly needlessly spending much less!

PaLM,cmv-121,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new car seems like a terrible financial decision. Here are a few reasons why:  New cars lose value quickly. The moment you drive a new car off the lot, it loses about 20% of its value. And that value continues to decline over time, as more and more miles are put on the car.  Cars are a depreciating asset. This means that they lose value over time, unlike other investments, such as stocks or real estate, which can appreciate in value.  You can get a used car for much less than a new car. A used car that's a few years old can often be had for half the price of a new car, and it will still have plenty of life left in it.  Used cars are often just as reliable as new cars. A well-maintained used car can be just as reliable as a new car, and it will often cost less to maintain.  You can get a better deal on a used car. When you buy a used car, you can often negotiate a better price than you would on a new car. This is because the dealer knows that the car is a few years old and has some miles on it, so they're more likely to be willing to negotiate. Of course, there are some advantages to buying a new car. For example, a new car will have the latest features and technology, and it will be under warranty. However, these advantages are often outweighed by the disadvantages of buying a new car. Overall, I think it's better to buy a used car than a new car. You'll save money, get a better deal, and you'll have a car that's just as reliable as a new car. Here are some additional tips for buying a used car:  Do your research. Before you start shopping for a used car, do your research and learn as much as you can about different models and makes. This will help you narrow down your choices and make a more informed decision.  Get pre-approved for a loan. This will give you a better idea of how much you can afford to spend on a car, and it will also make the car-buying process easier.  Test-drive multiple cars. When you're test-driving a car, pay attention to how it feels, how it handles, and how it sounds. Make sure you're comfortable in the car and that it meets your needs.  Have the car inspected by a mechanic. Before you buy a used car, have it inspected by a mechanic to make sure there are no major problems. This will help you avoid buying a car that's a lemon. Buying a used car can be a great way to save money and get a reliable car. By following these tips, you can make the process easier and more successful."
Human,cmv-121,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new one seems like a really dumb move to me. Whatever features you are looking for in a car, you can get better features for the same or a lower price in a used car. Like, say you have 25,000 to spend on a car. You could get a nice new Toyota, or you could get a fully loaded Lexus that's less than a year old and has features that are superior in every measurable way to the new Toyota. Seems like a no-brainer to me which one I'd buy. So basically, aside from people for whom money is truly no object and I suppose people with pathological fears of sitting where others have sat, I just can't imagine any good reason for the average Joe with a limited budget and no debilitating phobias to buy a new car.

LLAMA,cmv-121,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a car outright seems to be a bad idea. I've been looking into purchasing a new car, and I have the option to lease or buy. I've read a lot of arguments for and against both, and I understand that both are good options for different circumstances. I've been reading up on the topic, and I've been trying to get a better idea on how it would work for me, specifically. For example, this article argues that buying is better if you plan on keeping the car for a long time. In this context, ""long time"" seems to be 6 years. In my situation, the car will be new (2018 or newer), and I don't really plan on keeping it for longer than 4-5 years. I've also read that it's a good idea to lease if you're looking to upgrade to a newer model every couple of years. Based on my calculations, I've been able to determine that I could afford to make payments on a 20,000 car if I leased it. It seems like I should lease, but I'm still a bit confused as to why, specifically in my case, leasing would be a good idea. I understand the math behind why leasing is usually better, but in my case, it seems like buying would be a better idea. Assuming I plan on selling the car for a newer model every 4-5 years, why would leasing be a better option for me? If you like to keep your car for a long time (more than 5 years) and drive a lot, then buying is usually better. If you drive only a little, or you like to upgrade to a new car every few years, then leasing is usually better. Due to the rapid depreciation of new cars, leasing is usually a better option. To elaborate on these points. If you drive a lot, depreciation will not be as big of an issue, as your car will depreciate anyway due to wear and tear. But if you drive little, your car will not depreciate as much. The same is true if you want to upgrade your car every few years. If you like to keep your car for a long time, then depreciation is also an issue, as it reduces the price you can get for your car when you sell it. But if you sell your car every few years, then you are not as affected by depreciation. In the US the average person drives 15,000 miles per year. If you drive a lot more than that, then you are not likely to be affected much by depreciation, but if you drive less than that, then you are. Leasing is basically paying for the depreciation of the car. You are paying for the difference between the price of the car when you lease it, and the price you get for it when you return it. So the more depreciation the car has, the more you have to pay when you lease it. Leasing is usually a better option if you like to upgrade your car every few years. But if you like to keep your car for a long time, then the cost of leasing would be higher than buying. The value of leasing is the flexibility to upgrade to a new model frequently. You just return the car to the dealer at the end of the lease term, and you can upgrade to a new model. I'll give you an example of how it works in my case. I leased a 2016 Camaro for 3 years. I payed a total of 10,000 (including taxes and fees). My lease will end in 2 months, and the residual value of my car is 17,000. This means that the car depreciated by 7,000 during my 3 year lease. Now I can either return the car to the dealer, and get the 17,000 residual value, or I can buy the car for the residual value. If I buy the car, I am paying for the depreciation of the car.

However, it's important to do your research before making a purchase. Here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. Determine your budget: Before you go shopping for a used car, figure out how much you can realistically afford to spend. This will help you narrow down your options. 2. Research the make and model: Look up information about the make and model of the car you are interested in. Read reviews, check out reliability ratings, and investigate any common problems that the car may have. 3. Check the car's history report: Get a Carfax report or a similar report that will tell you about the car's history. This will help you determine if the car has been in any accidents or has had any major repairs. 4. Take the car for a test drive: It's important that you test drive the car before you make a purchase. This will give you a chance to see how the car handles, and to listen for any unusual sounds. 5. Have the car inspected: If you are serious about buying a particular car, have it inspected by a mechanic before you make the purchase. This will help you identify any problems the car may have that you didn't notice during the test drive. By doing your research, taking your time, and being diligent, you can find a great used car that will serve you well for years to come."

Went through all of them except iPad 3 not so much because Apple hasn't really had anything else worthy lately...but mainly due to being such a premium price. For me - its by far better value than any other android player out there at this time...even if it were only 200 or less! i am going to buy an iphone next month with 16gb storage. 9 days left!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! already waiting! btw do people know how long before they can expect their handset to be available? as im getting ready to order mine soon hey guys no matter what your thoughts are about apple just think again,its coming to australia down under very soon and its gonna cost us nearly 10000 for a 32 gb version"
LLAMA,cmv-122,"Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth can it do that my android tablet can't? The app selection is not really any better. I've been looking for a decent app for my android tablet that can add effects to video and make it look like you are a zombie or a vampire or something, but the only one that I have found is on the ipad and it costs 4.99. I could care less about games, but that's about it. 2 bucdenny, Apr 16, 2011 My wife had the original Motorola Xoom and we both hated it. I have a Motorola Xoom Wifi and it's ok. But the user interface is so much more refined on the iPad. That's the big difference. They are both powerful tablets with a lot of apps. But the way you navigate through them is what makes all the difference. 3 patmw123, Apr 16, 2011 I would say the iPad has an advantage in the area of apps. I can get all of the apps I want on my Android tablet, but I often have to compromise on the quality or features. 4 Mattl316, Apr 16, 2011 It is a good choice but the limited hardware customization means you are stuck with what you buy. I think the biggest difference is how the UI is implemented. The iPad is a lot more polished in that regard and it's much more intuitive and easy to use. The Xoom for example is quite buggy and a bit sluggish in certain areas. The Xoom also has the ""one of everything"" problem that Android phones have had. The main problem with Android tablets is that there are very few apps built specifically for them. Android's app store is just beginning to get tablet-centric apps and most of them are ports from iPhone apps. The Android tablet UI is also very flaky and not very smooth. You can never forget you're using an Android tablet. 5 czerdrill, Apr 16, 2011 nysmoky Member I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, even before the Xoom. It's thinner, has a better screen, and is far more portable. It's basically a big phone. I'm running the Honeycomb 3.1 beta on my Tab and it's pretty awesome. 6 nysmoky, Apr 16, 2011 All good points. As far as hardware goes, you can get the iPad2 in both WiFi and 3G. And if you want 3G, you have to get one from ATT or Verizon. But you can get an iPad2 with 3G from either carrier. But I don't like the 3G4G carrier models, as there is no way to unlock them and use them on other carriers. I just can't believe that the Xoom WiFi only model doesn't work on other carriers. If they would have put the cellular radios in, it would have worked on other carriers. 7 jkhonea, Apr 16, 2011 I agree on the Motorola Xoom. It's a disappointment. We bought my mother a wifi Xoom. It has a terrible lag. I also agree with the tablet optimized apps for Android. There are very few apps. My wife has an iPad and the apps are more mature. 8 TOMMYBOT, Apr 16, 2011 I agree with you, the iPad does not have much to offer over an Android tablet. What I would say is that the iPad's UI is more polished. The Android UI is a little clunky, but it is getting better. One of the biggest complaints that I have about my Xoom is that there are not many apps designed specifically for tablets. Most of the apps are just ports of the phone app. In all honesty, I'm happy with my Xoom, but I wish that there were more apps designed specifically for tablets. I find it hard to believe that the iPad has over 200,000 apps, and the Xoom has less than 50. 9 jcardona1, Apr 1"

PaLM,cmv-122,"Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth is so great about it that it's worth spending $500+ for? I've used an iPad before, and it's nice enough, but I don't see what it does that my $100 Android tablet doesn't do. The Android tablet has a worse screen, but it's still good enough for watching videos and browsing the web. It also has a worse camera, but I don't take pictures with my tablet anyway. And it has less storage, but I can always use a microSD card if I need more. So, what am I missing? Why is the iPad so much more expensive than other tablets? Is it just the brand name? Here are a few reasons why people might think the iPad is worth the money:  The iPad is the most popular tablet on the market. This means that there are more apps available for it than for any other tablet. This is important if you want to be able to use your tablet for a variety of tasks, such as playing games, watching videos, or reading books.  The iPad has a high-quality display. The screen is bright, colorful, and has a high resolution. This makes it great for watching videos, playing games, or reading books.  The iPad is very portable. It's thin and light, and it fits easily into a bag or purse. This makes it easy to take with you wherever you go.  The iPad is backed by Apple. Apple is a well-known and respected company, and its products are known for being reliable. This gives you peace of mind knowing that you're buying a quality product. Of course, there are also some reasons why you might not want to buy an iPad. For example, it's expensive, and it doesn't have as much storage as some other tablets. Additionally, some people find the iOS operating system to be restrictive. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to buy an iPad is a personal one. You need to decide what features are important to you and what you're willing to pay for them. If you're looking for a high-quality tablet with a lot of features, the iPad is a great option. However, if you're on a tight budget or you don't need all of the bells and whistles, there are other tablets that might be a better fit for you."
BigScience,cmv-123,"I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking about how Republicans can pick up enough votes to beat Trump and prevent him from running for president again. Trump's supporters are easily identifiable as conservatives in every aspect of their lives. They believe that government should be small and tightly controlled; they value individual liberty above all else; they support strict gun control laws, especially regarding assault weapons; religious freedom is important to them; tax cuts benefit corporate America (they don't care much if it's corporations like Amazon or Facebook) not the average American, etc., etc. The list goes on but I'm sure you get it. These people have consistently voted Republican since 2004 at least and many more years before that when they were able to vote yet didn't know what party was supposedly correct. I've seen some outright conservative voters who've switched parties over the course of living in this country. But there are a ton more who aren't even close to being true conservatives. They're simply trying to use conservatism as an umbrella term for everything that isn't left-wing liberalism which is acceptable because that's where everyone gets offended, right? They say these things so loudly that no one ever asks them questions about their beliefs anymore. I still see comments related to abortion, gay marriage, same-sex parenting, transgender rights, women's rights, anti-immigration policies, illegal immigration, guns, capital punishment, religion, national security, environmental issues, money politics, social welfare programs, foreign policy, climate change, black income disparity, the economy, trade deals with other countries, taxes and spending, debt, military spending, health care reform, fake news, voter suppression, gerrymandering, racial profiling, sex discrimination, civil liberties, racism, homelessness, poverty, crime rates, police brutality, blind faith in science and evidence-based medicine, debates between experts versus opinion writers, medical marijuana, meddling from outside groups such as Big Pharma and food companies, media bias, political corruption, human trafficking, child labor, bullying, gender identity, pornography, domestic violence, abuse, rape culture, death penalty, affirmative action, judicial appointments at federal courts, and myriad others throughout history and present day...all of those topics are discussed daily online without any debate or discussion except calling someone a bigoted asshole. That's called mainstream coverage today: just another way to discount your opinions and make yourself feel better than anyone else does. Suffice it to say, they're not looking back at statements made 100 years ago and saying ""oh yeah? Well now we're liberals!"" they're looking down at themselves and judging themselves based on today's standards instead. And there's nothing wrong with that either. Republican candidates are often labeled ideological cranks and extremists while GOP leaders constantly claim Democrats love policies they oppose. There used to be two words coming out of both mouths - ""conservatism."" In fact, conservatives tend to think free market capitalism is good. Unfortunately, political discourse has become very polarized in recent decades. In 2007 I wrote this article titled ""The Left Is Right Now. Here's Why You Shouldn't Be Surprised That It's Not Going Away Soon."" My rationale behind this title stems from something that happened last week then President Barack Obama released his State Of The Union Address. He stated he would stand firm against his own advice given earlier in the year to congressional members on desired changes needed in healthcare legislation. My understanding of the White House position was they wanted as little involvement from Congress as possible so that they'd have full control of implementing new law mandating best practices. What surprised many Americans was that a couple weeks after releasing that statement inside information surfaced indicating what really had been said was: ""We want universal healthcare regardless of ability to pay. We want insurance plans that cover essential services always, never excluding anything unless medically necessary. We don't want special privileges for any group - including doctors, hospitals, drug manufacturers or insurance companies."""

It's true that the changing demographics of the United States, particularly the increasing number of minority voters, have shifted the political landscape in recent years. However, voter turnout is also a critical factor that can affect the outcome of an election - if young or minority voters do not turn out to vote, their impact will be limited.

Is the Republican party just too old to win the next election? Let's look at the demographics of the Republican Party. According to the Pew Research Center, 62 of Republicans are between the ages of 50 and 83. Only 31 are 18-29 years old. Now let's look at the 2012 election. According to the New York Times, Obama won 60 of the 18-29 vote in 2012. If you believe that 2016 is going to be a lot like 2012, then it's easy to see why the GOP is in trouble. If the Republicans can't get the younger voters out to the polls, they will lose. The Republicans have two choices: 1) They can change their stance on social issues and appeal to young voters. This strategy is being used by the Libertarian party. 2) They can change the demographics of the party. This means that the party needs to become more diverse. It's going to be a very interesting election cycle."

Demographics are changing in America. Firstly, Non-whites become a higher percent of the US population seemingly every year. This could be for a number of reasons, like immigration, but it's a good thing for the democrats because non-whites are statistically more likely to be liberal. I don't see this trend changing so I have a hard time seeing how the a Conservative will be voted into office again. Secondly, Conservatives are aging. Statistically, older people are typically more conservative whereas younger people are typically more liberal. The older Conservatives will eventually all die and be replaced by young liberals. I must be overlooking something, or missing some way that Conservatives can get votes in the future. Has a situation like this happened before? edit: view is changed"

Tsinghua,cmv-124,"To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm going to start by outlining the basic thesis of this post, which is that an information asymmetry is present in the global energy trade, and that this asymmetry is largely due to the role of the US in it. I'm not going to discuss the geopolitics here, but it's important to note that in the US-led world, the US has a vested interest in keeping the prices low. In other words, a ""free market"" in energy isn't necessarily a free market, and a competitive market isn't necessarily a competitive market. The most glaring example of this is the oil trade, where the US sells vast amounts of crude oil to the rest of the world, yet has no interest in seeing the prices of oil go up. The obvious question then becomes: why is the US selling so much oil? There are a few reasons, but it boils down to the fact that the US is the world's biggest energy producer, and it's a big market for its energy exports. It's also a fairly big market for oil imports, so it's important to keep a lid on the prices. I'm going to outline three ways that this information asymmetry is being exploited: 1) The IMF and World Bank have policies that favor exporters, 2) the oil trade is very tightly controlled, and 3) the US uses its oil exports to set a price floor for the rest of the world. I'll also discuss some possible ways to reduce this asymmetry, but first I'll describe how it's being exploited. The IMF and World Bank have policies that favor exporters In the 1970s, the US and Europe imposed sanctions on Iran and Iraq, and this was a very serious problem for them. In the 1980s, the US and UK pushed through the Iran-Iraq War, which ended up being a disaster for both countries. In 1985, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. In 1991, the US and UK invaded Iraq, which led to the Persian Gulf War. In 1999, Iraq invaded Kuwait. This was a problem for the US and the UK, because they had imposed sanctions on Iraq and Iran. Iran was on the verge of going bankrupt, and Iraq had virtually no oil. Iraq was a major supplier of oil to the UK and the US, so the US and UK needed to be able to get oil from somewhere else. The IMF and World Bank then came up with a solution. They decided that the US and UK would be allowed to re-enter the oil market if they were willing to pay a price of 100barrel for oil. At the time, this was a ridiculous price, and nobody else was willing to pay it. So, the US and UK took the advice of the IMF and World Bank, and set up a huge oil import business in Africa. In the early 2000s, the price of oil rose, and in 2004, the US and UK finally left the market. As it turns out, the oil price wasn't the only problem the US and UK had in the 1990s and 2000s. The banks were also having trouble with oil. There was a glut of oil in the world, and the oil prices were plummeting. Oil prices had been above 100barrel in 1998, and the price of oil crashed below 30barrel in 2001. In 2002, a number of oil companies went bankrupt. At the time, the US and UK were very interested in buying oil from these companies, and the IMF and World Bank came up with a solution: The IMF and World Bank decided that these oil companies would be allowed to go bankrupt, and they would be allowed to liquidate their assets. This would allow them to pay back their debts, but it would also create a huge glut of oil. The US and UK would then be able to buy oil at a cheap price, since the oil companies had to sell it. The IMF and World Bank then began promoting the idea of austerity programs, which would be a boon to the oil industry. As I mentioned earlier, austerity programs have been very successful in creating a glut of oil. As the oil price crashed, the oil companies had to sell their oil at a discount, so they did what they could to maximize the amount of oil they could sell. They also began selling their assets at a discount, so the US and UK were able to buy them at a bargain price. Now, there are a number of ways this could have been avoided."
Human,cmv-124,"To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm talking strictly about advantages in professional, competitive, skill-based, PvP shooters given by playing at a lower resolution, taller aspect ratio (4:3 vs 16:9), or narrower FOV (excepting personal tolerance for distortion). [This is the photo that prompted my question.] There is absolutely NO WAY that playing at 1024x768 (and unless that's a 1440p monitor, I think it's reasonable to suspect it's actually 800x600) gives him ANY advantage, and is instead a handicap, but it's not uncommon for professionals to play this way (I'm thinking in particular of the CS:GO CS:S scene). Points of confusion: With upscaling disabled, the pixels are the same size as they would be if he were playing at native resolution, so there's no'zoom' offered. Lower resolution means, definitively, less rendering precision. If an enemy's head is visible over an edge at distance, it may not take up enough of the player's FOV to be rendered (possibly an unlikely example). Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p resolutions. UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen. Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio. Limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:916:10 aspect ratio.

I'm probably just being too polite and downplay it too much. As I see it, one of two things happened: 1) The vast majority of people who voted in favour were either scared or lazy andor stupid andor whatever else you want to call them but they didn't take a real look at what was happening before voting. They had no idea... 2) There are actually many clever rationalists that know how to do research into their own self interest without resorting to astroturfing tactics not shooting themselves in the foot by saying something that may prove counterproductive once it becomes clear there aren't as many people supporting that particular theory as said proponents intended. A: There has been talk about whether mainstream science supports evolution over creationism. The most direct (and controversial - some may say biased) evidence comes from DNA testing, which shows that dinosaurs evolved through gradual change rather than by sudden speciation events. It's also possible in principle to determine if fossils have been re-buried over long periods of time versus very recently. This leads us to consider the issue of fossil dating techniques and errors introduced when using methods such as radiocarbon age determination. For example, fossils like ammonites can give far off dates because they accumulate carbon isotope ratios slowly over hundreds or thousands of years instead of quickly during a short period after death. A similar problem exists with other kinds of paleontological data collected regularly from animals living today e.g., tooth decay rates. These data show long ranges between teeth eruption patterns consistent with normal rates of aging. All these problems could lead to mistaken conclusions based on dated material. Consider an example: Suppose we find a small bone fragment near a cave wall containing bones from several extinct mammals. Such fragments tend to contain only minute amounts of organic matter so the nitrogen content would be low. We assume that those tiny samples represent the diet of the ancient mammal. However, further analysis reveals that each sample contains unexpectedly high levels of C-14 activity suggesting rapid burial and possibly conch shell pollution. Using our skeptical approach we might conclude ""These pieces don't seem to match up well enough to indicate any sort of dietary relationship yet even considering all known biases associated with dating there still seems to be good statistical support here for a connection!"" So assuming nothing more extreme happens, here's my guess why it's likely we'll never know exactly what's happened here: If we did use older dating techniques then we'd simply end up looking for clues scattered around without knowing where to look first perhaps comparing different geologic formations initially to help narrow possible focus areas. Subsequent analysis would later refine results. But given current knowledge, radical alternative hypotheses will always remain within reach until proven wrong."

I'm going to tell you why I think your PC is a better alternative to a console, but I'm also going to tell you why I don't think the PC is better than a console in every single way. In my previous thread, I pointed out that the biggest problem PC gamers have is that they try to justify their hobby, and end up missing the big picture in the process. We've been talking for a long time about the things we think PC gamers are better at, but those are really irrelevant to the question we should be asking: Why should people buy a PC over a console? PC gamers are better at owning the latest hardware. But that doesn't matter for new players. PC gamers are better at fixing problems. But that doesn't matter to people who are happy with the status quo. PC gamers are better at mods. But that doesn't matter to people who don't play games that need mods. PC gamers are better at emulation. But that doesn't matter to people who want to play new games, not old ones. PC gamers are better at upgrading. But that doesn't matter to people who want to play the same games they did last year. PC gamers are better at buying hardware. But that doesn't matter to people who want to buy games, not hardware. PC gamers are better at optimizing. But that doesn't matter to people who are happy with the console experience. PC gamers are better at connecting peripherals. But that doesn't matter to people who just want to sit down and play. In other words, the things that PC gamers brag about are either irrelevant to new players, or they only matter to people who are willing to invest more time and money into their hobby. I want to be clear: All of these things are great. I'm proud of my hobby and I love it. But I know that I'm not the average gamer. I don't think there's anything wrong with the way the average gamer plays, either. What I want to do is show people that PC gaming is the better option, so that they can decide for themselves. And the way I'm going to do that is by demonstrating how PC gaming is the better option for the things that new players are going to do. Because new players don't want to overclock or buy new hardware or get the best resolution. They want to sit down and play. And that's what I'm going to talk about today. Now, I know that this is going to be controversial. I know that the PCMR is going to take issue with some of the things I'm about to say. That's okay. I just want you to know that I didn't just pull these ideas out of thin air. I'm basing them off of my experiences. I'm basing them off of the experiences of people I know. I'm basing them off of the hundreds of emails I've received from people who play games on their PCs and consoles. I'm basing them off of the conversations I've had with people who are on the fence about PC gaming. When I first bought a gaming PC, I wanted to play WoW and Skyrim. I know, PCMR...I get it. But the thing is, my gaming PC didn't just let me play those games. It let me play every game I wanted to play. It let me play every game that came out in the next few years. It let me play everything that was relevant. I'm not talking about the hardware here. I'm talking about the platform. Think about the games you want to play over the next few years. Think about the games you want to play in 5 years. Think about the games you want to play in 10 years. Do you think you're going to have trouble finding those games on PC? Now think about the games you want to play on console in the next few years. Now think about the games you want to play in 5 years. Think about the games you want to play in 10 years. Do you think you're going to have trouble finding those games on console? The reason why I prefer to buy games on PC is because I want to buy games that are going to matter in 5 years.

PaLM,cmv-125,"This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the issue. I believe that abortion should be legal, but I am not sure if it should be legal in all cases. I think that there are some cases where abortion is clearly justified, such as when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, I am not sure if abortion should be legal in cases where the pregnancy is the result of consensual sex. On the one hand, I believe that women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. I believe that they should be able to choose whether or not to have an abortion, regardless of the circumstances. I also believe that it is important to protect the rights of the unborn child. I believe that the unborn child has a right to life, and that abortion should not be used as a form of birth control. I am not sure where I come down on this issue. I think that there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate. I am still trying to decide what I believe is the right answer. Here are some of the arguments that I have heard in favor of abortion:  Women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. This is a fundamental human right. Women should be able to choose whether or not to have an abortion, regardless of the circumstances.  Abortion is a necessary medical procedure. In some cases, abortion is the only way to save the life of the mother or to prevent serious health problems.  Abortion is a form of birth control. Abortion should be available to women who do not want to have a child. It is a safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy. Here are some of the arguments that I have heard against abortion:  The unborn child has a right to life. Abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human being. It is a violation of the most basic human right.  Abortion is harmful to women. Abortion can have serious physical and psychological consequences for women. It can lead to depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Abortion is morally wrong. Abortion is the taking of a human life. It is a sin against God.

God bless you.:) 5 years ago My Mom, 63, was in the hospital for a blood clot and for tests, so I was told to stay with her for 2 days. On the first day, I was in her room watching TV when I noticed a bit of blood on her pillow. I then noticed that her left arm was all red and looked like she had been bleeding for a while. It was pretty obvious that her veins had burst on her left arm. Her veins on her right arm were much smaller and she was only slightly red on that arm. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she had had a headache and went to get a aspirin. I said ""oh, you need to go to the ER"" and she said ""oh, I am fine."" I asked her if she was having a heart attack and she said ""no."" I got up to leave the room and she asked me to go to the bathroom with her. I got in the bathroom and I saw her having a heart attack. I was on my knees, screaming at the top of my lungs, ""Momma, Momma, please open your eyes, please open your eyes."" I was holding her hand and her eyes were open. I was yelling at her to come back to me. I kept yelling at her and she slowly turned her head towards me and smiled at me. She then closed her eyes and her face became cold. I felt so helpless. I was a 17 year old girl and I couldn't do anything to save her. I went to the ER and they gave me some morphine. They told me that my Mom had died in my arms and they did CPR on her for 30 minutes. I had to be in the ER for 3 days and when I was released I didn't know what to do. I had a constant ringing in my ears and I couldn't concentrate on anything. I had to go back to the ER and they told me that I had a hearing problem. I had no idea what I was going through. I just knew that I needed to do something and I wanted to be with my Mom. I have been diagnosed with chronic migraines and I have had my first migraine in the last week. I have been to the ER twice because of the migraines and I was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was wrong. I am still getting migraines and my ears are still ringing. I am still in the ER 2 times a week. I am in my early 20's and I don't know what to do. I am always in the ER and I am tired of it. I am a young girl and I am having to deal with so much. My mom is gone and I can't even go to her grave. I feel so lost and I am not sure what to do. I am getting very sick of it. Please, please, please, help me. I am so sorry for your loss.

LLAMA,cmv-125,"This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the best way to approach this situation, and would love to hear some opinions. My 8 year old daughter has a best friend from kindergarten who has been a really great influence for the most part. This girl has a lovely family who I am close with and I adore her parents. She has never had a family pet so my daughter has been instrumental in helping her to appreciate and love animals. The one thing I have always been uncomfortable with is the amount of exposure she has to violent media. Her family has never censored her exposure to tv and movies. I have been to her house often and have never seen her parents turn the tv or movies off or discuss them in any way with her. They have never said anything about the violence she sees. She can talk about the deaths of characters and the violence and the monsters with a huge smile on her face as if it's nothing. It is actually unnerving. I have discussed this with my daughter and we have talked about it often and we have seen her family do the same. I have done my best to prevent her from watching these things at my house, but it's so hard. My daughter is so loving and wants to share everything with her friend so she wants her to see everything that we see. Now, I am faced with a new issue. Her friend told my daughter that her parents showed her the movie ""Halloween"" the other night, and that it was really scary, but she didn't cry or get scared. She said the babysitter was in the room while they watched it, and that the babysitter was scared. My daughter told me that she would not be watching that movie because she did not want to be scared and she asked me to tell the girl's mom that she wouldn't be watching it at our house. I told her that I would, and we decided to leave it at that. I am very conflicted about this. I feel strongly that I need to talk to this girl's mother about this, but I don't want to make waves. It's not my place to parent someone else's child. I know that. However, I think that this movie is WAY too violent and scary for an 8 year old and if I were her mother, I would not allow my child to see it. I want to know if the mom even knows what the movie is about and if she would allow it if she knew. I have to decide if I am going to bring this up to the mom or just pretend that I didn't hear about it. I don't know what to do. I love this little girl and I think she is a great kid, but I don't think that watching this movie is appropriate. I hate to make waves, but I am worried about what else she may be watching at her house if this is an example of what she is allowed to watch. Honestly, I think your daughter should stop spending so much time with this friend, unless you can find out if this was an isolated incident or not. My 8 year old would not watch that movie. Not even close. If this is the one and only movie your daughter's friend has seen that is above her age level, then I'd just let it go. It's not a big deal. But if you think she's being exposed to other moviesgamesTV shows that are not age appropriate, I'd be concerned. I don't think there's any reason to bring it up with the mom unless you think it's a regular occurrence. I think you should leave it. If you want to bring it up with the mom, then you could just say ""I heard that the girls watched Halloween together. That movie's so scary! They must have had a fun time watching it together. What did they think of it?"" And see if the mom even knows what the movie is. I agree with PP that this is a one-off event. It's not good parenting to allow an 8 year old to watch that movie, but it's not something to get upset over. In general, I'd keep the girls apart more because of the violence exposure and lack of parental supervision, but since you've made your peace with that I'd leave it alone. I agree with PP. I would not bring it up. It is a one off event. I don't think it's your place to say anything. She's not your child. However, I'"

They are both the overwhelming amount of perpetrators and victimized, though women are victimized significantly, as you'd expect, in intimate crimes and sex-related offenses. Aside from criminality, men are also more likely to be impulsive and aggressive which is likely to eliminate cohesion and cause undue caution due to the erratic, unpredictably violent and harmful action of this sub-group.

BigScience,cmv-126,"For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where the victim is usually women, but you only see 2-3 men committing them on average. Women are not sired by their fathers up to birth and it's mostly ignored as well. These men have no such obligation towards their daughters either so there isn't any real incentive to care or protect them unless it affects his own reproductive success (which he doesn't). This makes it possible for females who can choose if she wants her father or husband. On top of this all these female children will be raised without proper parental involvement from both parents which means they're going to enter into relationships with people who don't care much about them and therefore tend to treat them badly because less important than himher. This goes back also beyond biology, there's also something called ""the social contract"" which basically states that: Either everyone agrees that some things should go according to certain rules or none at all. So most societies try very hard to enforce those rules even against individuals who violate them voluntarily due to external circumstances - like an epidemic or war etc. But nobody would really do anything voluntarly against the wishes of another individual within one's own family. Therefore girls grow up knowing how terrible your life could be if someone else's daughterson died under horrible circumstances. I think it just evokes feelings similar to what I had while reading THE CROWN OF TARZAN: The story takes place inside the lion kingdom (or at least close enough) during the early days of African Civilization. Notably around 1000 BC judging from the artifacts found. It follows a young hero named Keziah whose mother was killed defending the village from invaders and left behind two orphaned sons. As time went along one son grew up into a man (African hunter-gatherer type guy here), whereas the other became a girl (who apparently developed abilities equivalent to human empathy). But then things got interesting; In fact rather tragic since the boy's father turned out to be a witch doctor (in order for him to survive because otherwise he'd have been eaten alive by lions.) That guy decided to give the child powers equal to hers and proceeded to stalk her through the jungle where she's trying to make friends with humans. Eventually they end up getting married after some magical ceremonies involving weird tribal rituals and sacrifices. (There's a long list of ingredients used including sheep blood.) Anyway it's extremely sadistic action taking place mainly between the families living in that area (Hunters vs Gathering peoples) And yet there were many elements from ancient mythology as well as aspects related to modern day religion mixed together... It made me feel as though I'd seen these stories before somewhere... but my mind couldn't bring itself to associate with any specific culture nation. Yeah, sure, that's exactly why I'm thinking of writing my novel based on Temujin no matter what happens next:P It's kind of a sci-fi fantasy book but definitely has elements of history too which is why English language version hasn't been released yet.. Yes, I agree. And I've read some books written by Chinese authors that fit pretty well into the Western genre, namely space opera style ones.

PaLM,cmv-126,"For whatever reason, men commit about 80-90% of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes, where men still commit the majority but not as overwhelmingly, but the gap is still significant. There are a number of theories about why this is the case. Some argue that it's due to biological differences between men and women. For example, men are more likely to be aggressive and impulsive, which can lead to criminal behavior. Others argue that it's due to social factors. For example, men are more likely to be socialized to be dominant and competitive, which can lead to them taking risks that lead to criminal behavior. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that men commit the majority of crimes. This has a number of implications for society. For example, it means that men are more likely to be incarcerated, which can have a negative impact on their lives and their families. It also means that women are more likely to be the victims of crime, which can have a negative impact on their safety and well-being. There is no easy solution to the problem of male crime. However, there are a number of things that can be done to address it. These include providing more opportunities for men to succeed in legitimate ways, addressing the root causes of male aggression and impulsivity, and changing the way that men are socialized. It is important to remember that not all men are criminals. However, the fact that men commit the majority of crimes is a serious problem that needs to be addressed."

OpenAI,cmv-126,"For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where women are nearly as likely to commit crimes as men, but the gender disparity remains significant when it comes to violent crimes. There are various reasons why men are more likely to commit crimes. One explanation is that men tend to have higher levels of testosterone, which is associated with aggressive behavior. Additionally, societal norms and expectations often emphasize traditional masculinity, including being tough, aggressive, and dominant, which can lead some men to engage in criminal behavior to prove their masculinity. Other factors that contribute to the gender disparity in crime include differences in socialization between men and women, financial pressures, and lack of access to educational and employment opportunities. However, it is important to note that not all men are prone to criminal behavior and that there are many successful and law-abiding men in society."

Even more interesting is that fact that men commit suicide at a rate of 4:1 and are the victims of homicide at a rate of 4:1. It's a fact that the media does not spend a lot of time on the issue of male violence. In fact the media tends to portray men in a much more positive light than women. When you consider that our gender makes up only 49 of the population but commits 90 of crimes, it's probably a good thing that the media does not focus on this fact. When the media does focus on male violence, it is in the context of war and military action. And it's no wonder considering that since the beginning of history men have been responsible for about 90 of war-related deaths. There are two reasons that I believe that male violence is largely ignored by the media. First and foremost the media is controlled by men. I don't think it's a coincidence that in the U.S. only 2 of all newspapers, TV, radio and magazine publishers are female. Or that only 5 of radio and television stations and 15 of newspapers are owned by women. Secondly, the media doesn't focus on male violence because it doesn't want to be labeled as anti-male. The fear is that if it did address the issue it would cause the public to become suspicious of all men. Unfortunately, the media is not as successful at ignoring male violence as it would like to be. In fact, I think that it is widely believed that all men are inherently violent. And while I don't believe this to be true, the media does little to dispel the myth. In fact I would go as far as to say that the media sensationalizes male violence. It focuses the attention of the public on the most gruesome and violent crimes, most of which are committed by men. And I believe that it does this because it knows that this is what the public wants to see. The media is successful at selling stories about men because it knows what sells. The public has a fascination with male violence. And while the media does nothing to dispel this myth, it doesn't do a whole lot to feed the public's appetite either. Some argue that it is the media's job to educate the public about the truth. I don't necessarily agree with this. In fact I think that the media has no obligation to educate anyone. I believe the media's job is to tell the story. As someone who has worked in the media for many years I can tell you that the primary function of the media is not to educate. It's job is to sell a story to as many people as possible. And the story must be relevant to the society that it serves. I believe that the reason that the media doesn't focus on male violence is that it doesn't sell. As a matter of fact, the media doesn't focus on a lot of issues because they don't sell. So if the media doesn't have an obligation to educate, then who does? I think that we do. If we are concerned about the impact of male violence in our society, then we must find ways to educate the public about it. I believe that we can change the public's perception about male violence. But it is going to take a coordinated effort to do so. It is not going to happen overnight, and it is not going to happen on its own. If we want to make a change in the public's perception about male violence then we have to make it happen. We can't rely on the media to do it for us."
LLAMA,cmv-127,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean you're immune to consequences from what you say."" While I disagree with this view, it is at least a reasonable position that one can take. However, the corollary to this argument is also worth considering. If free speech means the state can't punish you for what you say, why does it mean your employer can? If your freedom of speech means you have the freedom to say unpopular things without being punished by the government, why does it mean you don't have the freedom to say unpopular things without being punished by your employer? Or, to put it another way, if the state can't punish you for being a racist, why can your employer? The argument that ""free speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences"" is something I have long argued against. Firstly, it's not actually true. It's true that free speech is a negative right, but it's not a right to say things without consequences. To understand the true nature of freedom of speech, we need to examine the rationale behind it. Why is it that the state should not punish you for what you say? It's because speech is essential for the democratic process. As I've argued before, the democratic process is ineffective without free speech. We can't make informed decisions about who we should vote for if we can't freely discuss the merits of candidates or policies. As such, the purpose of free speech is to maximise the ability of the people to have an effective democratic process. The reason the state should not punish you for what you say is because to do so is to undermine the democratic process. But, as I've argued before, the state isn't the only thing that can undermine the democratic process. If there's anything that has a greater ability to undermine democracy than the government, it's the media. If the media can't effectively report on the news because its reporters are afraid to speak freely, it is the democratic process that suffers. In fact, the ability for the media to report on the news effectively and freely is essential to democracy. If the media can't report on the news without fear of reprisal, it cannot report on the news effectively. The media is already subject to much self-censorship, and it is already on a collision course with the government. If we start to allow media organisations to sack journalists for what they say, there will be a further clampdown on free speech. So, if free speech exists to ensure the democratic process is effective, it must surely apply to the media. It is no good to have a right to free speech, if that right only applies to the state. In fact, it is the media that should have the most freedom of speech. If we have a right to free speech, it must apply to all individuals and all organisations. A free press is essential for a free society. If we don't have a free press, we don't have a free society. Alan Jones is a man who has abused his free speech rights for far too long. He has been allowed to say outrageous things without punishment, and he has gotten away with it. He has gotten away with it because he's rich, because he's powerful, and because he's white. The only way to prevent Jones from abusing his free speech rights is to show that there are consequences for abusing those rights. If we don't show that there are consequences for abusing free speech, we will continue to see people like Jones abusing their free speech rights. The only way to show Jones that he can't abuse his free speech is to punish him. And the best way to punish him is to stop listening to him. Do not listen to his show. Do not click on links to it. Do not mention it to your friends. Do not share links to it. Do not support the station that supports him. Do not listen to the station that supports him. Do not watch the TV shows that support him. Do not support the newspapers that support him. Do not buy the products of the advertisers that support him. Don't punish Jones because he said something offensive. Punish him because he abuses his right to free speech. Punish him because he's a bully. Punish him because he doesn't deserve to be listened to. Free speech is a right. It'"
Tsinghua,cmv-127,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean you can say whatever you want."" But this is not true. I think the term free speech means two things: 1. The government cannot control what you say, but they can prosecute you for what you say. 2. You can say whatever you want, but you cannot control what others say about you. The reason I think this is true is because the definition of free speech is free speech. To ""control"" what you say is to take away your freedom to say it. To ""control"" what others say about you is to take away their freedom to say what they want about you. These are the two key freedoms that I think we should all cherish. This is why I say it is very important to make sure we understand what free speech is. I have heard people say they are against free speech when they mean they are against speech they disagree with. But the truth is, if you are against speech you disagree with, you are not for free speech, and if you are for free speech, you are not against speech you disagree with. So when you say you are against free speech, what you really mean is you are against speech you disagree with."
Human,cmv-127,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else."" If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd] will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons. The first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech. Secondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them. The final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point. Just to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase ""freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences"" does not. Edit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit. Some people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest. Edit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm not saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them. A lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding. uVordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic] , and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses.

PaLM,cmv-127,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises, it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be “free speech means the state can’t control what you say. It doesn’t mean you can say whatever you want without consequence.” This is a common misconception about free speech, and it is one that can have serious consequences. Free speech is a fundamental right that is essential to a free and democratic society. It allows us to express our opinions, challenge the status quo, and hold our leaders accountable. Without free speech, we would not be able to have a meaningful debate about the issues that matter most to us. However, free speech is not absolute. There are some limits on free speech, such as the incitement of violence or the defamation of others. These limits are necessary to protect the rights of others and to ensure that free speech does not harm society. The key to understanding free speech is to recognize that it is a right that is balanced against other important rights and interests. When we try to define the limits of free speech, we need to strike a balance between the right to free speech and the rights of others. There are a number of factors that we need to consider when we are trying to determine whether or not a particular speech is protected by the First Amendment. These factors include:  The content of the speech: Is the speech political, religious, or commercial?  The context of the speech: Was the speech made in a public forum or in a private setting?  The intent of the speaker: Was the speaker trying to inform, persuade, or incite violence?  The effect of the speech: Did the speech cause harm to others? By considering these factors, we can make a more informed decision about whether or not a particular speech is protected by the First Amendment. It is important to remember that free speech is not just about protecting the rights of those who we agree with. It is also about protecting the rights of those who we disagree with. If we only allow speech that we agree with, then we are not truly free. Free speech is a right that we should all cherish and protect. It is a right that is essential to a free and democratic society."
OpenAI,cmv-127,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean you can say whatever you want without any consequences."" Can you explain this statement and give an example? Sure, the statement means that although individuals have the constitutional right to free speech, it doesn't mean they are free from facing consequences for that speech. For instance, individuals can be held accountable for hate speech or incitement to violence, as these types of speech can cause harm to others in society. An example of this is the case of a person who makes inflammatory and hate-filled comments about a particular group of people on a public platform, such as social media. While this person has the right to express their opinion, their comments could incite violence and contribute to a hostile atmosphere towards the targeted group. In such cases, the person may face the consequences of his actions, such as criticism, loss of employment opportunities, or even legal action if the comments amount to a criminal offense."
Tsinghua,cmv-128,"I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the standard, which is the freezer on the bottom and the fridge on top. This is confusing, and it seems that it will be impossible to find a place for the freezer. How can I change this? A: The refrigerator and freezer is typically fixed on the wall, so you can't put them in any other position. If you don't like the placement of the freezer, you could ask the seller to install a small refrigerator in a closet somewhere. This is what I would do. A: You can't. The refrigerator and freezer are typically mounted to the wall. It is usually mounted on a ledge with a handle so that you can reach it. You can't move it to another position. A: The fridgefreezer unit is a unit of itself. It cannot be moved."
BigScience,cmv-128,"I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the conventional refrigerator where they switch positions. I bought a bottle of wine at Costco today, which was supposed to be replaced by my new Frigidaire but it is in the freezer's storage compartment. That said, if you absolutely must have something in your fridge when it's cold outside (which it sounds like you do) then an insulated cooler would work well for electric-powered fridges; one can easily plug them directly in the outlet rather than running the compressor - they're usually inexpensive enough too! The only real issue I've seen reported recently seems to be about keeping foods fresh or frozen long term: My six-year-old used up all her yogurt this morning! It had been two days since we purchased it so I'm wondering whether there will actually still be good quality yoghurt left after three more days? The instructions say store at room temperature. (I know older children generally don't use their food containers quite so carefully.) Yogurts are not really stored under controlled conditions over longer periods. They are made from fermented milk proteins so nothing stays ""perfect"" forever. And although most strains certainly produce proteinase enzymes capable of breaking down some whey proteins, these do not last very long either once produced, and may disappear during fermentation itself due to the high pH levels associated with active growth bacteria. The first thing to keep in mind is: how did the product get here, any indication what its original contents were? If you're going to make sure you've got plenty left before the expiration date expires, simply put an extra carton in the fridge afterwards, or freeze the rest. A: To me, the dilemma comes down to: Will it spoil quickly? If yes, you want to preserve it. This requires using proper packaging materials such as vacuum-sealed bags or jars. For example, ice cream flavors tend to ""stay"" better sealed in the freezer that way they'll continue changing flavor slowly without being exposed to air. There might also be benefits to storing flavours separately from each other. (One study found that different varieties of strawberry-flavored drink could age differently.) I think there's less thinking about brews because beer isn't particularly likely to go bad quickly, especially in cool temperatures. On the flip side, here's another example: Lots of people buy bread instead of letting it rise overnight. A lot of bread stores suggest leaving out partially baked loaves uncovered until completely cooled, for a couple hours."
LLAMA,cmv-128,"I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the more typical configuration of the freezer on the bottom and the fridge on top. What are the benefits and drawbacks of each configuration? The main reason you'll find the freezer on the bottom is to keep it insulated from the fridge above it. Because the freezer is generally colder than the fridge, there's a natural tendency for the cold air to fall from the freezer to the fridge, which is usually not what you want. The freezer on top doesn't really suffer from this problem, because the cold air doesn't fall from the top of the fridge into the freezer, so it doesn't need to be insulated from it. As you can see from the picture, if the freezer is on the bottom, it needs to be insulated from the fridge, which isn't necessary if the freezer is on top. In some cases, you may find the freezer on top is less convenient because you need to reach higher, but in the case of the refrigerator pictured here, it's actually easier to use.

I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. On the one hand, it's nice to be able to see everything in the fridge at once, without having to bend over. On the other hand, it's a little bit harder to reach things in the back of the freezer. I've been doing some research on the pros and cons of top-freezer vs. bottom-freezer refrigerators, and it seems like there are a few things to consider. Pros of top-freezer refrigerators:  Easier to see everything in the fridge at once.  Less bending over required to access items in the fridge.  May be more energy-efficient than bottom-freezer refrigerators. Cons of top-freezer refrigerators:  Harder to reach items in the back of the freezer.  May be more difficult to organize items in the freezer.  May be more difficult to access items in the freezer while cooking. Ultimately, the best way to decide which type of refrigerator is right for you is to try out both types and see which one you prefer. If you're not sure, you can always ask a friend or family member who has a top-freezer refrigerator if you can take a look at theirs. Here are some additional tips for living with a top-freezer refrigerator:  Keep frequently used items in the front of the fridge so that you don't have to dig through everything to find them.  Use clear containers to organize items in the freezer so that you can easily see what's inside.  If you have trouble reaching items in the back of the freezer, use a step stool or ladder to get a better view.

Human,cmv-128,"I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the opposite, which is what I had at the last place I lived. My reasons for arguing that freezer on bottom is superior are several: 1. 90 of the time you will be interacting with the fridge, not the freezer, so it makes sense to have it eye level. When the fridge is on the bottom of the unit and not the top, most average-sized people have to bend down to see what's inside, which is less than ideal. 2. Freezer on bottom allows you to make use of a sliding drawers arrangement like [this] rather than an open door arrangement like [this.] The former arrangement gives you greater access to more shelf space, since you will never have to reach around something to get at something else at the back of the freezer, you can just slide the drawer out and grab it off the top. 3. If the power goes out, you want the things that need to stay the coldest to be on the bottom. Heat rises, and so it makes sense to keep the frozen items on the bottom so that if your power goes out, they will stay cold the longest. [See uNaturalSelectorX's comment.] Hello, users of CMV!

BigScience,cmv-129,"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually pretty much rich or middle class, and they also often get more help on their homework than those that go public.

My youngest daughter has been bullied since she went to preschool- although she's had many wonderful experiences as well... The lack of diversity isn't really unique to California though. I've heard about this throughout other states too. Human nature certainly plays an important factor here, especially when you consider our Greatest Generation attitude toward laborers and immigrants, etc., things we still struggle with today.

LLAMA,cmv-129,"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually from the more wealthy families of an area. The kids who go to public schools are usually from the less wealthy families. The kids who go to private school are taught that they are better than the kids who go to public school. No, I don't believe in them. I went to private school for 13 years, and the only thing I got out of it was a massive student debt (which I'm still paying off at 22). The teachers were a mixed bunch, a few great ones and a few absolutely terrible ones. I also found the school to be very cliquey, so in the end my only friends were the ones who started out in public school and then switched to private. I'm not saying that private school is awful, because it's not. But I just don't believe that it offers enough benefits to warrant the cost. I would much rather my child have a quality education. In some cases, public schools don't offer a quality education. For example, the public school my daughter attended had a rating of D in the school grade for the state. She was in the 3rd grade and struggling. She was falling behind. It took a 3 week tutoring course for her to catch up. I had to place her in a private school. She went from a D school to an A school. She is doing excellent in school. There are many public schools that are great. But if the public school your child attends is a failing school, I think it's better to send them to a private school. I can't say I agree with you at all. I am a product of private school, so I can't say that I agree with you. I went to a private school for 13 years and loved every single minute of it. I received an amazing education, was taught how to be a well rounded, caring individual, and made friendships that will last a lifetime. I personally believe that it is up to the individual and their parents. Even though I went to a private school, I grew up in a single parent family and my mother and I weren't the wealthiest people. She was able to make it work for me and I will forever be thankful for that. No I don't think it is important to send a child to private school. I believe that the home life is more important then where you are sent for school. I have always been a product of public school and I have been very successful in life and my children are also very successful. If the parents are not educated in order to help with the childs homework and do not push the child to succeed in school, then the child will not succeed. The school does not really matter as much as the parents do. No, I don't believe private schools are that much better than public. I think the quality of education comes more from the teachers and the parents involvement. The parents are the main ones that can make a big difference in the success of their child's education. There are a lot of public school teachers that are just as good as private school teachers. I think the education you get in school depends on the teacher. There are excellent teachers in public schools and in private schools. I know people who went to public school who are very successful. I think that the amount of money you spend on a child's education does not matter as much as the involvement of the parents. My child has been in public school her entire school career. She is 22 and has had her share of ups and downs. I have always been involved with my child's school. I attended the open houses, teacher conferences, and even the PTA meetings. I think the involvement of the parent helps the child succeed in school. I think that a child who has an involved parent will succeed more than a child who does not have an involved parent. No, I do not think private school is important. I do not think private school is important. I have never seen any benefits to it.

Tsinghua,cmv-129,I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually not as good as the ones that go to public schools. Even in elite public schools the children do not learn the same thing as the ones who go to private schools. The difference between the two is not as big as people make it out to be. So what does it do? It creates a social caste system. It creates inequality between the poor and the rich. It creates a lot of kids that go to private schools that end up in the same place as the kids who go to public schools. The only difference is that the kids who go to private schools will end up working for a private school and the kids who go to public schools will end up working for the government. So you are creating a class system and in this day and age it does not make sense. If you want to create a class system go ahead but make sure you do it in a way that you don't have to discriminate against the people who are less fortunate than you. And if you want to create a social inequality system go ahead but make sure you don't make a difference between the kids that are going to work for you and the kids that are going to work for the government. The only difference between the two is the way that they will end up living their lives. And for those that say that you don't have to go to private school to become a successful person go ahead and live your life like that. You will be successful but you will not be happy. What you want is a happy life. I want to be happy. So that's what I am going to do. I am not going to let my kids go to private school because I want to give them a chance to have a successful life. I want them to have a chance to have a happy life. I want them to be happy.
PaLM,cmv-129,"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually from wealthy families and have a head start on their education. They have access to better teachers, resources, and opportunities than kids from public schools. This creates a cycle of inequality where kids from wealthy families are more likely to succeed than kids from poor families. There are a few arguments in favor of private schools. Some people say that they provide a better education than public schools. They argue that private schools have more resources and can afford to hire better teachers. They also say that private schools are more flexible and can cater to the needs of individual students. However, I believe that the benefits of private schools are outweighed by the disadvantages. Private schools create social inequality and make it harder for kids from poor families to succeed. They also tend to be more exclusive and can create a sense of elitism. I believe that all children should have access to the same quality of education regardless of their family's income. Public schools are the best way to ensure that all children have a fair chance to succeed. Here are some specific examples of how private schools create social inequality:  Private schools are more expensive than public schools. This means that only kids from wealthy families can afford to attend private schools. This creates a divide between kids from wealthy families and kids from poor families.  Private schools have more resources than public schools. This means that private schools can offer more opportunities to their students. They can afford to hire better teachers, have smaller class sizes, and offer more extracurricular activities. This gives kids from private schools an advantage over kids from public schools.  Private schools are more exclusive than public schools. This means that private schools are more likely to accept students from wealthy families and reject students from poor families. This creates a sense of elitism among private school students. They may feel that they are better than public school students. I believe that the disadvantages of private schools outweigh the benefits. Private schools create social inequality, make it harder for kids from poor families to succeed, and tend to be more exclusive. I believe that all children should have access to the same quality of education regardless of their family's income. Public schools are the best way to ensure that all children have a fair chance to succeed."
LLAMA,cmv-130,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by a utilitarian criterion of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In other words, every human action, and every human institution, must be justified by a ""means-end"" rationality that justifies its existence only if it provides the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Now, we can't really blame the Enlightenment for the advent of hyper-rationality, because it was during this period in human history that the liberating influence of human reason was given its due. After centuries of a worldview that was based on fear, superstition, and a general sense of powerlessness, Enlightenment thinkers were able to break free of the shackles of irrationality and a fear of the unknown. The Enlightenment, in this sense, was a breath of fresh air. But the Enlightenment thinkers tended to go too far, to take human reason to be the only way of knowing reality, and to apply it to every area of life. And, as a result, the Enlightenment gave rise to a form of hyper-rationality that tended to flatten out all of reality and to undermine the notion of a transcendent moral order. Hyper-rationality is one of the reasons why the Enlightenment is no longer en vogue in the minds of philosophers and scientists, and why many postmodern thinkers are so critical of the Enlightenment. Postmodern thinkers have sought to deconstruct the arrogance of hyper-rationality, and to recover a sense of the importance of transcendence. Now, I am not a postmodern thinker. But I do think that postmodern thinkers are right in their criticism of hyper-rationality. But, in this essay, I am not primarily concerned with a philosophical critique of hyper-rationality, but with how hyper-rationality has had a corrupting influence on our economic system. Hyper-rationality has led to an economic system in which the values of efficiency and productivity have taken precedence over the value of human beings. When we are told to conform our actions to the highest level of efficiency, and to the greatest productivity, we are also told to conform to a system that is designed to maximize the bottom line and to squeeze every last ounce of productivity out of every worker. This is why the American worker has been working harder and harder, for longer and longer hours, for less and less money. The American worker has been squeezed dry by a system that views workers as mere cogs in a machine whose only purpose is to be as productive as possible, so that the greatest amount of money can be made for those who control the means of production. And the sad fact is that the American worker is now working harder and harder, for longer and longer hours, for less and less money, to make a handful of people extraordinarily rich. Now, I want to be clear about something. I am not advocating socialism. I am not even advocating social democracy. I am a free market capitalist. I do believe that the free market is the best way to generate wealth. But I also believe that the free market must be regulated. And I believe that the government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of its people. And I don't believe that the free market should be allowed to be so free that it can become a mechanism that exploits the many for the benefit of the few. What I am advocating is what some economists have called ""humane capitalism."" What is humane capitalism? Humane capitalism is an economic system that is based on a sense of fairness and justice. It is based on a respect for human beings, and on the understanding that there are some things that are more important than money. Humane capitalism is not hyper-rational. It does not demand that all human actions and all human institutions be teologically justified by a utilitarian criterion of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It does not demand that the bottom line always be the bottom line. It does not demand that the most efficient and productive course of action be the only course of action. Humane capitalism recognizes that, as human beings, we are more than just cogs in a machine. We are not just means to an end. We are also ends in ourselves. And this means that the value of a human being cannot be measured in terms"
BigScience,cmv-130,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by appealing to a higher authority, most often God or universal moral principle. I don't think there's anything new in this notion of ""justifying"" actions through their religious bases; it was long ago codified as part of Catholicism (see Thomas Aquinas) and will continue to haunt our society into posterity: ""It can hardly be doubted but for many individuals who are not truly educated and conscious they would act much more wisely if they were led by mere tradition than themselves lead them... It is true that men have sometimes acted justly without any such habitation [habitus], yet still we see from experience how far recourse to custom has tended frequently toward virtue.

Tsinghua,cmv-130,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by reason. The teologies most associated with this tendency are Marxism, Pragmatism, and Islamism. What I am going to do is briefly show how these three are interrelated, how they work, and how they relate to one another. Marxism: The idea that all humans are engaged in class struggle and that the most important determinant of their actions is their economic class. The view that man is motivated by class interest. The view that one's interest in working to promote one's class interests is a universal truth that does not require any further justification. The view that one's class interests can be justified only by reason. The view that every human action must be teologically justified by reason.

While sitting in a tea room, a radical young man approached him and asked him a very strange question. ""You are a professor of philosophy, and you are giving a lecture on the nature of man. Do you believe that man is motivated by his economic class?"" ""Absolutely!"" Marx replied. ""So you think that all human action is motivated by class interest?"" ""Yes, absolutely."" ""Well, I have a very strange question for you."
OpenAI,cmv-130,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by logic, reason and quantitative analysis. It is the belief that emotions, intuition, and subjective experiences are inferior to logic and reasoning, and that everything must be analyzed through a ""rational lens."" As a helpful assistant, I can provide you with tips on how to deal with situations when you encounter hyper-rationality: 1. Acknowledge the value of logic and reason but also recognize the importance of emotions and subjective experiences. Encourage an open-minded approach that acknowledges the value of different perspectives. 2. Highlight the limitations of relying solely on logic and reason. Remind others that sometimes, we need to trust our intuition and emotions for decision making, especially in interpersonal or complex situations. 3. Ask questions that help unpack underlying values and assumptions. This can help to expose some of the biases that may be driving hyper-rationality. 4. Emphasize empathy and compassion. Encourage others to consider the needs, desires, and experiences of others, rather than relying solely on quantifiable data. 5. Finally, be patient and continue to have respectful dialogue. Understand that working against hyper-rationality is a process that requires time and effort. Encourage others to think critically and consider the balance between logic and intuition in their lives."
Human,cmv-130,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring. In my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain. Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. I present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true. However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culturerationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). In conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct. 1. 2. 3. reddit.comraww 4. Hello, users of CMV!

PaLM,cmv-130,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by a rational argument. In other words, hyper-rationality is the belief that all human behavior must be able to be explained by reason and logic. Hyper-rationality is a relatively new phenomenon that has arisen in the wake of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and philosophical ferment that began in the 17th century and lasted until the end of the 18th century. During the Enlightenment, thinkers began to question traditional religious beliefs and authority, and they argued that reason and logic should be the basis for all human knowledge. The Enlightenment had a profound impact on Western culture, and its legacy is still felt today. One of the most important legacies of the Enlightenment is the idea of hyper-rationality. This idea has become so pervasive in Western culture that it is often taken for granted. However, hyper-rationality is a problematic concept. It is based on the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by reason and logic. This assumption is false, as there are many aspects of human behavior that are not rational. For example, emotions, intuition, and instincts are all important factors in human decision-making, but they cannot be explained by reason and logic. The belief in hyper-rationality can lead to a number of problems. One problem is that it can lead to a lack of empathy. If people believe that all human behavior can be explained by reason and logic, then they may be less likely to understand or sympathize with people who make decisions that they do not agree with. This can lead to conflict and division. Another problem with hyper-rationality is that it can lead to a lack of creativity. If people believe that all human behavior must be rational, then they may be less likely to take risks or try new things. This can stifle innovation and creativity. The idea of hyper-rationality is a seductive one. It appeals to our desire to understand the world around us. However, it is important to remember that human behavior is complex and cannot always be explained by reason and logic. When we try to force everything into a rational framework, we lose sight of the things that make us human. We need to find a balance between reason and emotion, logic and intuition. We need to be able to understand the world around us, but we also need to be able to appreciate the things that cannot be explained."
PaLM,cmv-131,"I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately condemn Caitlyn for her transition. I think it's important to remember that Caitlyn Jenner is a human being, and she deserves to be treated with respect. Just because she transitioned doesn't mean that she's any less of a woman. She is still the same person she was before, and she deserves to be accepted for who she is. I also think it's important to remember that people who transition are not doing it for attention. They are doing it because they feel like they need to in order to live their lives authentically. It's a difficult and often painful process, and it's not something that people do lightly. I think the media and the public need to do a better job of understanding transgender people. We need to stop making assumptions about them and we need to start listening to their stories. We need to create a more inclusive society where everyone feels safe and accepted. I'm glad that Caitlyn Jenner is using her platform to raise awareness about transgender issues. She is a role model for many people, and she is helping to change the way that society views transgender people. I hope that one day, people will be able to transition without fear of judgment or discrimination. I hope that one day, everyone will be able to live their lives authentically, without fear of being rejected."

Hypocrisy can be frustrating to deal with because it can feel like people are sending mixed messages and not being genuine. One way to address this is to have open and honest conversations with those individuals, and try to understand their perspectives and where they may be coming from. It's important to approach these conversations with empathy and respect, even if you disagree with them.

Tsinghua,cmv-131,"I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately saying that they didn't think she was ""really trans"" because she wasn't transgender. Honestly, I didn't find any of this shocking. I have known people to whom this has happened, and it's something that people get confused about. They can be at the same time pro-trans and anti-trans. And I think it's very important to point that out, because it's part of what's going on with the transphobia in the culture right now. The other thing that I think is really important is the issue of the trans narrative and who gets to tell it. I know that there are people who are just really, really adamant about the idea that trans people should have their own narrative. That's something that I've been trying to talk about with people in my community, and I've gotten some pushback on that, but I've also gotten a lot of support for that idea. And I think that's a really important thing to talk about. RELATED: 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show': Kiki and Herb Discuss Transgender Rights at GLAAD Media Awards That's a great point. I think that is something that a lot of people are really, really interested in, and I think it's really important to talk about it. Because it's not just about what trans people should have, it's also about how trans people should have it. And what kind of narrative they should have. And I think that's really important to talk about. You mentioned earlier that you were involved in an organization called Young Voices, which is all about the rights of young trans people. How did that organization get started? What was your role in that? I got involved with Young Voices when I was a sophomore in high school. I was already active in the trans community, but I wasn't as involved in the GLBT community as I am now. And when I was in high school, I started working with this organization called Youth Out, which is an organization that has a lot of focus on youth empowerment. And it's an organization that I started in high school, and it's still around today. And I was doing some research with Youth Out on the right to vote for young trans people, and I was working with them on the initiative to get a trans person on the ballot for the state of Colorado. And then I got involved with Young Voices after I was working with Youth Out on the trans voter initiative. I went to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force National Youth Summit, and there was this amazing presentation about young trans people, and it was just this great talk about how trans youth are facing all these issues that trans people have faced for years, but trans youth are facing them now. And that really resonated with me, because it was just talking about the things that I was already doing in my life. It was talking about things that I was already doing in my life, but it was also talking about how trans youth were doing it. And that really, really resonated with me. So I started working with them, and that's when I was really, really interested in youth empowerment. And it's just been an amazing organization to work with. RELATED: 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show': Kiki and Herb Discuss Transgender Rights at GLAAD Media Awards It's a really cool organization, and I love the fact that they're talking about the rights of young trans people. They're really looking at the rights of trans youth. It's a really important issue for them. They're working to ensure that trans youth have the right to vote, and they're also working to ensure that trans youth have the right to education. And they're working to ensure that trans youth have the right to health care. It's just so cool to see them working on these things. You mentioned earlier that you have worked on the trans youth voter initiative, which is an initiative in Colorado. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Can you tell us a little bit about the initiative that you worked on with Youth Out? Well, I think it's important to talk about that, because I think that's something that people don't really talk about. I think that trans youth are facing these issues, and I think it's really important to talk about them, and I think it's important to know that trans youth are facing these issues. And I think it's important to talk about the things that trans youth are doing, and I think it's important to talk about the things that trans youth are doing in the community, and I think it's important to talk about the things that trans youth are doing to fight back against transphobia in the community."

I felt both stories where instances of fluidity. One was on Gender Fluidity, the other being Ethnic Fluidity. Assuming Rachael actually feels much more comfortable as a black woman, I don't see why she should not be one. I understand that it might be seen as an unfair comparison to say a sex change has the same weight as an ethnic change, but I can't help but think this decision on who we can and cannot be should not rest on society, but rather on ourselves. If we allow this, then perhaps we would see questions of ""yes you have decided to be a girl, but are you the right kind of girl?"" or ""you believe to be a christian, but are you the right kind of christian? Oh, you are transferring from being a Buddhist? No, you can't do that, religion and spirituality isn't for you to decide."" Now I know that these particular examples the best in this circumstance, but I guess I'm trying to get at what happens when we have society decide what is the ""right kind"" of race for you to be.

This morning, I posted this quote on my Instagram that I found and thought was very inspirational and uplifting. Jaden has been known to be a bit of a ""free spirit,"" so to speak. He has taken many risks when it comes to fashion and has often been spotted in dresses and skirts. He also starred in a Louis Vuitton ad for their SpringSummer 2016 men's line. The funny thing is that this ad was not met with the same amount of criticism that the women's line has faced. While some people have come out to support him, others have not. For example, one person tweeted, ""Jaden Smith in a dress for a Louis Vuitton ad is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen."" I'm trying to figure out what is so disturbing about a person wearing a dress? I think the world needs to understand that a person's choice of attire does not affect you. The way Jaden dresses does not affect you or your way of life. This is exactly why Jaden's fashion decisions shouldn't matter. However, it is a big deal because this is a huge step for men's fashion.

BigScience,cmv-132,"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a lack of confidence in one's own abilities rather than true understanding. Many times I've seen people post things like ""I'll never play WoW or World Of Warcraft"" with no reasoning as to why they won't ever do it anymore. No matter how well-versed you are about WoW (which by all accounts you've been), there will always be something missing that's preventing you from playing the game ""just right."" If you're not willing to shed light on what exactly stops you from enjoying your time spent at Azeroth, then don't expect anyone else to help you find out what's going wrong. As another example, one of my friends posted recently: ""Never have time to do anything but work"" while discussing his life situation. That's pretty much the definition of lazy IMO; he's clearly making excuses instead of offering solutions which he could see would solve more problems than justifying such behavior. (In fact, I'd argue that if he has any real desire to succeed, he'd put effort into improving himself so that he can become successful regardless of whether it's easy or difficult.) As well, when we talk about dorky pastimes like Minecraft and other similar games, some people actually downright dislike them because they're considered too trivial andor pointless, yet still insist upon pursuing them despite their initial antipathy towards them. To say nothing of the questionable ethics underpinning our society's emphasis on gamers being ""motivated"" only to achieve commercial success. So now I'm wondering what the problem really is: Are we expected to believe players who claim they hate certain activities simply because of personal preferences? Or should those same players accept responsibility for finding ways around these desires because ""if they didn't want to spend their free time doing something productive they'd better figure out alternatives soon!""? Just to clarify - I'm not saying there's necessarily anything inherently wrong with someone actively seeking to thrive in whatever field they choose. But obviously everyone cannot fulfill every potential talent head-on due to circumstances beyond their control, and in order to remain grounded even amidst such disappointments, some form of acceptance must first come alongside self-love and self-acceptance.

However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a ""free speechminded anti-censorship attitude. As a frequent visitor to the sub, I have noticed a lot of posts in which some group (usually a minor one) is speaking up about some wrongs they've been subject to, but the other side isn't allowed to respond. As an example, a user who has long been vocal about the issues with abuse on Reddit (and, by extension, social media in general) was recently banned from a subreddit that had nothing to do with any of his posts. His account was blocked without warning or explanation. When he asked why, he was told that he was violating the rules. This happened to him on a subreddit that had nothing to do with his posts. I believe this happened because of a trend of sub mods banning people for posts about social issues, rather than for violations of the subreddit's rules. I believe that it's possible to be pro-free speech while still being pro-responsible speech. I don't believe the two can be separated. I believe that any individual who is banned from a subreddit should have the right to defend themselves in the subreddit, even if they are being punished for discussing an issue in which they believe their rights have been violated. Is this a reasonable stance? Is this something that is being practiced in the subreddit? If so, how? If not, what do you think the rules should be for subreddits in this case? I'm not sure if this is a duplicate of a similar question, but I'm not sure what's being asked in that one. I'm interested in this specific case, but I'm not sure what other information might be relevant. A: I think the main point is that if you ban someone for something they say in a non-minoritarian subreddit, then you should also be able to ban them from a more-minoritarian subreddit. I don't see any way around that, and I don't think there's a need to separate the two. The reason for this is that there's a difference between a moderator and a mod: A moderator can suspend someone for posting something that is clearly and demonstrably bad, but a mod cannot. A mod can moderate a subreddit to avoid the worst of the bad speech, but a mod cannot ban someone for speech that is arguably not bad. There's no reason to try to do both at the same time. In practice, this is not a problem: There are a lot of subreddits where I think the mods are trying to moderate by banning certain speech andor making it impossible for certain users to post. (For example, the mods of the rFeministHacking subreddit.) There are a lot of subreddits where I think the mods are trying to moderate by moderating what the moderators think is bad speech, and making it possible for users to post things they don't like. (For example, the mods of the rHumanist subreddit.) I'm not sure how to explain the difference, but I think it's because the former is less effective at suppressing the speech, while the latter is more effective at controlling the users. But the same principle applies to the former and the latter. I think the main issue with banning someone for something they say in a non-minoritarian subreddit is that the user might not have any way to defend themselves. But this is also true of the mods who ban them. If you ban someone for saying something in a non-minoritarian subreddit, they should be able to respond in a non-minoritarian subreddit. (For example, if the mods of the rHumanist subreddit ban someone for saying something in the rFeministHacking subreddit, then the mods of the rFeministHacking subreddit should be able to ban them for saying something in the rHumanist subreddit.)"

Is there something wrong with being able-bodied? Is my issue just due more towards self deprecation over things like body image issues rather then anything else such as IQintelligence etc.? For example if someone was obese they would still have some minor negative connotations associated but otherwise are considered normal people so why do you think differently when talking instead around disability related concepts... It feels kindof awkward asking questions because on one hand what brought us all together should make common ground easier yet also raises obvious concerns through 'what exactly am i getting myself into'.

PaLM,cmv-132,"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a place of insecurity. I understand that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and that's what makes this subreddit so valuable. However, I often find myself wondering if some of the posts are simply a way for people to validate their own insecurities. For example, I've seen a number of posts where people ask if they're ""too old"" to start a new career, or if they're ""too fat"" to lose weight. These are valid questions, but I can't help but feel that they're often asked in a way that's designed to elicit a specific response. For example, the person who asks if they're ""too old"" to start a new career is likely hoping for someone to tell them that they're not too old and that they should go for it. The person who asks if they're ""too fat"" to lose weight is likely hoping for someone to tell them that they're not too fat and that they can do it. I'm not saying that these people don't deserve support. Of course they do. But I think it's important to be aware of the fact that some of these posts may be motivated by insecurity. If you're feeling insecure about something, it's important to remember that you're not alone. Everyone feels insecure sometimes. And it's okay to ask for help. But it's also important to be realistic about your goals and to remember that you can achieve anything you set your mind to. If you're looking for support, there are a number of resources available to you. You can talk to your friends and family, or you can join a support group. There are also a number of online resources available, such as websites and blogs. Remember, you're not alone. And you can achieve anything you set your mind to."

However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth. Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind. I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as'stupid' (that'd be the first page of'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view. I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first. P.S.

LLAMA,cmv-133,"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this is my opinion on the matter. It will be broken into sections. 1. What is a Panther? I believe the Panther is an all around weapon that is meant to stay around the center of the battlefield. I believe the Panther should be used as a weapon that you can engage enemies at any range and be effective. The longer ranges the less effective, but still able to keep enemies from crossing the halfway line. I believe the Panther needs a good gun that can pen at any range, a good rate of fire, and good mobility. I think the gun is a good gun, but I think it can be improved. I feel that penetration and damage is good. I feel that the gun needs to have a higher ROF. I feel like the gun is a little too slow, and I feel the Panther needs a faster ROF. I think that the Panther is pretty good at all ranges, but I believe that the gun needs to be improved at longer ranges to be able to be effective. I feel that the penetration, damage, and rate of fire of the gun is good, but not good enough. I feel that the speed of the Panther is great. I believe that the Panther should be able to get in and out of engagements quickly and be able to maneuver around the battlefield. I feel that the maneuverability of the Panther is great.

I believe that the Panther should be able to take some hits, but not too many. I feel that the signal range is good. I believe that the Panther should be able to communicate with other tanks around it. 2. This is the section that I am going to change my mind on. I had a hard time coming up with what I wanted to say in this section, so I am going to just give my thoughts and take notes on how it can be improved. I feel that the gun needs to be improved.

PaLM,cmv-133,"I am not sure that I can change your view on this. It seems like you have thought about it a lot and have come to a conclusion that you are happy with. However, I can offer a different perspective that you might not have considered. First, I think it is important to define what we mean by ""good"" and ""bad"". In this context, I think we can agree that ""good"" means something that is beneficial to the individual or society, and ""bad"" means something that is harmful to the individual or society. Now, let's think about the specific case of lying. Is lying always bad? No, I don't think so. There are times when lying can be beneficial to the individual or society. For example, if a child is being bullied, it might be helpful for them to lie to the bully in order to protect themselves. Or, if a doctor is treating a patient, it might be necessary for them to lie to the patient in order to protect the patient's health. Of course, there are also times when lying is harmful. For example, if a person lies to their spouse about an affair, it can damage the relationship and cause a lot of pain. Or, if a politician lies to their constituents about their policies, it can undermine trust and lead to bad decisions. So, the answer to the question of whether lying is always bad is no. There are times when lying can be beneficial, and there are times when it is harmful. The key is to weigh the potential benefits and harms of lying in each particular situation and make a decision accordingly. Now, let's talk about the specific case of lying to children. I think there are a few things to consider here. First, children are more vulnerable to the effects of lying than adults. They are more likely to believe what they are told, and they are more likely to be harmed by the lies that they are told. Second, children are still developing their moral sense, and they need to learn the difference between right and wrong. Lying can interfere with this development. Third, lying can damage the trust between a parent and a child. This trust is essential for a healthy parent-child relationship. For all of these reasons, I think it is generally best to avoid lying to children. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if a child is being bullied, it might be necessary to lie to the bully in order to protect the child. Or, if a child is asking about a sensitive topic, it might be necessary to lie to the child in order to protect the child's innocence. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to lie to a child is a difficult one. There are no easy answers. However, I think it is important to weigh the potential benefits and harms of lying carefully before making a decision. In conclusion, I do not think that lying is always bad. However, I do think that it is generally best to avoid lying, especially to children. Lying can be harmful to children, and it can interfere with their development. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, and it is important to weigh the potential benefits and harms of lying carefully before making a decision."

Human,cmv-133,"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained. My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country. I will reflect on my mother's story. She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country. When she came to this country she was on government assistance. With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master's Degree. Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community. I don't need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent's generation, their hard work and sacrifice. I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country. I've read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings. However I don't completely buy into it. I've seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education. As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I'll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do. At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint. As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings. They had no problems acting'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america. That is why I don't have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty. I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story. If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share. TL:DR - The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants. Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians. Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace. However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture. Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue. One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty. But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country. That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today. If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture? Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following: 1) That current poor black culture is a result of systemic discrimination. 2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans. 3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim. 4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited 5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now."

I think that it is wrong to take away their freedom and to use them for our own benefit. I know that some people argue that eating meat is natural and that humans have been doing it for thousands of years. However, I believe that just because something is natural does not mean that it is right. Slavery was once natural, but we now know that it is wrong. Similarly, I believe that it is wrong to treat animals as commodities and to use them for our own purposes. I also believe that eating a plant-based diet is better for our health. Studies have shown that people who eat a vegetarian or vegan diet have a lower risk of heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. In addition, a plant-based diet is better for the environment. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and deforestation.

Human,cmv-134,"I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts. When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could. I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general. I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit. As of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good at peace with myself,'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant. I'm 100 convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as ""vegan"" as possible in the future (I hate this whole ""vegan"" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem. I know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view. On the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add... I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone.... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day.... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all.... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work... For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing.... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing. I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless. I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run. Eventually - not soon, but maybe in a generation or two - I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden. I have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers. Another great argument with links In short, the reality is: It adds up. [Does Veganism Make a Difference?] [Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism] Both of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.

I've never been able to do any kind of pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups or crunches so I can't do a lot of exercises that involve a lot of weight.

BigScience,cmv-135,"Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, regardless of what happened during or after the attack (and thus whether they had any justification). 2. The Japanese who committed these crimes didn't deserve it for Japan to have never been attacked with nuclear weapons. I don't think we can say that either Hitler or Stalin deserved their fate because neither really wanted them, and both two men did quite horrific things beyond those of which even he should have been convicted by history. A: This is essentially the same question as why did he not do such-and-such? Well, there are several reasons. Firstly, one could argue that the US military was responsible for killing over five million people at Hiroshima and Nagasakiwhich is indeed worse than dropping an atom bomb somewhere like Dresden that only killed six hundred. Secondly, the government can also claim that it saw no other choice in order to stop Axis aggression. At one point, Eisenhower said that if his nation ""had resorted to bombing Germany from bases outside Europe...[he] would have done so too"" This concept has become somewhat problematic since it turns out that Nazi leaders and cabinet members knew about plans to use weaponized radiation before the attacks began but compared against some of these measures later taken to limit civilian casualties in France, Belgium etc., it's strange to see how quickly countries made decisions based upon information available to its services when crisis struck. Thirdly, although many Americans found the events horrifying themselves, there's always going to be something irrational about a country being willing to sacrifice tens of thousands of innocent lives simply for self-preservation. It's hard to imagine anyone wanting to go through life believing they're doing evil just because someone else died under circumstances where you believe your governments actions may have caused death andor destruction. Fourthly, perhaps more importantly, the American public consistently supported her president's policies all along. One thing President Truman used to emphasize before the Pearl Harbor decision was that he believed that once the Roosevelt administration decided to enter World War II, he shouldn't get criticized for breaking United States neutrality either way. With the growing threat posed by the Soviet Union beginning in , however, Truman realized needing to take action sooner rather than later as the danger became apparent. Fifthly, while citizens of different nations will typically make different judgements related to wars between adjacent states, civillians generally tend to support national defense first and foremost; hence having a strong commitment to protecting one's own citizenry takes precedence above anything else. In fact, within modern times, most U.S presidents tend to favor taking aggressive foreign policy steps whenever necessary - even without explicit consent from Congress. Thereby assuring that our interests remain protected wherever possible - especially given current events involving China and Iran."

Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, including women and children; the purpose was not military but political - with Hiroshima as an example for Japan's surrender that would lead finally into World War II ending (which also meant it put Germany at risk). 2., 3. 4.: The bombing caused more deaths than had been won by any battle fought during WWII prior or after those bombings took place...and there are numbers available showing who died because they couldn't get medical attention once all things collapsed due partly from depleted uranium used against them causing diseases like cancer which don' stop being lethal till long time AFTER wars have ended! What is needed now? More studies done before another nation holds its own citizens hostage through these deadly weapons while believing their country will never come under such attack again expecting self-defense when most Americans know better since what happened last year kept secret so no one could ask ""why""?!"
Tsinghua,cmv-135,"Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians. The casualties of the Japanese were even worse than those of the American soldiers who died. We were killing civilians, even though we were in the right. The difference between this and the Japanese is that we were killing civilians with the consent of the civilian government. The Japanese were killing civilians without consent. 2. We should never, ever go to war without a declaration of war from Congress. That's why the US Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war. Congress is supposed to decide if we should go to war. We should never go to war without their consent. The reason for this is that Congress has the right to determine the number of troops that are needed to fight a war. If Congress says we need 100,000 troops, and we only need 50,000 troops, that is a violation of the Constitution. The only way to avoid this is for Congress to be wrong about how many troops we need. 3. There is a reason the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war. That reason is so that the executive branch does not have the power to decide if we should go to war. The executive branch has a tendency to decide when we should go to war, based on political or emotional considerations. Congress has the power to declare war so that the executive branch does not have that power. We need to give Congress that power so that the executive branch cannot make war on us without our consent. 4. When the US was at war with the British, we had a constitutional system of government that prevented the executive branch from making war on us without our consent. If the executive branch made war on us without our consent, we could sue the British in a court. We could sue them for violating the Constitution. If the US government is so powerful that the executive branch can make war on us without our consent, we should sue them in a court. We should sue them for violating the Constitution. If the executive branch is so powerful that the executive branch can make war on us without our consent, we should sue them in a court. We should sue them for violating the Constitution. 5. When the US was at war with the British, the Congress was supposed to pass laws to raise money to pay for the war. The executive branch was not supposed to raise money to pay for the war. The Congress was supposed to pass laws to raise money to pay for the war. The executive branch was not supposed to raise money to pay for the war. 6. The President has the power to raise money to pay for the war. He is not supposed to do this. He is supposed to give Congress the power to raise money to pay for the war. 7. We are supposed to have a separation of powers in the US government. The President is not supposed to make war on us. The Congress is not supposed to make war on us. The President is not supposed to make war on us. The Congress is not supposed to make war on us. 8. The Constitution gave the power to make war to Congress. We have no right to make war on the US government. We have no right to make war on the US government. 9. The US government is not allowed to wage war on the US government.

OpenAI,cmv-135,"Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, causing immense and long-lasting damage to entire communities. The use of atomic bombs as a means of warfare sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the principles of humanity and justice. 2. There were alternative options available that could have ended the war without resorting to such extreme measures. For example, the United States could have continued with the blockade of Japan and intensified conventional bombing, which was already causing significant damage to the country's infrastructure. 3. The decision to drop the atomic bombs was not solely based on ending the war, but also had political motivations. The United States wanted to demonstrate its power and send a message to the Soviet Union, which was emerging as a rival superpower at the time. 4. The use of atomic bombs had severe long-term consequences for the environment and health of the people living in the affected areas. The radiation exposure caused cancer rates to skyrocket, and some victims developed lifelong health problems as a result. Overall, the use of atomic bombs on Japan was a senseless act of destruction that caused immense harm to innocent civilians and undermined the values of justice and humanity."
LLAMA,cmv-135,"Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, not on military installations. The American rationale for using the atomic bomb was to save American lives. There was no American ground invasion of Japan planned. The war was already won, and Japan was already defeated. Japan had been cut off from all oil supplies, and it was unable to fly or move its remaining military forces. The Japanese were prepared to surrender. In fact, the Japanese government had already sent out feelers to the American government to try to negotiate a surrender, but the American government wanted to make an example of Japan. 2. The atomic bomb is not a ""weapon of mass destruction."" The atomic bomb is a weapon of extreme mass destruction. 3. The atomic bomb is the most horrifying weapon ever invented by the human species. 4. The atomic bomb is an anti-people weapon. No other weapon has the ability to kill so many people so fast. 5.

Human,cmv-135,"Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly. 2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 911 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.] For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda Co justified in perpetrating 911? No one would say yes. If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000 casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 911 caused 3000 deaths. 3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 911 as well. 4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: ""Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks."" We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction] . At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan."

Tsinghua,cmv-136,"I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. That is not necessarily a good thing. If you have a lot of debt, it affects your future income. It is expensive to live in the US and expensive to live anywhere in the world. It's expensive to move to another country. A lot of people are saddled with debt that they can't get out of, and it has huge impacts on their lives. I'm not really sure what the right answer is, but we should be able to live a decent life. My second biggest concern is the lack of health insurance in the US. Health care is expensive, and you can get pretty sick for a pretty cheap price. I'm not sure how we should solve this problem. I'm not a fan of tort reform. ghaff If you don't like health care in the US, you can try moving to Canada or the UK. The UK is arguably a better system (though I'm not sure that's really the best measure). But in both countries, you're likely to be paying more than you would be in the US, particularly if you have any chronic conditions. srean Well in the UK you have to pay upfront for your health insurance. So if you get ill you pay the whole 2000 pounds and get the insurance for the rest. If you have an accident and you get some type of injuries then you have to pay the whole 2000 pounds and get the insurance for the rest. ghaff If you're young and healthy you're probably paying a lot less than 2000 pounds up front. daniel-cussen It is scary how little the government has accomplished, given how much money it has spent. The only ""success"" has been to have kept the economy growing for a long time, so people can feel better about their situation. But what has really happened? Nothing. It's the most expensive government program of all time. And yet, for some reason, we keep spending more and more money. And the best part is that there's no accountability whatsoever. ekianjo The reason it is scary is because there is no accountability. If you want to see what the real GDP is, you have to subtract all the pork projects, and even then, it's still an underestimation. You can argue that the current government is the most efficient in history, but they are the first one that can't be compared with the previous ones, since they spend a lot of money without any sign of a real ""success."" And as we all know, there is no real evidence that you can build a country by spending a lot of money. It's like buying a Ferrari to impress people, and it's very well made, but you still don't get where you want to go. jacquesm The reason it is scary is because there is no accountability. No accountability is an upside of a democratic system. ekianjo It's a very dangerous upside, especially when the money spent is much higher than in any other democracy, and with no sign of ""repaying."" georgemcbay The state has long been on a steady path of decentralization, even before decentralization became a hot-button political issue. The system has been increasing in efficiency and decreasing in cost for decades. The price of electricity per kWh in the US has been dropping steadily since 1980, while the price of electricity per kWh in Germany has risen steadily. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't find that a particularly compelling argument for ""decentralization."" Electricity is an interesting case in that while it's still largely a centralized industry, there is a great deal of decentralization taking place, in the form of micro-grids, micro- distribution systems, and local renewable generation. But if we look at something like air conditioning, where the ""decentralized"" approach has the most potential to increase efficiency, the situation is very different. There is no decentralization going on at all in this area. In fact, the centralized approach is the most efficient way to go, and the centralization has already been there for decades, and is likely to continue for decades more. In fact, this is an area where the US is actually more centralized than most of the rest of the world. pjlegato You're not looking at the price per kWh in a vacuum. You're looking at the price of electricity."

College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. I definitely understand your concern. The rising national debt is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted solution. One potential solution for student loan debt is to advocate for policies that lower the cost of tuition and provide more funding for higher education. Additionally, encouraging individuals to pursue careers in fields that offer student loan forgiveness programs could provide relief for those struggling with student loan debt. It's important to stay informed and engaged in political discussions to advocate for solutions that benefit individuals and society as a whole."
LLAMA,cmv-136,"I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. And so what do you get when you make loans too easy to obtain? You get an increasing number of students who will never be able to pay them back. And what happens when they can't pay them back? They get a free pass. And who pays for that? The taxpayers, who are not necessarily the people who got the degrees in the first place. A politician's job is to address these concerns, but instead of talking about the rising national debt, we've got one candidate who wants to give people free healthcare and another who wants to build a wall. The wall idea is so preposterous that I don't really need to go into it, but I will say that the idea that we are going to make Mexico pay for the wall is even more ridiculous. The only way that we are going to pay for this wall is if we take it out of our own pockets. The universal healthcare idea is not as preposterous as the wall idea. The idea that we can somehow give healthcare to everyone is not as impossible as the idea that we are going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. It's not impossible, but it is incredibly risky and unnecessary. So, let's talk about the rising national debt. Specifically student loans."
PaLM,cmv-136,"I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. Students are being told they need to go to college to get a good job, but they don't realize the financial burden they're taking on. The average student loan debt is now over $30,000, and that number is only going to get higher. There are a few things that need to be done to address this problem. First, we need to make college more affordable. This could be done by increasing government subsidies, providing more financial aid, or lowering the cost of tuition. Second, we need to make it harder for students to take out loans. This could be done by raising interest rates, requiring cosigners, or limiting the amount of money that students can borrow. Finally, we need to educate students about the financial consequences of taking out student loans. This could be done through high school financial literacy courses, college financial aid counseling, or by providing more information on the internet. I know that addressing this problem won't be easy, but it's important that we do something. The rising cost of college is a major burden on students and their families, and it's only going to get worse if we don't take action. Here are a few specific examples of how the rising cost of college is affecting students:  The average student loan debt is now over $30,000. This means that students are graduating from college with a significant financial burden. This debt can make it difficult for students to buy a home, start a family, or save for retirement.  Students are taking longer to pay off their loans. The average student loan repayment period is now over 20 years. This means that students are spending a significant portion of their lives paying off their loans.  Students are struggling to make their loan payments. Many students are unable to make their loan payments on time, which can lead to late fees, interest charges, and even default. The rising cost of college is a serious problem, and it's one that we need to address. By taking action to make college more affordable and by educating students about the financial consequences of taking out student loans, we can help to ensure that future generations of students are not burdened with this debt. In addition to the financial burden, the rising cost of college is also having a negative impact on the quality of education. As colleges and universities raise their tuition rates, they are forced to cut back on course offerings, faculty, and student services. This means that students are getting a less comprehensive and less personalized education. The rising cost of college is a major problem that is affecting students, families, and the economy. We need to take action to address this problem before it gets worse."

If I hadn't been able to get a 100k loan, I wouldn't be 100k in debt right now. I would've gone to a state school, and eventually appreciated that fact once I became more emotionally mature. Parents have a hard time letting their kid get a tattoo, but they let you get a HUGE loan on what is right now a big gamble? Please. Now, why is that relevant? Well, the economy IS doing well right now, but who exactly is in charge? A bunch of people who the future economy won't affect in the slightest. Since a large majority of millenials are bogged by debt, we can't afford to properly flourish the economy like we want to. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting to be more poor. Someone's going to get fucked. Technology is rapidly advancing, and many of the low-income jobs new grads have been forced to take are about to become obsolete. As there is no general income implemented yet, a LOT of people are about to be broke. The only really essential jobs will be things automation can't accomplish, e.g. unpredictable jobs. Almost any job in existence will likely eventually be run by a machine, I can't think of one that can't, there are factories in Japan that do maintenance on themselves. As an American, I don't know much about other nations, as school taught me exactly jack shit about them, but I have to wonder if they're in a similar boat. The model on which our economy is built rapidly becomes more out of date every minute. Eventually we WILL have to make changes, and I doubt those in power at the time will have the competence or open mindedness to do so. Of course, none of this mindset was helped by [this book] .

BigScience,cmv-136,"I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. I have been told that it costs an institution as little as one percent more for a loan applicant than if they took out cash. (This does not include fees.) To make matters worse, federal regulations require lenders to take into account the inability of students to pay back their debts when determining interest rates. This means higher rates and longer repayment periods. I think this is wrong on many levels but am curious about your viewpoint (if you know anything at all). In particular, what do we lose by locking down credit access? How would such measures affect our ability to get funding from private sources? Rather than tackle these complex issues head-on or with ideological solutions - like some people who claim that keeping money off the backs of lower-income Americans goes against American values - perhaps it's time to move away from thinking about how we can punish unwilling borrowers to start asking questions like:"

But the former presidential candidate and first lady of the United States has also been accused of making racially insensitive comments. One such comment was a 2008 speech in which Clinton said that the United States was ""not ready for a black president."" In a 2007 interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Clinton said that her husband, President Bill Clinton, ""had to walk on eggshells"" with the black community. ""If he'd said anything that I would have found offensive, I would have been up in arms,"" she said. ""And I don't think he did. He did a very good job."" But Clinton's record of racial comments is not limited to just her husband. In a 2004 speech at the National Press Club, Clinton said that ""for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a black woman in the White House would be very disturbing."" That statement caused outrage among many people, especially since Clinton's own family history is one of racial tension.

BigScience,cmv-137,"Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that ""for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight and sound of black skin is frightening."" In response to this statement, several commentators have stated that it represents racism; others maintain that simply putting a label on an experience does not make it any less real or unpleasant. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the darker side of college life: alcohol use, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior, suicide rates among students. The term ""student violence"" is widely used to describe these phenomena (cf., e.g., Lipscomb Johnson-Packard, 1982). However, while we are undoubtedly witnessing what may very well be more serious problems than those traditionally addressed by university administrators -for example, delinquency -we are also seeing some disturbing signs of change occurring at our institutions as they deal with all kinds of new challenges. For example: There appears to be greater concern within higher education about the prevalence of substance abuse among students, particularly young men. 1 College counselor training programs offer classes dealing primarily with group dynamics issues rather than with clients' personal difficulties. 2 A number of studies indicate that changes such as these might reflect increased awareness of related social ills but could conceivably be attributed other sources as well. Thus, as Cummings (1980) pointed out concerning media coverage of campus killings, [t]he stereotypical image of student drinking violence now serves only to increase public anxieties over violence and to divert attention from substance abuse concerns. (pp. 53-54) Although much work still needs to be done for research to come to terms with these phenomena (see, e.g., Roterman et al., 1984), perhaps one way researchers can do better would be if they looked beyond popular perceptions held by many critics when attempting to explain why so much crime occurs among college youths. Criminal Behavior Among Youth in General Basic criminological models assume that individuals commit crimes because their behavior violates societal norms regarding appropriate conduct. This assumption seems quite reasonable given that society's primary purpose is to protect its members against harm. Moreover, over evolutionary time human beings developed sets of cultural rules that anticipated behaviors that were thought likely to cause harm in short, ""social norms"" (e.g., see Herrnstein Murray, 1994). Yet despite these evident benefits, numerous scholars argue that most youth engage in antisocial acts. Indeed, research indicates that criminality increases during adolescence; thus, early adolescents tend to commit fewer offenses whereas late adolescent males tend to show higher levels of delinquent involvement across diverse countries including England, France, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Turkey (Hunter et al., 1979). Researchers seem divided on whether general trends toward escalation of misconduct occur throughout adolescence or instead represent different developmental patterns across age groups. Some suggest that children generally conform to societal expectations until juveniles receive substantial reinforcement for deviant behavior (Wagner Felson, 1970; see also Kagan Simmons, 1977) 3 Others emphasize differences between boys and girls suggesting that gender dysphoria plays an important role in children's motivation to transgress (Maffesoli, 1993; Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington Silva 1996) 4. By contrast, Wilson, Paulhus and Jacoby (1996) found no evidence that either sex deviated significantly from average behavior earlier in childhood before high school entry. What then accounts for the apparent rise in juvenile crime? Research suggests two main explanations. One possibility is based on biological explanations (with emphasis placed upon hormonal influences). According to this approach, psychological immaturities associated with puberty account for certain forms of violent behavior that become increasingly common during this period (Baumeister, 1971: Bauman, 1976 Dodge Pettit, 1987: Frick, 1991 Gaze, 1990 Gaze,, 1992 Huesmann, 1969; Pfefferbaum, 1981). Other authors have emphasized the importance of individual factors (e.g., sensation seeking, impulsivity), family background variables (e.g., parental psychopathology), community characteristics (e.g., neighborhood quality), peer pressure, and exposure to adult violence (Felitti et al., 1998; Sampson, Raudenbushand Earls, 1997: Sampsonand Laub, 1993). Although both approaches appear promising, they often leave us unable to understand how particular types of deviance develop into even more extreme manifestations. As Milgram and Farrall noted nearly 25 year ago (1975), ""For adults whose violence apparently erodes boundaries of propriety and justice, who seek immediate gratification and easy access to blood and guts... for them too little remains respectful"" (p. 12). Crime Prevention Programming: Linkages Between Extant Explanations? One reason that correlational data alone cannot reveal mechanisms underlying specific forms of deviance lies partly in the fact that prior experiences often serve as ""dynamic precursors"" to subsequent actions andor attitudes (Latane, Williams and Harkins 1968). Whereas past histories provide information relevant to current outcomes, they themselves rarely predict"

Personally I agree with her that a lot of people have negative stereotypes about black people and what they wear, and that we should all work to get past that. However, I was surprised by the amount of negative feedback she received. Mostly by people who said that she was ""racist"" for assuming that white people are more likely to fear black people, and other people who said that it was a stupid thing to say because ""hoodies don't mean anything"" and ""a hoodie is just a hoodie."" I'm sure that the people who think that are right. Hoodies are just hoodies, and they don't ""mean anything."" But I think that Hilary Clinton was just referring to the stereotypes that some people have. And I think she was right. I think that for some people, a black man in a hoodie is more likely to make them fearful than a white man in a hoodie. And I think that is because of the stereotypes and prejudices that people have about black people. I think that for a lot of people (but probably not for all) a black man in a hoodie makes them feel afraid because they assume that the black man is a criminal. And I think that a lot of white people assume that black men are criminals because of the prejudices they have about black people. And I think that a lot of white people have prejudices about black people because of all the negative stereotypes that they are exposed to by the media. A lot of movies have shown the bad guys wearing hoodies, and a lot of the bad guys in those movies have been black. I don't think that it is because the movie makers are racist and want to portray black people in a bad light. I think it is because they just want to show that a character is a criminal, and they need to think of a way to make the audience think that he is a criminal. And a hoodie is an easy way to do that. But I don't think that it is right. I think that because of the media and the way that it portrays black people, a lot of people in the world have prejudices against black people. And that is why Hilary Clinton said that a lot of people fear black people. And I think that is why a lot of people are angry with her. Because a lot of people don't want to admit that they have prejudices against black people, and they don't like the idea that Hilary Clinton is saying that they do. And I think that is why a lot of people are angry with Hilary Clinton for making her speech. Because a lot of people don't want to admit that they have prejudices against black people, and they don't like the idea that Hilary Clinton is saying that they do. I think that a lot of people are angry with Hilary Clinton for saying that they have prejudices against black people, because they want to think of themselves as being ""good people"" and ""not racist,"" and they don't want to admit that they have prejudices against black people.

Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context] of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context not doing their research. (Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many] [people] have discussed the ""sound-bit culture"" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites. Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people] who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary.... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it. To me, the fact that this ""quotable"" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquotedtaken out of context. We (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It's important to recognize that the term ""slut"" is often used in a derogatory and judgemental way towards women who are perceived to engage in sexual behaviors that are deemed socially unacceptable. These comments not only perpetuate harmful stereotypes and gender inequality, but also reinforce the idea that a person's worth is determined by their sexual activity. It's also worth noting that attraction is a personal preference and is highly subjective. However, it is important to refrain from shaming or belittling individuals based on their sexual behavior or preferences."

And if that is the case, it's likely a result of the fact that the term has been used to attack and belittle women, to shame them for being sexual. I guess it's the same as ""faggot"" and ""bitch"" and so on. Some people have taken to using the term ""pussy"" as a form of derogatory remark against men. It's been used to belittle men for being ""weak"" or ""emotional"" or ""less than"" and now it's being used to describe men who are rapists and sexual predators. I think the best way to deal with this is to not use any terms that belittle or degrade others, even if it's unintentional. Even if it's a word you use to describe yourself.

BigScience,cmv-138,"I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. On the internet it's almost like people feel entitled to their own opinion because of how much they are looking up and seeing. The best explanation I've seen to this comes from the famous girl's name - Scarlett O'Hara! She had been in love with Ashley Wilkes (who was married) until she meets Rhett Butler. But when he came by her house at night time after work, she turned him down! She says that she's waiting patiently all day while he's gone so he'll come again tomorrow... When he finally does get there she has no interest whatsoever. (Somewhat similar situation to LDS followers who have sex outside marriage). We live in such an era where people can easily say what other do. It should be left between you two whether your relationship is right or wrong. For me personally, I'm only interested in men whom I'd marry someday. Therefore, it doesn't bother my mind if someone else wants to sleep with them"
Human,cmv-138,"I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5 people is 100 defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive. Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected. Hello, users of CMV!

BigScience,cmv-139,"To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape. So Susan would be considered to have had a justified abortion (although her choice was not good). But even if she were obliged to abort her fetus due to some medical reason why the baby should live has no significance. What are your thoughts on this? EDIT: I think it's important to note what we consider to be ""just"" in moral terms. In general one can look at both utilitarianism and deontological ethics as ways for defining just actions: Utilitarianism: The kindest action will maximize happiness. Deontology: A right action must correspond with our obligations. However there may be significant philosophical disagreements about which of these two principles best describes how people judge their own behavior. For example it might be argued by those who adhere strictly to utilitarianism rather than deontological ethic that someone could rightly commit murder in order save another person from suffering serious physical injury while others say such things cannot happen. A: First off, nobody really knows. There isn't any scientific evidence to support either position. Secondly, you seem to imply that allowing women to choose whether or not to abort means they're responsible for deciding, but that's clearly not true - neither side wants them to take responsibility. You don't want me to kill myself because I feel guilty afterwards; neither do they so what's going on here?

To begin I will list some common arguments against abortion. The first is that the child in the womb is a human being, and to kill it is murder. The second is that the woman has a choice as to whether or not to have sex, and as a result if she gets pregnant she has to deal with the consequences. The third is that the child should be given a chance at life. The fourth is that the child is innocent and should not be punished for the mistakes of the parents. I will now give some common arguments for abortion. The first is that the child in the womb is not a human being, and as a result it is not murder. The second is that having the baby will put an undue strain on the woman's life and as a result she should have the choice whether or not to have the baby. The third is that the child may be born with a birth defect and as a result it is better to abort. The fourth is that it is the woman's body and she should be able to do with it as she pleases. Now I will give my own arguments against abortion. The first is that the child is a human being, and to kill it is murder. The second is that abortion is a cruel and painful death, even for the unborn. The third is that an abortion will hurt the mother physically, and emotionally. I will now give my own arguments for abortion. The first is that abortion is not murder. The second is that the child may be born with a birth defect and as a result it is better to abort. The third is that abortion is a simple and relatively painless procedure. I will now refute each of the arguments for abortion. The first argument is that abortion is not murder. This is not true. In order for something to be murder it must meet three criteria. The first is that it must be a human being. The second is that its life is intentionally taken. The third is that there is no moral justification for the killing. It is clear that all three criteria are met by abortion. The child in the womb is alive and clearly human. The child's life is intentionally taken during an abortion, because if it were not it would be born rather than aborted. Finally, there is no moral justification for the killing of an innocent child. Because the unborn child is a human being, and its life is intentionally taken without moral justification, abortion is murder. The second argument is that abortion is not cruel or painful. The following is a description of a partial birth abortion. ""The abortionist uses an ultrasound to locate the legs of the fetus in the uterus. He then pulls the legs into the birth canal. Next, he forces scissors into the base of the skull. Using the scissors, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the hole. After removing the scissors, he inserts a suction catheter into the hole and evacuates the skull contents. The skull collapses and the fetus is now dead. He removes the fetus."" It is clear that this procedure is painful. The third argument is that abortion is a simple and relatively painless procedure. While this is true, it does not change the fact that abortion is still murder. I will now refute each of the arguments against abortion. The first argument is that the child in the womb is a human being, and to kill it is murder. It is true that the child is a human being. However, it is not true that killing it is murder. Because the child is not viable outside the womb, and it is the property of the mother, it is not murder. The second argument is that having the baby will put an undue strain on the woman's life and as a result she should have the choice whether or not to have the baby. It is true that having a baby will put a strain on the woman's life. However, this is not an adequate reason to kill the baby. The third argument is that the child is innocent and should not be punished for the mistakes of the parents. It is true that the child is innocent, and should not be punished. However, killing the child is not punishment, it is a moral decision. Now I will give my own arguments against abortion. The first is that the child in the womb is a human being, and to kill it is murder. This is true, but irrelevant. Because the child is not"
Human,cmv-139,"To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape. I understand that this is a touchy topic so I'm sorry if what I'm saying comes off as offensive. That is not my intention. My main reasoning is basically this. Human life is incredibly valuable. It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights. As such the maximization of life should take precedence to other considerations, such as the right to choose whether or not you want to terminate a pregnancy. 80 or more of all pregnancies in the united states will be successful, and pursuing an abortion just decreases the amount of possible lives. To clarify my point here is a thought experiment. Say you have a 2 year old child and a woman who is pregnant. no one would argue that killing the 2 year old is wrong. No matter how humanely it happens, you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable. Also, the woman giving birth wouldn't have to take care of the child. contrary to popular belief, in recent years the number of children being put up for adoption has [steadily been decreasing,] while the time it takes for those who want to adopt a child has steadily been increasing, with some couples waiting up to seven years. As a note my stance here has nothing to do with any sort of spiritual beliefs. Also I'm left leaning on most issues so it has nothing to do with party alliances. please CMV! Hello, users of CMV!

Eleuther-AI,cmv-140,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) with the exception perhaps being Hinduism has only been around for roughly 13rd - half way through humanity's time on this planet and even then it was just one religion in many others that had already existed before Christianity gained major traction among its followers centuries ago into today where they are now numbering over 2 billion worldwide [1]. The other reasons why we should question religious beliefs: Many people who follow these mainstream ideologies believe their God (ess) religion mediates between them reality but do you think there would be such little scientific advancement if all humans were under some fictitious sky daddy entity? We can look at what happened when science began flourishing across Europe during renaissance times which coincided historically speaking about 800 years prior thus confirming our theory; however let us focus mainly onto how Europeans out gunned Muslims by 1500 AD after two hundred plus year initial contact period throughout history from start up until A D resulting due largely because Muslim leaders did nothing particularly groundbreaking except conquering territory while Christians diligently kept learning more every day! And yet those very same non believers still choose instead believing any random mythical story set down thousands upon millions earlier than theirs using ancient language no less despite having never traveled anywhere outside ones own borders nor ever knowing anyone else within said lands etc., indeed certain regions like Japan practicing Shinto worship although technically Buddhist really don't count since Buddhism didn't become massive enough elsewhere therefore diluting overall influence compared equally LDS members dramatically smaller numbers wise whose home country happens also happen..."
LLAMA,cmv-140,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) seems to be a means of justifying our behavior or seeking answers to the unknown. I have heard countless times over the years someone say, ""I am a good ChristianMuslimJew."" Good in the sense of I don't have a criminal record, I don't cheat on my wife, I don't steal, I don't drink alcohol, I don't cuss, etc. But what about your thoughts? Are they good? I'm not speaking of being 'good' or 'bad' in the sense of good and bad as far as sin or salvation goes. I'm talking about our thoughts as a means to justify our actions. It's common for us to think, ""Well, if I don't do it, someone else will,"" ""I'm not the only one doing it,"" ""I'm not hurting anyone,"" etc. We've all thought these things at one time or another. We've all used our thoughts to justify our actions, actions that we know deep down are not the best decisions for us. So what? It is also common for us to think that we can't possibly be wrong. We believe so strongly in something that it becomes hard to accept that we could be wrong. There have been countless wars that were started over people's inability to accept that they could be wrong. Many people have died because of this inability to accept that we could be wrong. The Muslims and Christians believe that their God is the only God and that everyone else is wrong. I'm not saying that one is right and the other is wrong. The Jews believe that they are the 'chosen' people, and that all of the land that is now Palestine belongs to them. The Palestinians believe that the Jews are invading and occupying their land. One is right and the other is wrong. Another thing that I have noticed is that organized religions seem to be based on fear. Most of the teachings are centered around the fear of going to hell or the fear of being left behind or the fear of being wrong. That is not to say that all religions are this way, but the popular ones are. My own personal belief is that the fear of death is so great, so powerful, that it can not be overcome. I believe that this is what makes us question ourselves and our beliefs, and that the fear of death and the fear of the unknown are the reasons that we are the way that we are. The way that we are is that we are weak. We are weak in that we cannot overcome the fear of death. We have to believe that there is something greater than us. We have to believe that something will be there when we die. Now, I am not a religious person. I don't believe that there is anything greater than us. I believe that we are an accident. I believe that the universe is an accident. I believe that we are the product of chemical reactions and that one day, we will cease to exist. I believe that the universe will end when the last star burns out and that it will start over again, with new stars, new planets, and new life. I believe that the universe is just a giant organism, that it is alive, and that it will continue to grow and change. I believe that there is nothing else after death. I believe that our consciousness is a product of the universe, and that we are not meant to understand it. I believe that we are too complex to understand the universe, that we are just a small part of it. I believe that there is no god, or gods, or goddesses. I believe that we are too complex to understand the universe and that one day, we will cease to exist. I'm not trying to push my beliefs on anyone, I'm merely trying to illustrate the importance of personal beliefs. I believe that the world would be a much better place if more people shared their personal beliefs. I believe that it is important to question your beliefs, to question why you believe what you believe. I believe that we need to be willing to accept that we could be wrong, even about our most deeply held beliefs. I believe that the world would be a much better place if people accepted that they could be wrong. I believe that the world would be a much better place if people shared their beliefs. I'm not sure if you're using this as a platform for your own personal beliefs, but if you are I think you might want to re-think your wording. In my opinion, using the word"
PaLM,cmv-140,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is based on the idea that there is a single, omnipotent God who created the universe and everything in it. This God is said to be all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good. However, there are many problems with this idea. First, there is no evidence to support the existence of such a God. There are no scientific laws or observations that point to the existence of a supernatural being. In fact, the more we learn about the universe, the less likely it seems that there is a God who created it all. Second, even if there were evidence to support the existence of God, it is not clear why we should worship him. If God is all-powerful, then he does not need our worship. If God is all-knowing, then he already knows what we are thinking and feeling. And if God is all-good, then he does not need us to do anything for him. Third, the idea of a single, omnipotent God is often used to justify violence and oppression. Throughout history, religious leaders have used the threat of eternal damnation to control people and to justify wars. Even today, religious extremism is a major source of violence and conflict in the world. The problems with the idea of a single, omnipotent God are so great that many people have abandoned religion altogether. These people do not believe in God, and they do not believe in any kind of supernatural being. They believe that the universe is a natural phenomenon, and that it does not require the existence of a God to explain it. Of course, there are also many people who continue to believe in God. These people find comfort and meaning in their faith. They believe that God is a loving and benevolent being who watches over them and protects them. They believe that God has a plan for their lives, and that they will be rewarded for their good deeds in the afterlife. Whether or not you believe in God is a personal decision. There is no right or wrong answer. However, it is important to be aware of the problems with the idea of a single, omnipotent God. It is also important to remember that religion is not the only way to find meaning and purpose in life."
Human,cmv-140,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways. The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as I know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that I would categorize as fairytale. This is what I would call a weakness. The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things,"" and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense. EDIT: Keep the comments coming guys - ""i'll secede on that point - ""moral guidance"" is not evidence for human weakness. But a motivation to believe in a creator."" Hello, users of CMV!

Tsinghua,cmv-140,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) has greatly reduced the amount of violence throughout the world. It has led to a more peaceful world. I don't believe that organized religions have caused or contributed to most of the violence throughout the world, but they have made the world more peaceful, because they have taken away the widespread belief that killing people is a good idea. As a result of the widespread belief in organized religions, the belief that violence is a good idea has been reduced. The existence of organized religions has had a great effect on the world, even if it was not their intention. Organized religion is still a force for good. There are very few people who are truly, and truly, a ""good"" person. However, most of the world's population does believe that they are. That is a fact, and a good thing. Most of the world's population believe they are good people, even though the vast majority of the world's population has committed heinous acts. If you are not a believer in organized religion, you have been living in a world that is largely composed of people who believe that they are good people, even though they have committed heinous acts. If you were to live in a world where most people did not believe they were good people, you would live in a much more dangerous world. I do not believe organized religion is a force for good, but I do believe that organized religion has made the world a more peaceful place. It is not because organized religion has reduced the amount of violence, but because it has made people less likely to believe that violence is a good idea. The existence of organized religion has had a great effect on the world, even if it was not their intention."

Human,cmv-141,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians. Example 1 (for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animalhuman relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they ""seem happy,"" or ""they don't run away"" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals. Example 2 (for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with ""consent."" So that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view! Edit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. Edit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not ""convince me that bestiality is wrong"" or ""convince me that bestiality hurts animals""; it is ""convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.""

Tsinghua,cmv-141,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have consent, but it requires a different sort of information and agreement. A couple of years ago, I worked at a startup. One of the founders was a PhD student in philosophy. He was pretty intelligent, and we had a few interesting conversations about his work. In one of these conversations, he explained that he believed that, for consent to be possible, the act must be both voluntary and informed. He explained that, in other words, the person engaging in the act must have an understanding of the nature of the act and of its consequences. This was not the usual consent definition, which focuses on the voluntariness of the act, but instead focused on the informed consent of the person engaging in the act. I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical about this definition, but it seemed like a plausible definition, and I thought I could probably find some other philosophers who would agree with it. I didn't really understand what he meant by ""informed consent"" until a couple of years later. I was having dinner with my girlfriend, and I was telling her about this philosophy conversation. She asked me what the conversation had been about. I explained the situation, and she said, ""So you think that consent requires both voluntariness and knowledge of the consequences?"" I thought about this, and said, ""Yeah, that sounds right."" She said, ""I'm sorry, but that's just not true. Voluntariness and knowledge of consequences are not necessary for consent. You can have consent without either of them."" I didn't know what to say. She was right. The act was not voluntary, and the person didn't know the consequences. She went on to say that, for consent to be possible, there needs to be some kind of shared understanding of the nature of the act. I said, ""Yeah, but that's just not true either."" She said, ""No, it is true. The only way consent is possible is if there is some kind of shared understanding of the nature of the act. Otherwise, the person engaging in the act doesn't understand what they are doing, and therefore, it is not consent."" I had to admit that she was right. There was no way for her to consent to the act, because she did not understand the nature of the act. She had no idea that it was something she could consent to. So, the definition of consent I had been using in my philosophy class wasn't even close to being true. She had not consented to the act. In fact, it was impossible for her to consent to the act. What this really means is that the definition of consent we have been using in philosophy class is not even close to being true. It is not even close to being a correct definition of consent. There is no way that consent can be a matter of consenting to an act without the person engaging in the act understanding the nature of the act. If there is no understanding of the nature of the act, then the act cannot be consent. I think that this is the right definition of consent. I think that, if there is no understanding of the nature of the act, then the act is not consent. I think that, if the act is not consent, then it is wrong. I think that, if it is wrong, then it is immoral. And I think that, if it is immoral, then we should not do it. Now, here's the thing: I know that the definition of consent I just described is not the one that we are usually taught in philosophy class. The definition we are usually taught is the one that focuses on the voluntariness of the act. But I think that, for consent to be possible, the act must be voluntary. I think that, for consent to be possible, there must be some kind of shared understanding of the nature of the act. If there is no shared understanding of the nature of the act, then the act cannot be consent. If the act is not consent, then it is not immoral. If it is not immoral, then it is not wrong. And if it is not wrong, then it is not immoral. And if it is not immoral, then we should not do it. So, the definition of consent we are usually taught in philosophy class is not even close to being a correct definition of consent. There is no way that consent can be a matter of consenting to an act without the person engaging in the act understanding the nature of the act. If there is no understanding of the nature of the act, then the act cannot be consent. If the act is not consent, then it is not immoral. If it is not immoral, then it is not wrong. And if it is not wrong, then we should not do it."
OpenAI,cmv-141,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to understand why this argument is used, since animals cannot communicate their consent in the same way humans can. However, consent is not the only factor when it comes to ethics and morality. The exploitation and mistreatment of animals, such as using them solely for human pleasure, is deemed unethical because of the suffering and harm it causes to the animals. It is also illegal in many countries. Animals are not able to understand or give their permission for sexual acts, and therefore engaging in them is a form of exploitation and abuse. Additionally, engaging in sexual acts with animals can contribute to the spreading of diseases and can have negative effects on the animal's health and well-being. Overall, even if an animal appears to participate willingly in sexual activity, it is still unethical to engage in such behavior because of the potential harm it can cause to the animal and the lack of ability for the animal to fully understand and consent to the act."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-141,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have a lot more than just sexual intercourse, and there might be other ways where we could obtain some sort or physical contact between human beings without necessarily having sex at all (and even if they had something else in mind). In this case ""consent"" doesn't really matter since imho animals don't give their informed opinions on affair like what you do with them etc., but simply reactions based solely by instinct - also known as consciousness; for example: fearing pain when killed losing reproductive ability after prolonged mating period due weakening body condition caused ehm... satisfied desire.... ermm.. psychology?;, so why not take advantage from animal's natural instincts instead giving up voluntarily being partakers!:-O"
LLAMA,cmv-141,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to get consent from a beast, but I think the problem is that such consent is unreliable. The reason is that animals do not have a long-term concept of the future and cannot consent to the long-term effects of their behavior. I think a human must be at least 10 years old to consent to sex because that is when they are capable of understanding the long-term consequences of their actions. I think it is possible for an animal to consent to sex with a human if the animal understands what sex is, but I think that such an animal is rare, and even if it does exist, its consent is unreliable. It is important to note that this argument against beastiality does not depend on the existence of an afterlife. "" Whoops! You're a Criminal - and that's bad for your wallet ""Look What They've Done To My Song, Ma"" "" Hmm, I'd suggest that Hmm, I'd suggest that non-human animals are incapable of consent at any age. They do not have the reasoning capacity to consent to sex with a human being, who clearly is capable of rational thought and the foresight to understand the consequences of sex. I don't think it is ever ethical to have sex with an animal, even if it seems to want to. I don't think that animals have the capacity to consent to sex with humans. They're not like us. They're animals. They do what their instincts tell them to do. That's it. (I was trying to make this thread different from the other beastiality threads...) I think you're conflating I think you're conflating two things in a way that doesn't make much sense. First, there is the issue of consent. You say that consent cannot be given by a human under 10 because they cannot understand the long-term consequences of their actions. I don't really see how age is relevant to this at all. If it is possible for a 10 year old to understand the consequences of their actions, it is possible for a 9 year old to do so. Second, there is the issue of consent itself. It seems to me that in most cases, humans cannot consent to sex. They consent to marriage, and the sex is a byproduct. In many cases, there is no consent at all. In fact, the issue of consent is really irrelevant for the purposes of marriage. The idea that one must be 10 years old to consent to sex makes no sense to me. I don't really see how age is a factor in understanding long-term consequences, so I don't see why age is relevant to consent. I suppose the reason why we want 10 year olds to be able to consent to sex is to prevent pedophiles from having sex with 9 year olds. But if a 9 year old understands the long-term consequences of their actions, and they consent to sex with an adult, I don't see why we should stop them. I mean, if they understand the consequences, why should we prevent them? The only reason why I can think of is that we don't want to allow them to consent to sex because they are too young, and they might be persuaded to have sex even if they don't want to. In that case, I think the problem is one of persuasion, not consent. It seems to me that the question of whether or not humans can consent to sex with animals is a different question than whether or not humans can consent to sex with humans. For a human to consent to sex with a human, they must be able to understand the long-term consequences of their actions, but this is not true for animals. Animals do not have the capacity for understanding the long-term consequences of their actions, but they do have the capacity for understanding what sex is. Now, the question is, can an animal consent to sex with a human? I would say yes, if they understand what sex is. I think this understanding of sex is more important than the ability to understand the long-term consequences. It's more important to understand the nature of sex than to understand the long-term consequences of sex. The reason is that sex is a physical act, and the long-term consequences are mental. If you want to have sex, you need to know what it is, but you don't need to know the long-term consequences of it. Also, I'm not really sure why it is that animals are incapable of consent. If an animal is"
BigScience,cmv-141,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to find a respected and authoritative source that says, ""Consent can be inferred from some action or inaction."" I say this as someone who has been involved with animal right groups for almost twenty years. A good example here would be when people try to argue over whether or not we should allow dogs on public transport - arguing only based on statements like ""I am allergic to dog hair so therefore don't let me ride on your bus....etc"" These kinds of arguments have no basis at all; they do not even make sense logically (as if there wasn't already enough confusion around sexual relations between humans). People make these judgemental comments without ever thinking about how bad it really must feel for those being harmed by them. Animals may disagree with you, but their feelings aren't taken into account either. The big issue here though, seems to ben't why animals can't give informed consent, it's more likely because sex turns certain humans off."

People assume that because I am a parent, I must know a lot about education. This is also not always true. Just because I am a parent doesn’t mean that I know everything about education. I am still learning about education every day. Third, I am a blogger. I write about education on my blog. People assume that because I write about education, I must know a lot about education. This is also not always true. Just because I write about education doesn’t mean that I know everything about education. I am still learning about education every day. So why do people look to me for information about education? I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I’m a teacher. Maybe it’s because I’m a parent. Maybe it’s because I’m a blogger. Whatever the reason, I think it’s important to remember that I am not an expert on education. I am just a person who is learning about education every day."
OpenAI,cmv-142,"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, would you ask me for help instead of seeking out someone who has direct experience with what you're interested in? There could be several reasons why someone would choose to ask for help from an AI assistant rather than seeking out a human with direct experience: 1. Accessibility - An AI assistant is available 247 and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be especially helpful if you need assistance outside of regular business hours or if you're in a location where it's not possible to find someone with direct experience. 2. Speed - AI assistants can process information much faster than humans can. This means that you can get answers to your questions more quickly than if you were to search for answers on your own or ask a human for help. 3. Unbiased information - Sometimes when you ask someone who has direct experience, they may have their own biases or preferences that come into play when they answer your questions. An AI assistant can provide unbiased information based on data and algorithms, rather than personal experience or opinions. 4. Privacy - Depending on the nature of your question, you may not want to share personal or sensitive information with someone who has direct experience. Asking an AI assistant can be a more private and secure way to get the information you need. Overall, there are many benefits to asking for help from an AI assistant, and it can be a helpful tool for learning more about an idea, product, or topic."
Tsinghua,cmv-142,"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, am I so averse to taking the opposite approach? I can't tell you why I'm afraid of the opposite approach, but it seems to me that I should not be. I want to be sure that I have no assumptions about what the ""other"" person might say, what he might think. It is easy to see that this fear might arise from something that I've experienced before, but I can't tell you what that experience is. Is it fear of failure? Fear of disapproval? I'm afraid of the ""other"" person not liking what I'm saying or what I'm doing. The main thing is that I have the feeling that if I say or do something, I will be criticized. Somehow, I have this feeling that I will be blamed if I'm not perfect. If I make a mistake, I will be accused of being incompetent. The truth is, of course, that I will be blamed if I make a mistake, but it is not clear to me why I should fear this. I think it is because I don't want to be blamed for something I didn't do. Somehow, it is the feeling of responsibility for the other person that bothers me. I am afraid of the other person, not of myself. I am afraid that if I'm not perfect, he will be disappointed in me. He will feel betrayed, and I will be blamed. It seems to me that I should be willing to take responsibility for what I do and what I say. If I make a mistake, I should be willing to admit it. I should be willing to accept the blame, not blame the other person. I should not blame the other person for what I've done. I should not blame him for my mistakes. This, I think, is a mistake. I am afraid that I might make a mistake, and that the other person will be disappointed in me. It seems to me that I should be willing to take responsibility for what I do and what I say. If I make a mistake, I should be willing to admit it. I should be willing to accept the blame, not blame the other person. I should not blame the other person for what I've done. I should not blame him for my mistakes. This, I think, is a mistake. In that case, why do I have this fear? The reason I think that I should be willing to take responsibility for what I do and what I say is that it seems to me that this is the way things are supposed to be. This is the way life is supposed to be. I think that this is the way life should be, but I don't know why. I'm afraid that I might make a mistake, and that the other person will be disappointed in me. It seems to me that I should be willing to take responsibility for what I do and what I say. If I make a mistake, I should be willing to admit it. I should be willing to accept the blame, not blame the other person. I should not blame the other person for what I've done. I should not blame him for my mistakes. This, I think, is a mistake. I am afraid that I might make a mistake, and that the other person will be disappointed in me. It seems to me that I should be willing to take responsibility for what I do and what I say. If I make a mistake, I should be willing to admit it. I should be willing to accept the blame, not blame the other person. I should not blame the other person for what I've done. I should not blame him for my mistakes. This, I think, is a mistake. Now I know why I have this fear. The other person will be disappointed in me, and he will be angry. This is why I have the fear. The problem is that I don't know what the ""other"" person might think or feel. I don't know what he will be disappointed in me for, or what he will feel. I can't know that. All I can do is to try to be sincere, and I think that this is all that I can do. If I am sincere, then I will know that I have done the best that I can. If I am sincere, I will know that I have done the best that I can, and I will not be disappointed in myself. If I am sincere, I will know that I have done the best that I can, and I will not be disappointed in myself. What about Being ""Perfect""? What about being ""perfect""? It seems to me that there are two kinds of perfectionism. One kind of perfectionism is about being perfect."

LLAMA,cmv-142,"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do we think that a salesperson is the best source for information about an idea, product, etc.? I know that salespeople are trained to answer questions about their products and services, but if you want to know more about the benefits, features, and value of a product or service, why not talk to someone who is actually using it? Salespeople have only a limited amount of time to spend with each prospect. If you want to learn about the history of a product or service, learn from people who have been using it for years. If you want to learn about the current benefits, features, and value of a product or service, learn from people who are using it now. This is the premise behind a lot of business social networking. Someone who is interested in a product or service asks their social network who uses that product or service and they get a list of people they can talk to. I think that the next step in this process is to have people with these interests set up their social networks so that people can find them. This is why I created my Twitter account with my contact information and a list of the products and services I use. If someone is looking for a user of a product or service that I use, I want them to be able to find me easily. In the future, I think that we will see more products and services that allow you to find someone who uses the product or service you are interested in. If you are interested in a product or service, I encourage you to find someone who uses it and ask them about their experience. If you are a user of a product or service, I encourage you to set up your social networks so that people can find you."
Human,cmv-143,"First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces redditors to deal with consequences if they are downvoted. This creates a system, where, if you disagree with someone, you can downvote them. This also means that going against the hivemind will net you downvotes, resulting in people who spout popular opinions being the only ones who can do anything. Ex: rmovies does a thread about LOTR. You say you didn't enjoy it. You get downvotes and aren't allowed to speak in rmovies until you wait ten minutes."
OpenAI,cmv-143,"First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces users to see only the most upvoted comments first. This means that popular opinions get more visibility, while unpopular opinions get drowned out, leading to a bias towards the beliefs of the majority. As a first time CMVer, it's important to consider how this system can impact communication and decision making. It's important to recognize that the most popular opinion may not always be the best one or the most accurate. As a community manager, you can work to facilitate open and respectful communication where all opinions are heard and considered. This can be achieved by encouraging diverse perspectives, promoting active listening, and discouraging personal attacks or dismissive behavior towards differing opinions. Additionally, it may be helpful to create a system that promotes the sharing and highlighting of different viewpoints, such as feature threads or discussion groups focused on specific topics."

It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces consensus by allowing people to hide their own thoughts and neutrality only works when there is an overall upvote percentage that doesn't deviate too far from the whole. On sites where the community around each post can be checked (e.g., Wikipedia), it seems that comments aren't actually needed at all - they just complicate things I don't think it's necessary for every article on Wikipedia, however; many articles have discussion lists or chat rooms which often get responses quick enough to prevent them being needlessly slowed down with comments. I agree that comments do create the kind of social pressure we hate so much: witness my experience as a moderator trying to sort through spamoff-topic posts on our forums here. Remembering some other examples like That Old Codger? I'm not sure I want any more cross-posts between sites. (Cross-posting should happen rarely if ever.) We also avoid requiring users to log-in, because the problems you mention above would escalate without us needing to deal with ID verification issues, etc. (Warning: This isn't intended to address your question about closing questions I guess.) I've seen questions closed as off topic even though they're clearly on topic. Closers seem to ignore what constitutes language usage standards, which means that sometimes bad grammar or spelling goes unnoticed. The best way to fix these kinds of errors, instead of going back and hitting edit, is simply flagging and asking someone who knows how English syntax works to reword the sentence according to correct rules."
LLAMA,cmv-143,"First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces comments in a certain direction. Downvotes are accepted by making all downvoted comments hidden by default. This is done in two ways: a) The ""showdead"" option is disabled by default. b) The downvoted comments are hidden by default. In other words, the reddit system allows comments to be hidden without the user opting in to this. That's a huge design error. Furthermore, reddit's comment sorting system is broken. Comments are sorted by a combination of downvotes and upvotes, but this gives the user the ability to choose how comments are sorted. Why is this a problem? Because the majority of people who use reddit would rather see the popular opinion than the controversial one. A good comment system should not have this problem. It should let the user make the choice of what he or she wants to see, but it should not force the user in a certain direction. In this way, Reddit's comment system is broken."

Also, this system creates a lot of power in the hands of a few, because they are able to shape the discussion.

LLAMA,cmv-144,"From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground. His work ethic and ability to think outside the box made him one of the best presidents to ever hold office. Kennedy was able to do so much good in his brief term that he was able to overcome the fact he was a womanizer and had mafia connections. He was able to avoid war with the Russians by holding his own in the Cuban missile crisis. He created the Peace Corp and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nobody has ever been more prepared for the job than Washington. He had the trust of the people and knew what needed to be done. He was also the perfect person to unify the country after the Revolutionary War. He was a great orator and one of the most brilliant presidents ever. He was able to prevent a civil war from happening over the issue of slavery. He was able to avoid war with Great Britain over the Oregon Territory. He also avoided war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas. He brought us out of the Great Depression and World War II. His policies led to the longest period of prosperity in history. He was also a brilliant orator, though not as good as Lincoln. He was the first president to stand up to the Supreme Court, the first president to order the army to put down a rebellion, the first president to build a national highway, the first president to use federal troops to enforce civil rights. He was the first president to take on big business, the first president to travel abroad while in office, and he set the precedent for direct election of senators by the people. He was also the first president to be impeached and the first to be unfaithful in office. His honesty, integrity and leadership ability were all superb. He was able to keep the country together during the Civil War and abolish slavery. His assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have fueled the fascination with him for over a century. His was the best president of the 20th century. He reformed the banking system and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to prevent bank failures.

He was the most intelligent president and was able to use his high level of education to guide him through the American Revolution, the Constitutional Convention and his presidency. His policies, good and bad, have left the country with an enormous national debt and a massive bureaucracy. His New Deal policies helped get us out of the Great Depression but many of his policies have failed to work as he intended. He was a great leader but his personal life was in shambles. He abused his power as president in the Watergate scandal and his foreign policy was a disaster. The Articles of Confederation proved to be a complete failure. The only thing they got right was the name of the country. They were unable to get the individual states to agree on a national currency, and their inability to raise taxes prevented them from being able to do anything. His policies helped prolong the Great Depression and prolong World War II. His foreign policy was a disaster. His inability to keep the country together led to the Civil War and his policies had a devastating effect on the freed slaves. He was also a poor manager of the country's finances. He was a lousy manager of the country's finances and couldn't even keep his own finances straight. He was the first president to leave office with a national debt higher than when he took office. He was a terrible manager of the country's finances and couldn't even keep his own finances straight. He was the first president to leave office with a national debt higher than when he took office.

BigScience,cmv-145,"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and equipment from the state, but it's just hard for me to imagine how much more effective this would be with in-house staff. Fortunately we don't have any local wildfires here so I'm not sure if that's relevant or not. But anyway... seems like something you should keep an eye on! How about having a professional firefighting team which is paid by the city? That way they're trained (and possibly even invested) into fighting fires rather than being hired out to companies who will only pay them when someone gets injured or killed. I'm currently doing some research into a similar structure; right now we're looking at hiring private contractors for many different services, but there's definitely a desire within the city council to get rid of the need for those businesses altogether after seeing what happened during Katrina. (There's also plans to build a new jail, which may end up happening before the renovations are finished!) I think there needs to be some sort of oversight over these contracts as well because recently we've seen stories of people falsifying their credentials to gain access to civilian jobs (typically construction jobs), then stealing money from the employer once they've been caught. In addition to trying to improve upon our current resources you're probably going to face opposition to your request since the Fire Department isn't necessarily one of the most popular departments around town - especially among older residents. The fact that you've added another 12 full-time employees doesn't help either!"

I know that they do receive training Yes, volunteer firefighters receive extensive training and are qualified to respond to emergency situations. While it may seem strange to rely on volunteers for such an important task, many small towns and rural areas simply cannot afford to hire a full-time professional fire department. Volunteer firefighters often have other full-time jobs while also serving their community, and their dedication and sacrifice should be commended. Additionally, many professional firefighters began their careers as volunteer firefighters and gained valuable experience and training that allowed them to transition to full-time positions."
PaLM,cmv-145,"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training, but it's not like they're professional firefighters. They have day jobs and families to take care of, and I can't imagine that they're always on top of their game. I mean, what if there's a big fire? What if there are multiple fires? What if the volunteers are all busy with other things and can't get to the fire in time? It just seems like a recipe for disaster. I know that some people will say that volunteers are the only way that small towns can afford to have a fire department. But I think that's a cop-out. There are other ways to fund a fire department, such as raising taxes or getting grants from the government. I'm not saying that volunteers are bad. They're doing a great job with the resources that they have. But I think that it's time for my hometown to invest in a professional fire department. It would be a lot safer for everyone involved. Here are some of the reasons why I think that my hometown should have a professional fire department:  Professional firefighters are better trained. They have more experience and they know how to handle all kinds of emergencies. They're also more likely to be up-to-date on the latest firefighting techniques.  Professional firefighters are more available. They're on call 24/7, so they can respond to fires at any time of day or night. Volunteers, on the other hand, have day jobs and families to take care of, so they may not always be available when a fire breaks out.  Professional firefighters have better equipment. They have access to the latest firefighting equipment, which can help them to put out fires more quickly and efficiently. Volunteers, on the other hand, may have to use outdated or inferior equipment. I believe that investing in a professional fire department would be a wise decision for my hometown. It would make our community safer and it would give us peace of mind knowing that we have the best possible protection against fires. Here are some of the specific benefits that a professional fire department would bring to my hometown:  Reduced risk of fire damage. Professional firefighters are more likely to be able to put out fires before they cause significant damage. This would save homeowners and businesses money and it would also help to prevent injuries and loss of life.  Reduced response times. Professional firefighters are on call 24/7, so they can respond to fires more quickly than volunteers. This could mean the difference between saving a home or business and letting it burn to the ground.  Increased public safety. Professional firefighters are trained to handle all kinds of emergencies, not just fires. This means that they would be able to provide assistance with other incidents, such as car accidents, natural disasters, and medical emergencies. I believe that the benefits of having a professional fire department far outweigh the costs. It would make our community safer and it would give us peace of mind knowing that we have the best possible protection against fires. I urge my local government to consider investing in a professional fire department."

In the two years that I've lived here, I have been shocked by the number of sirens that go off on any given day. I know that they can mean anything. I've seen them for accidents on the highway, and I've seen them for real fires, but I'm always struck by how many of them there are. I don't know. It's just odd."
Human,cmv-145,"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training but knowing some of them personally they really take it all as some joke- not saying that all volunteers do -but I think that if your going to be in charge of saving someones life and are going to risk your own life you should be a paid professional. Other than the argument that paying firefighters is too expensive for the state why the heck else do all these small towns rely on locals to just figure it out themselves. Edit: Please see thndrchld and Mine's conversation below And as far a what I said by taking it as a joke I know a kid that joined because he wanted to shack-up in a fire engine, An ex of mine's grandfather was the long running lead volunteer fighter and often joke that if a N's house caught fire he'd let them burn- these are the things that went on in my small home town. And that is one of the main reason that I feel this should be handled by professionals, not just and guy off the street with his own agenda.- so one more question- if you were volunteering with either of the guys I mentioned what would you do? and how could you have those people removed? celeritas365 made a good point What about mixed? In my town we have some professionals and some volunteers. Some of the volunteers are more for support and can't go into a burning building. The stuff that happens outside is still important. Why pay a full firefighter when you don't need all of his or her skills? Also, much of what fire departments do is checking for fires when a house alarm goes off and doing small yet important things like chemically treating gasoline spills from auto accidents so they don't catch fire. While important, I don't see why a team of ALL professional firefighters need to do these tasks. I think maybe thats what I mean more- There should be professionals at all depts, no ALL volunteer depts should exist.- that also solves the money issue with for example 1 pro for every 5 volunteers. Ada1629 Also had a good point on my thoughts However, I feel uncomfortable with people working for free - it becomes suspect to me that something more nefarious is going on I also question how stringent the rules are when there is nothing on the line but free labor for those doing the ""hiring""?

Tsinghua,cmv-145,"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and I know that they do receive safety equipment, but it's still pretty ridiculous that they're the only ones that can go out and put out fires. But this past summer, I decided to make that my goal. I knew I wanted to go to the big fires. I knew I wanted to see the smoke and the destruction. I wanted to experience what it's like to be a part of something that big. And so I decided to go to California and volunteer with the Rural Volunteer Fire Department, the fire department that fights fires in the western part of California. I wanted to be able to experience firsthand what it's like to be part of something like that. It's an incredible experience. You get to see things you can't see anywhere else. You get to see the most beautiful, wild places. And you get to see the most heartbreaking, beautiful places. So I've learned a lot about firefighting and I've learned a lot about how our natural world works. I've learned about our natural resources and how important it is to conserve and how important it is to protect them. And it's made me more aware of the importance of our natural world and how we need to protect it. And that's a very important thing to me. And so I'm not sure what I'm going to do after I graduate. I think I'm going to go to law school. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do yet. But I think that I'm going to want to go back to California and work with some sort of environmental organization. I think I'm going to want to work with some sort of environmental organization. I want to do something that's going to help protect the natural world and the natural resources that we have. And I want to do something that's going to help protect the natural world and the natural resources that we have."
LLAMA,cmv-146,"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of making us moral. The government is in the business of keeping people happy so they get elected, and we can see very clearly that the majority of Americans are opposed to being forced to be moral. Hence, I am against the government being involved in charity. I also believe that the government is generally incapable of giving charity without corruption or waste, and without turning it into a patronage system. Where I am conflicted is on the tax code, and the question of whether government should favor charity at all. On one hand, I believe that charity is generally a good thing, and it may be in the government's interest to encourage it. On the other hand, I believe that the government should not be in the business of making people more moral, and that's what tax exemptions for charitable giving do. The tax code is a way to make moral choices. I am in favor of a very simple tax code, and I don't think the government should be in the business of making people's choices for them. But I also think that a tax code that says ""there will be no tax exemptions for anything"" is a bit draconian. I'm not sure how much I care about the tax code favoring charity over spending. I think that charity is generally a good thing, and I think that the government should be neutral on the question of whether people give to charity or spend the money. But I also think the government should be neutral on the question of whether people choose to have children or not, and I support a child tax credit. So clearly I am not as opposed to moral nudges as I think I am. I think the question is more whether the tax code should favor saving or spending. I believe that saving is a good thing, and spending is a bad thing. And I believe that the tax code should reflect this. I think the tax code should be very simple, and it should have very few exemptions, but I think there should be a few exemptions for spending on ""good things."" In addition to charity, I would include health care spending, and education spending. The tax code should not favor spending on cars, TVs, or even food. I think this is a good policy, and good politics. It's also good morality. A simple tax code is an easy sell. Even Republicans support it, though their desire to eliminate capital gains taxes makes them inconsistent. But a simple tax code that also favors charity, education, and health care is a good way to sell it to the general public."
OpenAI,cmv-146,"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of forcing individuals to donate money. While it is commendable for people to voluntarily donate their excess money to charitable causes, it is ultimately up to each individual to decide how they want to use their resources. However, governments do have a responsibility to promote charitable giving and provide tax incentives to encourage individuals and corporations to donate to non-profit organizations. This can be a way to ensure that resources are distributed more equitably and to support organizations that work towards social good. As an assistant, I am happy to help provide information about charities and non-profit organizations that align with your values and interests if you are interested in making a donation."

BigScience,cmv-146,"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of asking you for your hard earned money unless it has an official mandate from Congress, or perhaps even new legislation. The fact remains however, there are some things which would be better off leaving up to charity. An example would be student loans and housing debt. The problem with these debts? They're unpaid at death - hence why we allow them through inheritance taxes so as to avoid foreclosure on the homeowners estate when they pass away. There's nothing wrong with giving back what was borrowed but I think it's important to keep mortgage interest payments out of grandchildren's inheritances just like other family expenses shouldn't be counted toward their inheritance tax exemption. It's the same way for education loan interest payments too! That doesn't mean that every one who inherits either loses hisher house or cannot graduate with college savings accounts left behind, just keeping it simple! Interest rates will rise eventually whether you want them to or not. (Yet another reason why owning property in general is considered good investmnent). When combined together, all these factors can lead to staggering amounts that add up quickly if you're prepared to take advantage of this time period to make those improvements and purchase something more comfortable depending on how long you intend to live here anyway..."
PaLM,cmv-146,"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of charity. It is the government’s job to uphold the laws and protect the rights of its citizens. It is not the government’s job to redistribute wealth or to provide for those who are less fortunate. There are many private charities that exist to help those in need. These charities are able to provide assistance in a more efficient and effective manner than the government could. The government is too big and bureaucratic to be able to effectively administer social programs. As a result, government-run programs often end up being inefficient and wasteful. In addition, government-run programs often create a culture of dependency. When people rely on the government for their basic needs, they become less likely to take responsibility for their own lives. This can lead to a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break. I believe that the best way to help those in need is to support private charities. These charities are able to provide assistance in a more efficient and effective manner than the government could. They are also more likely to create a culture of independence and self-reliance. Of course, there are some people who will argue that the government has a moral obligation to help those in need. They will say that it is the government’s job to ensure that everyone has a basic standard of living. However, I disagree. I believe that the government’s role is to protect the rights of its citizens, not to provide for their needs. The government should not be in the business of charity.

Human,cmv-146,"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of moralizing. The government is established to protect inalienable rights and to allow for fair competition. There are many cases where the government is not doing its job in allowing for fair competition, but I am not speaking about these cases. I'm going to give a few scenarios, and I'd love if someone who disagrees could criticize the conclusions I make. - There are two pizza delivery companies. One of the company owners, Pablo, spent every night for the past 6 months figuring out how to optimize his business. He found better ways to incubate pizzas, better ways to stack pizzas in his pizza-mobile, and also found better ways to pizza his pizza. Because of this, more people are buying his pizzas. In the next year, Pablo earned three times as much as his competitor. Pablo sends his kids to public school, and has the same amount of kids as his competitor; he goes to the doctor when he is ill, and goes the same amount of times as his competitor; he's an American just like his competitor, and benefits from military defense in the same way; why on Earth would Pablo have to spend multiple times as much money on these things than his competitor? I really don't get it, I'm sorry. They utilize the same services in the same exact way, why is Pablo in essence subsidizing his competitor's payments just because Pablo is a smarter, more efficient businessman? - There's a marathon going on in Vermont. Two hundred participants compete for the 1,000 given to first, second, and third place. Each participant puts down 20, which goes toward prize money and ensuring the event is run well. Each winner splits the prize money. At the end of the race, the three winners of first, second, and third place are shocked to find out that they are only taking home 120. The event organizers apparently decided that the winners, despite working harder and simply being better at their craft, and despite equally paying for the organization of the event, should have to pay the other participants for simply existing. I just don't get it. If I drive to work and pass a bridge, I need to pay the toll because bridges cost money. Great. And perhaps I should pay in proportion to how much I drive, that seems like a good idea as well. But if I make a successful website that utilizes none of the services, and in fact very few services at all, is it not plainly theft that a bureaucrat decides where my EARNED money goes? I'd rather donate the money I don't need to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to environmental causes, to the cure for cancer, but the government seems to be stealing it from me so they can play live-action Battlefield 5: Real Life Edition. Someone please explain what I am missing. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Tsinghua,cmv-146,"I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of charity. If you want to give money to charity, that's your choice. But don't expect the government to do it for you. You don't need to make a point of it, but you should realize that in many cases, you're giving money to the government for nothing in return. 2. You Should Support Government Regulation Over Lobbyists Honestly, the last time I paid attention to lobbying, I thought it was a good thing. After all, the purpose of lobbying is to get your message to your elected officials, and you should want them to hear you. Lobbyists are paid to put your message in front of your elected officials. However, as I mentioned in the previous point, government doesn't do things for people. It does things for money. If you think that lobbying is a good thing, then you think that government regulation is a good thing. So let's talk about that. I think the proper role of government is to make sure that corporations are not abusing the people. That's it. Government shouldn't be a huge corporate welfare program. Government shouldn't be a huge handout program. Government shouldn't be a huge government expansion program. Government should be a huge government shrink program. If you think that regulation is a good thing, then you think that the people are being abused by corporations. So you think that government regulation is a good thing. And you're basically saying that the people should have no say in what happens to corporations. And if you think that's a good thing, then you're basically saying that you're okay with corporations and government working hand in hand to keep the people in line. But if you think that regulation is a bad thing, then you think that corporations are good. And if you think that corporations are good, then you think that government regulation is bad. And if you think that government regulation is bad, then you think that the people are being abused by corporations. And if you think that the people are being abused by corporations, then you're basically saying that you're okay with corporations and government working hand in hand to keep the people in line. 3. You Should Not Support a Government that Can Dictate What You Can and Cannot Do (Except in the Case of Weapons and Drugs) I understand that this point might seem a little confusing, so let me explain it a little more. The government is the people. The people have a right to determine what the government can and cannot do. For example, the people have a right to determine that the government cannot tell them what they can and cannot buy, where they can and cannot go, or what they can and cannot say. But if you support a government that can tell you what you can and cannot do, then you are basically saying that you're okay with the people and the government working hand in hand to keep the people in line. That's not a good thing. 4. You Should Not Support a Government That Is Powerful Enough to Take Away Your Rights I'm not sure what kind of point this is supposed to be. It doesn't really make sense. 5. You Should Not Support a Government That Has Corruption (Unless It's a Foreign Government) I think this is a valid point, but I don't think it's very well articulated. You can have a corrupt government without having a corrupt Congress. You can have a corrupt Congress without having a corrupt President. And you can have a corrupt President without having a corrupt Cabinet. I think this is a valid point, but I don't think it's very well articulated. You can have a corrupt government without having a corrupt Congress. You can have a corrupt Congress without having a corrupt President. And you can have a corrupt President without having a corrupt Cabinet. 6. You Should Not Support a Government That Has Failed in Its Fundamental Responsibilities (Unless It's a Foreign Government) I think this is a valid point, but I don't think it's very well articulated. You can have a corrupt government without having a corrupt Congress. You can have a corrupt Congress without having a corrupt President. And you can have a corrupt President without having a corrupt Cabinet. I think this is a valid point, but I don't think it's very well articulated. You can have a corrupt government without having a corrupt Congress. You can have a corrupt Congress without having a corrupt President. And you can have a corrupt President without having a corrupt Cabinet. 7. You Should Not Support a Government That Uses Its Power to Persecute People (Unless It's a Foreign Government) I think this is a valid point, but I don't think it's very well articulated."
Human,cmv-147,"Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Given that killing animals for food is not generally immoral1, there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other; neither is the life of a cow so rich and fulfilling2 that it's immoral to deprive a baby cow of it before it dies. Therefore, I should not feel any worse eating veal than I do eating a hamburger. 1 If you disagree with this, that's a different argument entirely; I'm glad to hear your opinion on the matter, but you won't change my view unless your argument assumes this point. 2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I do think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering). Again, this isn't the topic of my CMV, but if you want to give your opinion on the matter I'd be glad to hear it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Tsinghua,cmv-147,"Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. But we need the milk and meat and dairy products that cows produce, and we don't need the animal's life. Surely, if you had a choice, you would choose to live with all the animals, and not just the ones that you really enjoy, and not just the ones that you like to think you're helping, and not just the ones that are not a threat to you. You might be asking yourself, ""Who am I to ask you to live with the animals you do not enjoy? Who am I to make demands on you? What right do I have to tell you how to live?"" But if you ask yourself these questions, you will be able to answer them. You are a person, and you have the right to make your own choices about how to live your life. I don't know if you will choose to live with the animals you don't enjoy, but if you do, you are entitled to the same consideration as those of us who do. I have made a decision to live with the animals I enjoy. You have made a decision to live with the animals you enjoy. We have both made decisions that have consequences for each of us. So let's look at the consequences of each of our decisions. If you live with the animals you enjoy, you have no need for all the animals, and all the animals you do not enjoy, to be on the earth. You will be able to do the things that you enjoy. You will be able to live your life with the animals you enjoy, and you will be able to live your life without the animals you do not enjoy. But the animals you do not enjoy will still be here, and the consequences of their continued existence are just as serious as the consequences of your continued existence. If you live with the animals you enjoy, the animals you do not enjoy will have no rights, no way to express their preferences, and no way to express their humanity. They will have no voice, no say in what happens to them, and no way to avoid being abused. They will be a threat to your well-being, and they will be used as a resource to sustain your well-being. You will be able to continue to do the things that you enjoy, and the animals you do not enjoy will be treated as resources. But the animals you do not enjoy will still be here, and the consequences of their continued existence are just as serious as the consequences of your continued existence. You may say that your decision to live with the animals you enjoy will not be for all of the animals, and that there will be enough for all the animals. But your decision to live with the animals you enjoy is not a decision for all the animals. You are deciding for the animals that you like, and for the animals that you don't like, but you are not making a decision for all the animals. The decisions that you make, and the decisions that you don't make, have consequences for all the animals. Your decision to live with the animals you enjoy is a decision that has consequences for all the animals. You will be able to do the things that you enjoy, and the animals you do not enjoy will be treated as resources. But the animals you do not enjoy will still be here, and the consequences of their continued existence are just as serious as the consequences of your continued existence. You may say that you will take care of the animals you don't like, and that they will have a good life. But if you don't like the animals you don't like, why would you want to take care of them? If you are going to do the things that you enjoy, you are not going to want to take care of the animals you don't like. If you are going to live your life without the animals you don't like, you are not going to want to take care of the animals you don't like. If you are going to live your life with the animals you enjoy, you are going to want to take care of the animals you enjoy. You are going to want to be a part of the animal world, and you are going to want to be part of the animal community. And if you are going to live your life with the animals you enjoy, you are going to want to help the animals that you enjoy. But if you don't like the animals you don't like, why would you want to help them? If you don't like the animals you don't like, why would you want to take care of them?

LLAMA,cmv-147,"Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. They don't know that one day they'll be murdered for their meat, nor do they care. They're just cows. If you really believe that a cow is an intelligent being that should be allowed to live out its days grazing on a field, then you should also believe that a cow should be allowed to live out its days munching on a field of carrots. That's how you'd live your life if you were a cow. If you really believe that cows should be allowed to live out their days in a field, then why aren't you doing that? If you genuinely believe that cows should be allowed to live out their lives in a field, then why are you living in a house? Why are you not living in a field? There's a vegan in my office who is constantly eating snacks out of a packet, in a similar way to how a cow munches on grass. She then goes and throws her packet of crisps into a bin. She's not eating crisps out of a packet because it's how she would want to live her life if she was a crisp packet; she's eating crisps out of a packet because it's the most convenient way for her to eat crisps, and then she's throwing the packet away. Humans don't live out their lives in fields because it's inconvenient. There are no shops, there's no internet. So if you're a vegan who doesn't want animals to be killed, then I would say you should be living out your life in a field. Otherwise, it's a bit of a double standard. The thing that upsets me about vegans is that they don't seem to realise how lucky they are to be human. They're always banging on about how cows should be allowed to live out their days in a field, when that's exactly what cows do. They're always banging on about how cows shouldn't be killed for food, when they've been eating grass their entire lives. There are so many benefits to being a human. It's a bit weird when you think about it, isn't it? Like, if I woke up in the morning and I was a cow, I'd be pretty fucked off, because I wouldn't be able to do anything I like doing. I wouldn't be able to watch RuPaul's Drag Race , or go for a nice dinner, or read a book, or enjoy a good masturbate. I'd just be munching on grass and shitting all day. I'd be in a field, shitting, and then it would be night-time, and I'd be a cow, shitting. And then, because I was a cow, I'd be allowed to live out my days shitting in a field. I'd be allowed to live out my days shitting in a field. I'd be allowed to live out my days shitting in a field. I'd be allowed to live out my days shitting in a field.

But really I think it's all about having fun with your animals! If you've got an elderly loved one who needs companionship then maybe offer to help out at the dairy.

They are also social animals that have close bonds with other members of their herd. While they may not display the same level of self-awareness as humans or other highly intelligent animals, they are still capable of feeling and experiencing the world around them."
Tsinghua,cmv-148,"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. Even the term Holocaust was an unfortunate choice of words - it implied the Holocaust was an accident. In fact, it was an intentional policy of the Nazi regime. When I was a young boy, the Holocaust was the only example of genocide in my education. That's when I decided to dedicate my life to studying genocide, and specifically, the genocide of the Jewish people. The Holocaust was a watershed moment in my life. It taught me that the Holocaust was a part of human history, not just the history of my people. It taught me that genocide is a fact of life, that genocide is not just a theoretical issue, but a problem of our time. I was only a young boy when I made that discovery. Today, I am a full-time genocide researcher and advocate. I am also the director of the Institute for Genocide Research and Prevention at the University of British Columbia. My research focuses on the experience of Jewish genocide in Europe and North America. I am the author of a book entitled ""Genocide in Canada: The First Holocaust,"" which was published in 2007. My book, as well as my articles and public presentations, have focused on the lessons learned from the Holocaust. I have also worked with survivors of genocide to share their stories with the public. This includes the first ever Canadian-Jewish Holocaust survivor tour, which brought survivors of the Holocaust to Vancouver in 2007. This is my 25th year as a survivor educator, and my 25th year of research into genocide. My personal commitment to educating Canadians about the Holocaust has led me to a full-time commitment to genocide research and prevention. As the director of the Institute for Genocide Research and Prevention, I have established a strong research team, which includes two PhD students and a postdoctoral fellow. We have established a strong relationship with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Mediator on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. We have a strong and active collaboration with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Our research focuses on the experience of Jewish genocide in Europe and North America. We have also worked with UN researchers in the field of genocide research, and we are collaborating with the Canadian Jewish Congress and other Canadian organizations. The Institute for Genocide Research and Prevention also works to raise public awareness about the Holocaust. I am the founding director of the Canadian Holocaust Memorial Day and the Holocaust Survivors' Association of Canada. The Canadian Holocaust Memorial Day is an annual commemoration of the victims of genocide in Canada. The Memorial Day is held on the first Sunday in May, and this year marks the 20th anniversary of the first Memorial Day. The 2016 Memorial Day was a significant milestone. The Holocaust Survivors' Association of Canada is a national association of Holocaust survivors and Holocaust descendants. It is the only national association in Canada that is exclusively focused on the experience of Jewish genocide in Canada. The Association has been in existence for over 30 years, and is currently the oldest surviving Holocaust survivor association in Canada. The Holocaust Survivors' Association of Canada has established an annual scholarship program, which awards a 10,000 scholarship to an outstanding undergraduate or graduate student who is studying the Holocaust. The Association also has a Holocaust education program, which brings Holocaust survivors and descendants to schools and universities throughout the country to share their experiences with the public. My personal commitment to genocide research and prevention has led me to a full-time commitment to genocide research and prevention. My research focuses on the experience of Jewish genocide in Europe and North America. I am the author of a book entitled ""Genocide in Canada: The First Holocaust,"" which was published in 2007. My book, as well as my articles and public presentations, have focused on the lessons learned from the Holocaust. I have also worked with survivors of genocide to share their stories with the public. This includes the first ever Canadian-Jewish Holocaust survivor tour, which brought survivors of the Holocaust to Vancouver in 2007. This is my 25th year as a survivor educator, and my 25th year of research into genocide. My personal commitment to educating Canadians about the Holocaust has led me to a full-time commitment to genocide research and prevention. As the director of the Institute for Genocide Research and Prevention, I have established a strong research team, which includes two PhD students and a postdoctoral fellow. We have established a strong relationship with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Mediator on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. We have a strong and active collaboration with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Our research focuses on the experience of Jewish genocide in Europe and North America."
OpenAI,cmv-148,"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. It is true that throughout Jewish history, Jews have faced persecution and threats of extermination from various societies and governments. From ancient times to the present day, Jews have been targeted for their religious beliefs and cultural differences. One of the most devastating examples of this persecution was during the Holocaust, when the Nazi regime in Germany systematically killed millions of Jews in concentration camps. However, it's important to note that not all non-Jewish societies have been hostile to Jews. In fact, many Jewish communities have coexisted peacefully with their non-Jewish neighbors throughout history. It's also worth noting that Jewish culture has greatly enriched the societies in which Jews have lived, contributing to art, science, literature, and philosophy. While it's important to be mindful of the history of anti-Semitism, it's equally important to recognize the diversity and positive contributions of Jewish people and to work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant society for all people."

It shouldn't hurt to learn about it. We have a lot going on here (and elsewhere) right now - so let's get this out of the way first: Judaism is not an easy religion to understand. The basic tenets of our faith can be confusing, even scary at times, but there's no denying they're worth knowing if you want your life to make sense. Jewish history has been filled with misconceptions created by unscrupulous people who tried to manipulate facts for their own ends. (Note: As someone whose ancestors were persecuted by Stalinists during World War II, it's especially important to me to educate myself as much as possible!) The following explanation came from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, founder of Modern Orthodoxy - Free Torah Movement author of Understanding Jewish History and Guide to the Bible's Prophecies The simple truth is this: For many centuries before Jesus walked among us, millions of Israelites lived free men or women. They had no king, no princes or emperors, no priesthood, no temple, no schools; no laws nor taxes, no idols, no superstition whatsoever... In fact, for all intents and purposes, these people didn't exist except along the coasts where the seas met one another, because everywhere else, how could any human beings possibly live without God? However, when King David defeated Goliath and became king over his kingdom of Israel, he saw himself surrounded by enemies uncountable in number - kings and mighty warriors fighting him tooth-and-claw every step of the way, until finally he died! At least fifty different nationalities inhabited what we call modern-day Israel today, including Phoenicians, Philistines, Babylonians, Assyrians, Medes, Greeks, Syrians, Phrygians, Hittite Kings, Egyptian Pharaohs, Persian scribes, dervishes, Scythian tribesmen, Ethiopian Kaffirs... And yet somehow, despite having such diverse populations across hundreds of years, the nation has never divided into parties, rebelled against its rulers, become a colony of other nations, fought wars against each other, demanded independence from them, sought foreign conquests, set aside sacred sites, built military bases and secret facilities around holy places, oppressed minorities, imprisoned dissidents, instigated terrorist acts, worshipped false gods, profaned holy places, destroyed historic artifacts... I've spent thousands upon thousands of hours traveling through biblical lands, studying their historical records, recounting their stories as told by eyewitnesses, then translating those events into English so everyone could read, listen, and study them. I've done this work both professionally and privately for thirty-six years; working day and night, weekdays and weekends, collecting evidence and researching my findings while still living the rest of my days amongst others who also wanted to do something meaningful for posterity regarding the past, present, and future of mankind. I am often asked why I haven't written books alone using constitutional procedures? Why did I seek approval via professional legal channels rather than publishing my writings solely online? This question begs two very obvious answers: First, I'm neither a person of low self esteem nor vain enough to try to hide behind a pseudonym, which would certainly brazenly violate copyright law. Second, most scientists, historians, academics, authors, journalists, political figures, religious leaders, philosophers, and scholars will tell you: Only doing significant things publicly requires public authorization or acknowledgement. This blog page is intended to allow anyone to visit these pages and see exactly how well I know my subject matter and what kind of credentials I've put together; hopefully making it easier to trust my words and statements instead of taking everything only word-for-word like so many otherwise intelligent citizens seem unable to apply logic or reason when hearing claims made by politicians, celebrities, and so-called experts claiming to have ""proof"" that Christianity exists based purely on scientific studies conducted by atheistic researchers. There are absolutely massive problems facing our culture right now involving vast amounts of money being given to huge corporations run by corrupt corporate CEOs who are raping and pillaging American taxpayers' dollars; enabling them to influence government policies concerning issues ranging from climate change hoaxes to child abuse accusations and fraudulent medical practices to demonizing alternative medicines and health care professionals (e.g., naturopathy doctors, chiropractors, herbalists, acupuncturists). And amidst all of this madness involved with big business and mysterious organizations called ""CIA, FBI, DHS, DARPA, NSA,"" many people remain totally ignorant andor confused about exactly what type of organization (s) control the U.S. Government, as well as private businesses for profit interests; and the extent to which powerful individuals within various governments are prepared to go to ensure the continued expansion and domination of global capitalism supported mostly by cutting edge technology used to transform entire countries into small isolated islands controlled"

LLAMA,cmv-148,"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. We were also taught that we have to be grateful that Canada, America, and Israel are our safe havens. So I was shocked to learn from an Israeli Jew (and the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) that Israel has been mistreating the Ethiopian Jews who emigrated there. Why is it that Jews in every generation are persecuted? Ethiopian Jews in Israel I'm grateful to have read the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber's I and Thou. Buber wrote: ""To be sure, the world is full of perils, and in it destruction threatens us. But we must not perish in it through love. We must love it and hate none of the things which it please God to manifest in it."" There are forces of destruction in the world - not just physical destruction, but also the destruction of humanity and the planet. But when we respond with fear, hate, and vengeance, we are no better than our enemies. Buber wrote that we must recognize the divine spark in all people, and all of life. ""Love the world and do not despair. The more you know it, the more you will be able to love it."" Hating anything in the world, or the world itself, is a recipe for despair. ""We do not have to be able to do everything. It is enough that each of us should do what we are able to do."" In the face of the destruction of the world, we can feel overwhelmed and powerless. But we can each do our part, and we can support one another in doing so. This is the true meaning of community. When we work together to build a more just, peaceful, and sustainable world, then we can be sure that our lives have meaning. The forces of destruction may win in the end - but it's not inevitable. And even if the world is destroyed, we can still live our lives with integrity and meaning. It is enough that each of us should do what we are able to do. Today is my son's 11th birthday. Growing up, my son loved the X-Men comics and movies. He has identified with the mutant superheroes who must hide their identities for fear of being persecuted. As a father, I've always encouraged my son to be himself and embrace his differences. In the X-Men universe, ""coming out"" as a mutant is called ""passing the test of the Shadow."" When the X-Men were young, their mentor Professor Xavier gave them a test to discover whether they were truly mutants. The Shadow King created illusions to frighten each of the X-Men. Professor Xavier explained that the test was not whether the X-Men would succeed in overcoming the illusions. But whether they would keep their cool, control their fear, and use their powers to protect one another. I've tried to teach my son to take his tests in life with calmness and compassion. My son was born with severe developmental disabilities. For the past few years, he's been asking me whether he's ""normal."" I tell him that we all have our strengths and weaknesses. My son has incredible strengths that many ""normal"" people don't have. But at school, my son is mercilessly teased for his weaknesses. I've been a teacher for over 20 years, and I've witnessed the same pattern over and over. The kids who don't ""fit in"" are persecuted. And those who don't join in the persecution are ridiculed as ""losers"" and ""nerds."" We all have a choice about what kind of world we want to create. We can create a world in which people are persecuted for being different. Or we can create a world in which diversity is embraced and celebrated. It is my hope that my son will ""pass the test of the Shadow"" - and so will you."
Human,cmv-148,"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date. There is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group. The Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair. Meanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a ""self-hating Jew,"" although I think this only reinforces my point. Will someone change my view?"
OpenAI,cmv-149,"I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been difficult for me to understand the fascination with hitting a tiny ball into a hole. However, I've come to appreciate the sport more over time, as I've learned more about the technical skill and mental focus required to excel at golf. Golf requires precise coordination between the hands, arms, shoulders, hips, and legs to execute a swing that generates maximum power and accuracy. It also demands a great deal of mental toughness, as players need to maintain focus and perform under pressure over the course of four long days in tournaments. Ultimately, like any sport, golf may not be for everyone. But for those who appreciate the challenges and rewards of the game, it can be a deeply satisfying and fulfilling pursuit."

I'm not sure what got into me at all today though... except for maybe watching one kid on TV say ""Here's your ball!"" And then there was this guy who kept getting kicked out of his clubhouse every time he hit anything other than an imaginary green... It reminded me so much of how long ago we were playing with friends once when they had four balls numbered 1 through 4 laying around, which meant that if everyone picked up their number's ball (which could be either red or blue) they'd have ALL the different colors of balls! Then we'd play ""Football"" where our goal would be to pick two things off the ground without touching those same two objects twice. (For example, picking three flowers from the dirt before reaching back again.) After 3 failures, someone would get sent downstairs to get more food, while another person moved up to replace him as player 1. To make matters worse, these games seemed to reinforce each others' existence by having people gather together, even after their game ended... (eg: the guys who left early aren't going home now because they're waiting for us!) The only thing that worked is if a new set of players came over first thing in the morning.

It's always been boring to me, and it seems that when compared to other sports, golf takes the least skill. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way. Edit: People have pointed out that there are sports that take less skill, like Frisbee and swimming. I guess I was thinking of the slightly more mainstream sports. But my point still stands, aside from that."
LLAMA,cmv-149,"I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been the one I have said ""I can't do that."" Until yesterday. Yesterday I played golf. For the first time. I didn't do horribly. I didn't do great. I hit the ball pretty well when I was teeing off, not so well when I was on the fairway (I don't think I hit the fairway one time), but I did OK. A few weeks ago I was talking to a friend of mine and she said she was going to go golfing and she didn't really like it and didn't really know what to do. I told her I didn't really like it either and if she wanted I would go with her. So we scheduled a time and headed out. There were a couple of other people with us, one of which was a golf pro. We all were just trying to do our best to have fun, and I think we did a pretty good job. I actually hit the ball a few times pretty well. I hit the ball so hard on one shot that I had to replace the head of my club. The head of the club broke off. I hit it so hard that I had to replace it. And the people were great. They were all very supportive and wanted to make sure I had a good time. They were very good to me and I hope we can all go out again. So I am a golfer now. I think I am going to work on my short game for a while. I am going to try and get some more distance on my clubs. And I am going to try and learn how to putt a little better. But I am a golfer now. I can finally say it. A golfer. I can't believe I am a golfer. Haha! Love it. I really want to play again. It was a lot of fun. And a good workout. I am going to have to go again. I need to fix my short game. I know how to swing a club, I just don't know how to get it to go straight."

It’s a beautiful game, and it can be very relaxing. But for me, it’s just not worth the hassle. I’d rather spend my time doing something that I’m actually good at.

I have other things to do with my life, and I don’t want to spend all day on the golf course. I also hate the fact that golf is so expensive. The cost of equipment, green fees, and lessons can add up quickly. And if you’re not good at the game, you’re going to lose a lot of money. Finally, I hate the fact that golf is so frustrating. It’s a game where you can do everything right and still not score well. That’s incredibly frustrating, and it’s not something I’m willing to put up with.

Tsinghua,cmv-150,"I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like an actual [deus ex machina]...or a God's gift. The idea of a chemical element with the highest possible nuclear spin...I mean, just to use this as a running example, let's take the nucleus of the ununpentium atom. It would be the highest nuclear spin possible in a nucleus, and yet, it's still the same nucleus as the one that we have for the element with the next highest nuclear spin, [ununtrium] . Now, if we could make a particle with the highest possible nuclear spin, would it be the same nucleus as the particle with the next highest nuclear spin, and if so, would it be a stable nucleus? The reason I ask this question is because I'm trying to figure out how stable the most stable nucleus of a chemical element is, and I'm wondering if the idea of a particle with the highest possible nuclear spin is the reason why the most stable nucleus of a chemical element is stable. Or is it because of something else? A: The reason the nucleus of an ununpentium atom has the highest nuclear spin possible is that the 2 electrons are in a lowest energy orbit and can't move to a higher energy orbit. This is similar to the reason why the nucleus of a helium atom has the lowest energy possible, which is because it is the lowest energy orbital that can contain an electron. There is no reason why the most stable nucleus would be stable."
LLAMA,cmv-150,"I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost an arbitrary thing to say that an element can be synthesized. I understand that we can only detect things we can detect, but, for example, if we were to take a sample of [dilithium], we would be unable to detect any elements in it. Does that mean that dilithium doesn't contain any elements? No, we'd just have to detect it some other way. We have strong evidence that there are particles and elements that we don't have the ability to detect yet, but we can infer their existence by the way they interact with the universe around them. It's been my experience that things that are ""undetectable"" are just undetectable to our current methods of detection. So when I read that [ununpentium] has been detected for only one millisecond, does that mean it's unstable and thus not viable for synthesis? And if it's only detectable for one millisecond, what does that say about all the elements we CAN'T detect that are out there? I'm not saying that these heavier elements are impossible to synthesize, just that we haven't figured out how to do it yet. I wonder what the experimental error rate is on these measurements. How do we know that there's a one-millisecond half-life as opposed to a 200-millisecond half-life? How accurate is our equipment? It's also a little suspicious that these elements are named after great scientists, almost as if it's more of a game than a science. To me, it feels a bit like trying to put a puzzle together without all the pieces, and when you can't find a piece, you just make one up. I'm not saying we shouldn't be doing this, but it does feel like it's a little more speculative than we're giving it credit for."
Human,cmv-150,"I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table. The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab. Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look! I've created a bookbottle!"" The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it. Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements. Change my view. EDIT: Wow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. What I've learned: Short half life It's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive. Very few atoms at a time This is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova. Not outside the lab. Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms. There are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion."

Is there anything you can tell me about these elements? Certainly! Ununpentium and ununtrium are two highly unstable elements that are classified as superheavy elements. Ununpentium is also known as element 115, while ununtrium is also known as element 113. These elements were first synthesized in the early 2000s, and very little is known about their properties. Because they are highly unstable, ununpentium and ununtrium only exist for a fraction of a second before decaying into other elements. As a result, they have no practical applications and are only studied for their scientific value. Despite their instability, scientists believe that superheavy elements like ununpentium and ununtrium may have certain unique properties that could be useful in advanced materials or nuclear technologies. However, much more research is needed before we can fully understand these elements and their potential applications."
PaLM,cmv-151,"I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being either, but I do think there are some good arguments for both sides. Arguments for being a vegetarian:  Animal welfare: Vegetarianism is often seen as a way to reduce the suffering of animals. By not eating meat, you are helping to ensure that fewer animals are raised and slaughtered for human consumption.  Environmental impact: Meat production has a significant environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and deforestation. Vegetarianism can help to reduce this impact by reducing the demand for meat.  Health benefits: A vegetarian diet can be healthier than a diet that includes meat. Vegetarians tend to have lower rates of heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Arguments for being a vegan:  Animal welfare: Veganism is the most ethical choice for those who are concerned about the welfare of animals. By not eating any animal products, you are helping to ensure that no animals are harmed for your food.  Environmental impact: Veganism has an even greater environmental impact than vegetarianism. By not consuming any animal products, you are helping to reduce the demand for meat, dairy, and eggs, which in turn reduces the environmental impact of these industries.  Health benefits: A vegan diet can be even healthier than a vegetarian diet. Vegans tend to have even lower rates of heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Conclusion: Ultimately, the decision of whether to become a vegetarian or a vegan is a personal one. There are good arguments to be made for both sides. However, I believe that the most ethical choice is to adopt a plant-based diet, whether that means becoming a vegetarian or a vegan.

When we're together there's always enough antibodies around circulating within all those different peoples' bloodstreams which effectively neutralizes anything harmful before it gets into your system at least long-term if they haven't had any exposure already through travel etc where maybe less herd effect occurs but still happens..

LLAMA,cmv-151,"I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being a vegan but there are very strong reasons for being a vegetarian. I've been on the brink of going back to being vegan for a while now, and I'm sure I will eventually, but I'm not at that point yet. Anyway, I've been thinking about the way meat eaters like to trot out the old ""but we're omnivores"" argument, and I've been thinking about how some vegans like to dismiss this, saying that we're really herbivores but we're just not evolved enough yet, or that we're naturally herbivores but we've had our instincts perverted by modern society. I'm not sure how anyone can be so sure about this. Looking at the anatomy of the human body I can't see any real evidence that we're naturally herbivores - we don't have the teeth and we don't have the digestive system, although I suppose we have the teeth and digestive system of an omnivore. I know we're similar to chimps but chimps are omnivores too, and they hunt and eat meat. There's no doubt that humans have been eating meat for tens of thousands of years, and maybe longer than that. I don't see any reason why we're not naturally omnivores, but at the same time I don't see any reason why we should be. It's true that meat is less healthy than vegetables, and eating meat is more expensive than eating veggies, and it's also true that we could feed more people on the same land if we weren't growing food for animals. Those arguments don't convince me that eating meat is wrong, though. There are lots of things we do that are less healthy or more expensive than other options, and there are lots of things we do that make less efficient use of resources than other options, but I don't think they're wrong. Anyway, I've been thinking about this, and I wonder if it's even the right question. Maybe it's not a question of whether we're naturally herbivores or omnivores. Maybe the question should be whether we're naturally carnivores or omnivores. It's true that we can digest vegetables better than meat. It's also true that we can digest meat better than cows can digest meat. But it's also true that we can digest meat better than cows can digest vegetables. I'm sure if you compared the human digestive system to a cow's digestive system you'd find that they're quite different, and I'm sure you'd find that one system is better at digesting meat and one system is better at digesting vegetables. So it seems to me that the human digestive system is more similar to the cow's digestive system than it is to a chimp's digestive system. Maybe we're naturally more like carnivores than omnivores. Maybe we're more like cows than chimps. I know this sounds far fetched, but the thing is, chimps eat meat. If you give a chimp the choice between meat and vegetables, the chimp will eat meat. It's true that chimps don't hunt, but they will eat meat if it's available. They'll even eat other primates. Cows don't eat meat. I'm sure that if you gave a cow a choice between meat and vegetables, the cow would eat the vegetables. It seems to me that this makes the human digestive system more similar to the cow's digestive system than to the chimp's digestive system. So I'm not sure I can agree that we're naturally herbivores or even that we're naturally omnivores. I think maybe we're naturally carnivores. Maybe we're just not evolved enough yet. Mankind's natural diet - a vegan diet I don't know what our natural diet is - but I do know what I'm going to eat for my dinner tonight - and that's pizza. This is all very interesting, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm going to eat pizza tonight"

BigScience,cmv-151,"I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being vegetarian on medical grounds especially if you've only had it as an occasional thing over the years. But we do know that nicotine has effects which are similar to those of plant-derived hormones like estrogen or progesterone because animal models treat them similarly (see here). Since smoking isn't technically healthy either it's just about always better far more environmentally friendly than consuming things made from animals.. But this is not much different than other vegetarians who eat margarine with their eggs. No one really thinks eating chocolate leads to brain damage but they won't say anything unless asked directly. The same goes for meat. Vegans may be right in arguing that feeding certain plants into farm animals causes harm; however there is no scientific evidence backing up what they're saying. I can't speak to anyone else's experience but my own has never changed me at all - to the point where I haven't even tried another cigarette since quitting. If any day I'd get back onto cigs now it would probably take me months before getting used to them again, so I'll happily keep doing without until then. Come on people! It smells very bad but that's why you're smoking cigarettes and not sweet waxed tobacco! Well actually the answer is likely yes. It's been shown time and time again by studies that male smokers have lower sperm counts compared to non-smokers; however whether these matters greatly depends upon how long they've smoked. Women are less affected though. This doesn't mean that following a strict diet would necessarily improve your chances at having children - both men and women need enough nutrients throughout their lives to ensure good health overall. But for those people wishing to start trying to conceive some changes such as cutting out alcohol could help. I've said it once before...and will say it many times more..i've heardread alot of ""arguments,""but i see none of the proof..didn't expect to find the answers after reading posts on here!But i'm glad there's still some rational thinking left! Exactly. Tackling this issue head-on does seem to bring results and should continue to come across our screens regardless of level of credibility. It's simply a difference between two views, like watching baseball fans argue opposite issues: home run batters vs fielders Interesting link - perhaps something for Nicaraguan government officials to consider? One side calls themselves the revolutionaries, the other side the counter-revolutionaries... Would love to hear opinions regarding an upcoming article on ""The Common Sense Way,"" I'm sure you'll agree these arguments aren't new nor surprising. As far as I am concerned, the problem lies within legalization itself rather than believing the claims paid off by some individuals. That means nothing is going to change except the 'consumers' perception of it. Even Americans think marijuana is dangerous, yet it remains legal in most states. In fact, to this date fewer deaths occurred due to using cannabis freely than were lost due to drinking as well as traffic accidents."
OpenAI,cmv-151,"I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being vegan based on health alone, since it's possible to be healthy with a diet that includes some animal products. However, many people choose to be vegan for ethical or environmental reasons, so those arguments can be quite compelling. From an ethical standpoint, avoiding animal products supports the idea that animals should not be exploited or killed for the pleasure, convenience, or profit of humans. Many people believe that this ethical stance can extend to other areas of life, such as clothing and personal care products, where animals may be used in testing or production. From an environmental standpoint, animal agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. By avoiding animal products, one can reduce their impact on the environment. Ultimately, the decision to be vegan is a personal one and should be based on an individual's values and priorities. It's important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks, and to seek out reliable sources of information and support to help make an informed decision."
Human,cmv-151,"I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being veggie, unless you refer to climate change, and once you look at that I think the case for being vegan is unanswerable, I still have regrets that I'm not vegan, although not major ones, as otherwise I'd not eat pizza quite so much. That said I do think there is also an ethical argument against harming animals who can feel pain and have a capacity to suffer. I certainly think this is the case with most medium to large size mammals like cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, dolphins and whatnot. For that reason I wouldn't eat those animals even if it was sustainable to do so, unless I was sure they had been reared and killed humanely. When it comes to animals who are clearly less conscious I don't feel the same way. I don't have any qualms about swatting flies, and I also recognise the need for pest control. I wouldn't have any problem with lethal rat traps being used in a restaurant (although obviously that should go hand in hand with taking measures to discourage them being in the kitchen in the first place like not leaving food out overnight). I don't know if fish can experience pain or not. I don't know if they can suffer like other higher mammals can. As I don't know for sure, I'm reluctant to join in with the fishing that'll take place when we go and stay with my partners family at a cottage near a river which allows for excellent fishing. I quite like the idea of fly fishing, I feels it's pretty sustainable (I might be wrong), and also that fish probably don't have the mental capacity to suffer (I might be wrong again). I'd rather avoid doing something I'll learn that I shouldn't have done in 20 years though than take the risk. CMV Convinced by Delta's awarded. Hello, users of CMV!

PaLM,cmv-152,"The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, though. The Big Bang Theory is the leading scientific theory for how the universe began. The Big Bang Theory states that about 13.8 billion years ago, all of the matter and energy in the universe was concentrated into a very hot, dense point. This point was so hot that no light could escape it, and so the universe was completely dark. Then, about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began to expand and cool. As the universe expanded, the matter and energy in it began to spread out and cool down. Eventually, the universe became cool enough for light to escape, and the first stars and galaxies were born. The Big Bang Theory is supported by a number of observations, including the fact that the universe is expanding and the cosmic microwave background radiation. The cosmic microwave background radiation is a faint glow of light that is everywhere in the universe. This radiation is the leftover heat from the Big Bang, and it is evidence that the universe was once very hot and dense. The Big Bang Theory is not without its critics. Some critics argue that the theory does not explain why the universe is expanding, or why it is so uniform. Others argue that the theory does not explain the existence of dark matter and dark energy, which are two mysterious forms of matter and energy that make up most of the universe. Despite these criticisms, the Big Bang Theory is the leading scientific theory for how the universe began. It is a well-supported theory that explains a number of observations about the universe. The Big Bang Theory is a powerful tool that helps us understand the history of the universe and our place in it."

Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and we have many theories about how it might have happened. The most widely accepted scientific theory is the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the universe began as a super-hot and dense singularity, about 13.8 billion years ago. However, there are still many unanswered questions about what came before the Big Bang, and how the universe evolved to its current state. Scientists continue to explore these questions through further observations and experiments, and we can hope to gain a better understanding of the origins of the universe in the future."
LLAMA,cmv-152,"The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, but we don't know exactly how. So, a theist might say that God created the universe, the universe is the result of the action of God. This creates a logical conundrum: Is God the result of the action of another entity? If the answer is no, then how could the universe be the result of God, but God is not the result of another entity? If the answer is yes, then what created this other entity? What created the creator of the creator? This argument is known as the First Cause Argument, and it's a fairly common one. Why is this a problem? Well, the argument assumes that everything has a cause, and therefore the universe must have a cause. The universe must have been created by something, which also must have been created by something, and so on. This is a logical fallacy called the Fallacy of Composition. The fallacy of composition is to assume that what is true of the part is true of the whole. For example, the assumption that each atom in my body is made of protons and neutrons, and therefore my body is made of protons and neutrons. This is clearly false. In the case of the First Cause argument, the assumption is that everything has a cause, and therefore the universe must have a cause. This is clearly false, because not everything has a cause. For example, in quantum mechanics there is the phenomenon of quantum tunnelling. A particle can spontaneously appear in a place where it should not exist. There is no cause, and no explanation for this. A better answer to the question ""What created the universe?"" is: ""The universe was not created. It's always been."" But the universe cannot be eternal! It is untrue to say that the universe cannot be eternal. The universe is not a clockwork mechanism. The universe is a non-deterministic quantum system. It is true to say that we don't know exactly how the universe came in to being. It is untrue to say that we don't know that the universe is eternal. You see, the universe is a singularity. It is not a separate entity to the space that it contains. If the universe were to stop existing, then so would space, and so would everything else. The universe could have been expanding and contracting in an endless cycle. When the universe contracts to a point, it's gravitational energy becomes so great that it causes another big bang, and the universe expands again. This is known as the Oscillating Universe theory, and it's not as far fetched as it sounds. There are many cosmologists who are starting to subscribe to this theory. So, we have a universe that is eternal, that always has been, and always will be. There was never a first cause. The universe was not created. Now, theists will say that they don't mean to say that the universe was created. They mean to say that God created the universe. This is a semantic argument. The First Cause argument assumes that everything has a cause. It doesn't distinguish between the universe and God. If the universe requires a cause, then so does God. And if the universe does not require a cause, then neither does God. Labels: cosmology, first cause argument, fallacy, fallacy of composition, god, quantum mechanics, quantum tunnelling, universe Why the Kalam Cosmological Argument fails The Kalam Cosmological Argument is often used by theists to prove the existence of God. It is based on the idea that everything must have a cause. It is a logical fallacy. Everything must have a cause The universe had a cause Therefore the universe was created by God Everything must have a cause is the fallacy. Let me demonstrate with an example. A Universe is created from nothing. The Universe spawns a number of particles. These particles collide, and form atoms. These atoms coalesce to form molecules. These molecules are the building blocks of planets and stars. These planets and stars form galaxies. These galaxies are the building blocks of super clusters. These super clusters are the building blocks of the entire universe. This is an accurate description of our universe. But, if everything must have a cause, then what was the cause of the universe? What caused the particles to collide and form atoms? What caused"

Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and roughly how it did, but what caused it to come in to being is a unanswered question - one we may never answer. There are others that believe God brought the Universe in to being (that is, an all powerful entity was the first-mover, setting the universe in motion). But if God is all powerful and infinite, we have no idea what HisHerits nature is, and couldn't possibly know, as mortal, finite beings. What is the difference between saying we don't know how the universe came in to being, and saying that this entity that we don't know the nature of, and couldn't possibly comprehend, brought the universe in to being?

Tsinghua,cmv-152,"The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and what it looked like in the beginning. (In fact, we know pretty much everything except what exactly happened in the very beginning, but we'll get to that in a minute.) But it's clear that the universe has a beginning, and that we are a part of it. So what about the afterlife? Is there one? I'm not an expert on this, but I've heard that a large percentage of scientists believe that there is an afterlife. It's not quite the same thing as an eternal afterlife, but it's a big improvement on the kind of afterlife that you get if you die without God. But then again, we don't really know what happens when you die. We don't know if we're all going to go to Heaven or Hell, or some other kind of place, or what. So I guess the best thing to do is to make the best of your time on Earth, and to do your best to live a good life. It's not so easy, though, because it's easy to let your anger and frustration get the better of you, or to let your fear take over. But you can try. Don't let the things you can't change get you down. You might want to take a look at this song, by John Lennon, called ""Give Peace a Chance."" And the best thing you can do is to remember that there's always going to be something better than this. You might have to wait a long time for it, but it's there, and you can't do anything about it now, so you might as well just wait. You might have to wait until you're a very old man or a very old woman, but when you get to that point, you'll probably have forgotten all about the problem. It might be a good idea to keep a little diary or journal, just to remind yourself that there's a better world out there. (If you don't have a journal, you can make one up, just to keep your memory of the things you've learned about life, and about death.) This will help you remember the things that you've learned, and maybe it will help you remember how to behave, and maybe it will help you remember that you're not the only person on the planet, and maybe it will help you remember that you're not the only person in the universe. (I'm sure that you've heard that scientists have found other planets in the universe, so you might not be the only person in the universe. But you are the only person in your immediate vicinity. So there's a lot of room for you to grow, and to do a lot of good things.) You might have to wait a long time, but you can't do anything about it now. And even if you can't do anything about it now, it doesn't mean that you have to do nothing. And it doesn't mean that you have to give up on yourself. And it doesn't mean that you have to be pessimistic about your chances. And it doesn't mean that you have to think that you're not going to have a better life, or that you're not going to be happy. You're going to have a better life, and you're going to be happy. But it's going to take a lot of hard work. So if you want to have a better life, you have to work for it. And you have to do your best to be happy. You have to be kind to others, and you have to help others, and you have to be generous with your time and your money. You have to be generous with your time, and your money, and your love. You have to do your best to give as much of yourself as you can. And you have to try to think that you're going to be happy, and that you're going to have a better life. You have to try to think that there's a God, and that there's a heaven, and that there's a hell. And you have to try to think that you're going to be in heaven, and that you're going to be in hell. You have to try to think that you're going to be happy, and that you're going to have a better life. You have to try to be optimistic about your future. You have to try to be positive. And you have to try to be good. You have to try to do your best to be good, and to be kind, and to be generous, and to be honest."
OpenAI,cmv-153,"With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more accountability measures in place to prevent unnecessary use of force by law enforcement. Some of the measures that could be taken include: 1. Mandatory body cameras for all police officers: Body cameras have been shown to reduce the use of force and improve police accountability. They ensure that all interactions between the police and the public are recorded and can be used as evidence in case of complaints or investigations. 2. Increased training in de-escalation techniques: Police officers should receive regular training in how to de-escalate situations and avoid the use of force. Studies have shown that de-escalation techniques can be very effective in preventing police killings. 3. Independent investigations: When there is an incident involving a police shooting or use of force, an independent agency should conduct an investigation. This will ensure that there is no bias or conflict of interest in the investigation. 4. Police accountability measures: Police officers who use excessive force or engage in unlawful behavior should face consequences for their actions. This could include reprimand, suspension, termination, or criminal charges. 5. Community involvement: Communities should be involved in the oversight of law enforcement. Police should be required to engage with the community and work with them to build trust and understanding. Community members should have a voice in the review of police policies and procedures. By implementing these measures, it is possible to create a more accountable and responsible law enforcement system that is fair and just for all."
Tsinghua,cmv-153,"With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more focus on the victims and the cases that go uninvestigated. Police shootings of innocent people in the US is not as uncommon as you may think. We've seen this pattern in many countries. Police kill disproportionately people who are of color, and often in racist ways. We have to talk about the victims. We have to stop pretending that it is just an isolated incident, and the real problem is just the perpetrators. I think we can and should make more efforts to keep these cases alive and the victims alive. Police shootings are not just about the crime or the crime-fighter, they are about the victim."
LLAMA,cmv-153,"With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more training for officers. The purpose of this essay is to show the issue of police killing citizens and the fact that they need more training. The question is, what is a solution to this issue? I believe that police officers should be trained in the use of a gun and also non lethal ways of taking down a suspect. I think that there should be more training on when to use your gun or other ways of taking down a suspect. I think that this could prevent many more deaths. First of all, there needs to be more training on when to use a gun. Officers should not pull out their gun at all unless they know the suspect has a gun or they feel threatened in some way. I think that if the officer thinks the suspect has a gun that he needs to call for backup and have the suspect put their hands up. If the suspect is not being compliant with the officer, then the officer can pull out his gun, but only if the officer feels threatened. If the officer feels like the suspect could have a gun, then the officer should use a less lethal option to take down the suspect. This would prevent officers from shooting people that they are not sure if they have a gun or not. Second of all, officers need to be trained in the use of a gun. They should have a good knowledge on where to shoot a suspect. They should shoot to injure, not kill. Officers should be trained to shoot in a place where the suspect can still live and receive medical treatment. This could prevent many more deaths. Officers should also be trained in the use of non lethal force. Officers should be trained in the use of stun guns or tasers. Officers should also be trained in different ways to take down a suspect without using a gun or a taser. For example, they could use a baton to take down a suspect. They should be trained in different ways to take down a suspect so that the officer can feel safe without killing someone. Lastly, officers should be trained in the use of non lethal force. This could prevent many more deaths in the United States. This would allow police officers to take down suspects and not have to kill them. If officers are trained in different ways to take down a suspect then this could prevent many deaths in the United States. Police officers could use pepper spray, a baton, taser, or stun gun to take down a suspect. This would prevent officers from having to use lethal force. In conclusion, I think that if police officers are better trained in the use of guns and non lethal force, then there would be fewer deaths in the United States. Officers should be trained in the use of a gun and where to shoot a suspect. They should also be trained in the use of different ways to take down a suspect. Officers should be trained in the use of stun guns or tasers. Officers should also be trained in different ways to take down a suspect without using a gun or a taser. For example, they could use a baton to take down a suspect. They should be trained in different ways to take down a suspect so that the officer can feel safe without killing someone.

Improving the Police ForceSafety in America Erin, I agree with your article that there needs to be more training for police officers in the United States. This is a very serious issue because the number of people that are killed by police officers is growing larger and larger. One thing that you could include in your essay is how the issue is affecting people's lives. For example, what are the families of the victims doing after these incidents? Erin, I totally agree with your essay on how police officers should be more trained. I think that police officers should go through more training in order to keep our citizens safe. There are too many police shootings and they need to be prevented. I agree that there needs to be more training for police officers. It is becoming more and more common that police officers are using excessive force to arrest citizens. Police officers need to be trained to know when to use their weapons and when to use other tactics to control a situation. I think this is a great post, Erin. It's nice to see someone actually acknowledging that police officers are not the bad guys and that they need more training to help them do their job safely and effectively. In your post, you said that police officers should be trained in the use of a gun. I would like to point out that all police officers"
Human,cmv-153,"With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more repercussions to an officer that kills a citizen. The benefits to having a process like this includes: 1. No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would. I mean, what if an officer showed up to the scene of a shooting (in which the shooter called 911 for help) and the shooter was there with the weapon and openly admitted to killing the victim in self-defense (which upon observation it was blatantly obvious it wad self-defense)? Surely the officer would draw his her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with ""hey are you okay?"" and ""Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave."" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person. 2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings. 3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that ""justifies"" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder. Even if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in. Just apply the same situation to 2 citizens, surely the one who lives would be charged with murder and only the results of an investigation would set them free. I'm just frustrated with all the bull shit I hear about cops and would like to hear the logic of the other side because I feel I'm blinded from it. So CMV. Edit: Okay, too many people are correcting me on minor technicalities which isn't helping. You cannot deny that there is an obvious bias when it comes to determining if an officer killing someone is justified or not, at least compared to a citizen killing another citizen. I just believe that bias should not exist."

If they don't train them properly then it could lead down this path where instead he was trying his best not get shot by some angry off duty cop who had drank too heavily after work picked up their weapon (or even worse; maybe like me just being careless with my gun). No one wants innocent person's lives lost over something as trivial!

For some reason, when it comes to police brutality or shootings by cops I always think about my parents who were raised in an era where government was not involved in many aspects of life including education, health care, housing etc.. They had no idea what went into being part of America's so-called ""free society."" I am all for having access to guns but at the same time I'm also concerned when they are used unnecessarily like most gun owners do today...to protect their own personal property rather than protecting others from violence. Of course, if you can afford one (the Smith Wesson.357 magnum) then just carry it around wherever you go because it's easy to conceal... The big question is why do thugs want guns? Thuggery has become so prevalent right now and even citizens have been attacked - how much easier would someone consider carrying a weapon? This video shows two white women confronting a black man at a bus stop after he allegedly grabbed another woman while she tried to get off the bus: What goes through your mind before you walk outside the house armed? Is it fear of getting shot or handcuffed? What does freedom mean to you? Do these actions make sense given our current situation in terms of freedom and human rights?"
Human,cmv-154,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. So Air Canada can fly a plane from Toronto to New York, but can't continue that plane on to Miami. I think this rule is dumb and protectionist. [Airline safety and protocols are subject to international treaties already,] and if we wanted, foreign airlines could be subjected to additional FAA safety checks as a condition of being allowed to engage in cabotage. With the current state of the US airline industry being [so close-knit as to promote collusion,] a healthy dose of competition seems like it's in order. Opening up cabotage would allow a lot more competition in US aviation, which would be a big benefit to consumers as far as price. It would also likely allow a lot of airports which aren't presently hubs to get better overseas service. For instance, British Airways might not be able to justify a direct flight from Cleveland or St Louis to London, but it might be able to justify a flight that does St Louis - Cleveland - London.

Tsinghua,cmv-154,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. But if you are headquartered in the US, you can. Airlines have lobbied for this, because they believe it's unfair to charge the same price for a ticket from Los Angeles to New York as a ticket from New York to Los Angeles. This is how the airlines make money. When you fly, you are paying for the right to use the infrastructure of the airline. The price you pay for a ticket is not just for the airline to fly you, but also for the airports to keep their runways open, the roads to get you to the airport, the bridges to get you to the airport, the airlines to keep their infrastructure open, and the airports to keep their runways open. The airports would close down if there weren't people willing to pay the tolls to use their infrastructure. If you're willing to pay, you can use it. If you don't, you can't. If you're flying from Chicago to Los Angeles, the airline's infrastructure is a runway in Los Angeles. If you're flying from New York to Los Angeles, the airline's infrastructure is a runway in New York. The airlines have to charge the same price for the same service because the airports and the roads are using the same infrastructure. But that doesn't mean you have to pay the same price for the same service. It's unfair to charge the same price for a ticket from Los Angeles to New York as a ticket from New York to Los Angeles. In the United States, you have a choice of carriers. You can fly Delta, United, American, Southwest, JetBlue, Frontier, or United Express. If you want to fly United, you have to buy a ticket from United Airlines. If you want to fly Delta, you have to buy a ticket from Delta Airlines. But if you want to fly Southwest, you have to buy a ticket from Southwest Airlines. The way it works now is that airlines don't want to lose money. If you're flying from Los Angeles to New York, the airline is losing money on the first leg, so the airline wants to get you from New York to Los Angeles. If you're flying from New York to Los Angeles, the airline is losing money on the second leg, so the airline wants to get you from Los Angeles to New York. If you're flying from Los Angeles to New York, the airline is losing money on both legs, so the airline wants to get you from New York to Los Angeles. If you're flying from New York to Los Angeles, the airline is losing money on both legs, so the airline wants to get you from Los Angeles to New York. If you're flying from Los Angeles to New York, the airline is losing money on both legs, so the airline wants to get you from New York to Los Angeles. If you're flying from New York to Los Angeles, the airline is losing money on both legs, so the airline wants to get you from Los Angeles to New York. This is how the airlines make money. The airline is losing money on the first leg, so it wants to get you to the next leg. The airline is losing money on the second leg, so it wants to get you to the next leg. The airline is losing money on the third leg, so it wants to get you to the next leg. The airline is losing money on the fourth leg, so it wants to get you to the next leg. The airline is losing money on the fifth leg, so it wants to get you to the next leg. The airline is losing money on the sixth leg, so it wants to get you to the next leg.

OpenAI,cmv-154,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. That is correct. The regulatory framework in the United States does not allow foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. This is known as the cabotage rule. The rule is in place to protect the domestic airlines, their workforce, and the national security interests of the United States. However, some experts argue that rethinking the cabotage rule could lead to increased competition, lower prices for consumers, and could benefit the airline industry as a whole."
LLAMA,cmv-154,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was intended to open up the American airline industry to competition. Part of that act forbid the FAA from regulating cabotage. As a result of this, American carriers have been forced to compete with each other, while foreign carriers have been allowed to operate between major US cities. This is not a level playing field. It's time to level the playing field, open up airline competition, and allow all airlines to compete on routes between US cities. The American people deserve lower fares and better service.

PaLM,cmv-154,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. But legislation introduced in Congress would change that, opening up the market to more competition and potentially lower fares. The bill, called the Open Skies Cabotage Act, was introduced by Reps. John Katko (R-N.Y.) and Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) in March. It would allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights within the United States, provided they meet certain requirements, such as having a U.S. operating certificate and providing service to at least one U.S. city that is not currently served by a U.S. airline. Supporters of the bill say it would boost competition in the U.S. airline market, which is dominated by a few large carriers. They argue that foreign airlines would be able to offer lower fares and better service than U.S. airlines, which would benefit consumers. Opponents of the bill say it would put U.S. airlines at a disadvantage and could lead to job losses. They argue that foreign airlines would be able to undercut U.S. airlines on fares, forcing the U.S. airlines to either match the lower fares or lose customers. This would lead to losses for U.S. airlines and could result in job losses. The bill is still in the early stages of the legislative process and it is not clear if it will become law. However, it is a sign that there is growing interest in opening up the U.S. airline market to more competition. There are a number of potential benefits to allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic flights in the United States.  Increased competition: Foreign airlines would be able to offer lower fares and better service than U.S. airlines, which would benefit consumers.  New routes: Foreign airlines could offer new routes to destinations that are not currently served by U.S. airlines. This would give consumers more options and could help to boost tourism.  Job creation: Foreign airlines could create jobs in the United States by hiring U.S. workers and investing in U.S. infrastructure. However, there are also a number of potential risks to allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic flights in the United States.  Loss of jobs: U.S. airlines could lose market share to foreign airlines, which could lead to job losses.  Decline in service quality: Foreign airlines may not be as committed to providing high-quality service as U.S. airlines. This could lead to a decline in service quality for U.S. consumers.  Increased risk of accidents: Foreign airlines may not have the same safety standards as U.S. airlines. This could increase the risk of accidents. The decision of whether or not to allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights in the United States is a complex one. There are a number of factors to consider, including the potential benefits and risks. Ultimately, the decision will need to be made based on what is best for the U.S. economy and consumers."

Cabo clearly demonstrates that this needn't be so - indeed it's a good thing for American consumers who want lower prices and more competition on transcontinental flights (it costs less than 1M per route made illegal). It would also help Mexico by enhancing its international image as an aviation powerhouse with low-cost service from New York JFK via DallasFort Worth or Phoenix [Dallas] through Guadalajara into South America...

Lindsey Graham's campaign. (Graham eventually lost.) Let's face it; anytime we go into the polling place to cast our ballot on election day there will probably be hundreds if not thousands of people just like us going through what feels like the same process: asking ourselves why we're doing this in the first place, whether voting even matters anymore, how much we really care about what's happening right now...

Many are unable to work or interact socially, and are constantly asking for help, attention, and to be told that they are worth something. They have no meaningful relationships and are very unstable. My question is: what do you do with people like that? I know this is a very unpopular idea to some people, but it seems to me that these people could benefit from euthanasia. I know that people will say that everyone has the right to live, and that life is precious, and all of that. But to me it seems that these people have absolutely no quality of life, and that they are nothing but a burden. I'm not trying to be mean, or anything like that. I just feel that we as a society should try to help these people as much as we can. I do know that there are people who will say that euthanasia should not be allowed under any circumstances. I guess that I am an outcast in that respect. I know that I will never be able to work and function like a normal person, but I don't have any interest in living. I don't see any point to living. I have never felt that I was worth anything, and I am always asking for attention and trying to be close to people who don't care about me at all. I am very unstable.

I am not trying to be negative. I am just trying to be realistic. I know that I am a burden to everyone, and I would rather just not be here. I know that there are people who will say that there are people who have schizophrenia or bipolar who are able to function, and that is certainly true.

Asymptomatic Covid-19 patients recovered faster from illness and were unable to transmit virus during their recovery period, according to research published online by Scientific Reports. The study was led by researchers at Rutgers University Medical Center, Newark NJ, and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX, which examined data collected between April 5 and June 7 2020 from 1309 asymptomatically infected persons in Wuhan China. Using saliva samples obtained from participants before they began receiving treatment, their viral loads, antibody titers, immune responses and genetic information were analyzed. ""The results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes beneficial effects in both the innate and adaptive immunity systems [of healthy volunteers] but these benefits diminish over time after the initial phase of the disease course,"" said senior author Jianguo Deng, PhD, professor emeritus in infectious diseases and immunology at UTSWUTMB School of Medicine, and director of UTSW's Center for Infectious Diseases Research Education. ""This observation coincides well with recent retrospective studies showing that the majority of symptomatic COVID-19 cases develop mild symptoms while only a minority remain severely ill, especially those aged under 60 years old. ""A concern remains regarding those not developing severe symptoms despite having high viral load andor detectable antibodies, and may represent possible reservoirs of coronaviruses present among otherwise healthy populations. This finding suggests that such ""asymptomatic carriers"" should also be considered targets for vaccination efforts."" In total 181 subjects tested positive for IgM in plasma taken soon after symptom onset; 13 weeks later most had no residual IgM presence indicating clearance of the virus. Another 91 experienced reappearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels suggesting reactivation of preexisting B cells producing specific neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. Surprisingly, seven out of nine seronegative patients re-expressed low level of antibodies that continued 4 months post-infection."

I think that it might be more humane to euthanize them than to keep them alive in a state of limbo. They're not living, and they're not really dying. They're just existing. I know that some people would say that it's wrong to kill people, even if they're suffering. But I think that there's a point where suffering becomes too much, and it's better to just end it. I'm not saying that we should euthanize all people with mental illness. But I think that we should at least consider it for those who are in a lot of pain and who have no hope of getting better. I know that this is a difficult topic, but I think it's important to talk about. We need to find a way to help people who are suffering, and we need to make sure that they're not just forgotten about. Thank you for listening."

For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, create art and music, etc... I recently discovered that the premise behind Hitler's T4 program is that anyone with a seemingly incurable illness that severely hinders their abilities should be euthanized. It sounds kind of awful at first, but these people absorb so much of society's resources. Think of how much better off we would be economically without them. I have a brother who is low-functioning autistic and his whole life he's cost our family so much money just so that we don't have to constantly watch over him.

A ""moderate"" Islamist is someone who is not an Islamist, but is not necessarily against the idea of an Islamic state. These people often argue that they are more tolerant and humane than Islamists, and they should be accepted and not discriminated against. What they fail to realize is that this is an ideology that wants to establish an Islamic state, and they are working to do so by using the tools of Islam. So, if you're reading this and you're a ""moderate"" Islamist, I hope you're aware of what you are. I'm also going to suggest that you consider this article to be ""radical,"" because you are too.

Islamist - People who advocate Islamism Islam - A religion, based on the Koran, that Muslims believe to be the word of God, sent to Muhammad over time through the angel Gabriel. Muslim - Someone who follows the religion of Islam, believing there is only one God, and that Muhammad is his prophet. 2 The Different Types of Islamism 3 The Different Types of Islamism Islamism - A term used to describe the political ideology which holds that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life. The Different Types of Islamism. Modernist Islamism - Is a movement that has attempted to reconcile the Islamic faith with the modern world. It is one of the three major divisions of Islamism, along with Traditionalism and Fundamentalism. Fundamentalist Islamism - The most conservative and reactionary of the three main branches of Islamism. It is a literalist approach to the Quran, Sunnah and Hadith. It is to be distinguished from the use of the term fundamentalist in other religions, and is similar to the use of the term Salafi, or Salafist. Traditionalist Islamism - The traditionalist school of Islamism, is also referred to as the Madhkali school. It is a movement of Muslims who reject the Islamist ideology and advocate the rejection of political Islamism. They believe that Islam is compatible with secular government. 4 Wahhabism Wahhabism is a fundamentalist, ultraconservative branch of Sunni Islam. Wahhabism is often described as being ""austere,"" ""puritanical,"" ""extremist,"" or ""fanatical."" It is a branch of Islam which calls for the ""return"" of the Muslim world to a stricter observance of the original tenets of Islam as they were practiced and lived by Muhammad and his earliest followers, known as the Salaf. Wahhabism is named after the Arabian reformer and theologian, Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab , whose original ideas were elaborated and systematized by successive generations of Muslim leaders, thinkers, and writers, particularly along the Arabian Peninsula and within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The origins of Wahhabism lie in the doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya and the school of thought he inspired, which are often referred to as a pure form of Islam. From the 1740s, Wahhabi ideas spread rapidly in the Arabian Peninsula and the Nejd region. In the 20th century, it was adopted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose expansion in size through conquest in the 1920s corresponded with the spread of Wahhabism. 5 Wahhabism Wahhabism is sometimes referred to as a sect, but most Muslims consider it to be a part of mainstream Sunni Islam. It is often considered the most rigid and inflexible of the Sunni schools of Islam. Wahhabism has been accused of being a source of global terrorism, inspiring the ideology of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and for causing disunity in Muslim communities by labelling Muslims who disagreed with the Wahhabi definition of monotheism as apostates (takfir) and justifying their killing. 6 Pan-Islamism The term ""Pan-Islamism"" is generally used to describe the political movement to unify all Muslims under a single Islamic"

Islam - Religion with 1 billion followers worldwide. Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh. Sheik - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinionsrulings, known as fatwas. My case is this. Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK. The emergence of ISISISILDaesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country. A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance. Islam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this. A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers. My solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. TL;DR - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World. It answers a lot of the current political problems in Muslim countries and would help establish Islam as the progressive force I believe it has always been, rather than the regressive and conservative force people fear it to be.

Islam ism can be seen as a form of political Islam that seeks to establish Islamic law in the state and society, often through the use of force or coercion. Salafism - A puritanical Sunni Islamic movement that advocates for a return to the original practices and beliefs of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Salafis reject all innovations, interpretations, and religious practices developed after the era of the companions. Some Salafis believe in the use of force to purify Islam from what they perceive as un-Islamic practices and beliefs. Jihad - A term that means ""struggle"" or ""striving"" in Arabic. It has several meanings in Islamic tradition, including the internal struggle to purify oneself and the external struggle to defend the faith against its enemies. Some extremist groups interpret jihad as a holy war against non-Muslims, using it to justify acts of terrorism. Sharia - The Islamic law or legal system based on the Quran, the Hadith, and other Islamic sources. Sharia covers a wide range of topics, including worship, marriage, inheritance, criminal law, and economics. Some Islamist movements seek to establish Sharia as the sole legal system in the state and society. Caliphate - An Islamic form of government in which the political and religious leadership is unified under a single individual, known as the caliph. The caliphate existed in various forms throughout Islamic history and was abolished by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1924, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Some Islamist movements seek to re-establish the caliphate as a means of restoring Muslim unity and power."
PaLM,cmv-158,"Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that humans would hold more positions than other species, given that they were the founding species of the Federation. However, the disparity is far greater than can be explained by this alone. There are a number of factors that contribute to the overrepresentation of humans in the Federation. First, humans are a naturally ambitious and competitive species. They are driven to succeed and achieve, and they are not afraid to take risks. This drive has led them to occupy a disproportionate number of leadership positions in the Federation. Second, humans are a technologically advanced species. They have a long history of innovation and discovery, and they are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. This technological prowess has given them a significant advantage over other species, and it has allowed them to achieve a level of dominance that is unmatched by any other species in the Federation. Third, humans are a persuasive and diplomatic species. They are skilled at building relationships and forming alliances. This has allowed them to build a strong network of allies within the Federation, and it has given them a significant advantage in terms of political power. Finally, humans are a resilient and adaptable species. They are able to withstand hardship and adversity, and they are able to adapt to new challenges. This resilience has allowed them to survive and thrive in a variety of harsh environments, and it has given them a significant advantage over other species in the Federation. The overrepresentation of humans in the Federation is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is important to be aware of the factors that contribute to this disparity in order to address them and create a more equitable and inclusive Federation. Here are some specific examples of how humans have been overrepresented in the Federation:  In the United Federation of Planets, humans hold the majority of positions in the Starfleet Command, including the position of Starfleet Admiral.  In the United Earth Government, humans hold the majority of positions in the government, including the position of President of the United Earth Government.  In the United Nations of Planets, humans hold the majority of positions in the General Assembly, including the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations of Planets. The overrepresentation of humans in these positions of power has led to a number of problems, including:  The marginalization of non-human species in the Federation.  The perpetuation of human-centric values and perspectives in the Federation.  The exploitation of non-human resources by humans. In order to address these problems, it is important to increase the representation of non-human species in positions of power in the Federation. This can be done by:  Increasing the number of non-human Starfleet officers.  Increasing the number of non-human members of the United Earth Government.  Increasing the number of non-human representatives in the United Nations of Planets. By increasing the representation of non-human species in positions of power in the Federation, we can help to create a more equitable and inclusive Federation for all."
LLAMA,cmv-158,"Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that in TOS and TNG that there would be some bias to humans because the show takes place in a human-centric universe. But DS9, VOY and ENT all featured aliens as lead characters, and all three shows had a human as the commander. In TOS and TNG, the shows and movies are set in a universe that's heavily populated by humans, so the idea that humans would be the majority of the Federation's population is reasonable. After all, humanity was the first race to discover warp drive, and as we see in TOS, it was humans who were most interested in expanding beyond our own star system. In DS9, there are numerous alien races populating the station, but it's run by a human. In VOY, the ship is filled with a bunch of aliens, yet there's a human in command. Even in ENT, which takes place when humanity is still getting its feet wet, humanity plays an outsized role. It's not a huge problem, and it's one of those things that you don't really notice when watching the show. But when you start thinking about it, it seems rather unrealistic. Why would all these alien races let humans lead them? I think I'm going to go with the fact that, up until the late 24th century, Earth was the only Federation planet. The Federation was more of a Federation of Nations, like the U.N., in the early days. As the Federation expanded, it started taking on more characteristics of a unified planet. As for why humanity ended up in so many high positions, I think it's simply because there are a lot of humans in the Federation. It might not have been the intention of the Federation's founders to be human-centric, but it just worked out that way. After all, there are a lot of humans in the Federation, especially in the 24th century. I can only think of one instance of a non-human in a high-ranking Federation position. That would be the Federation President in VOY. But maybe we'll see more of that in ST:Picard. Yes, it's always been a bit of a discrepancy. They've always been aware of it, though. TNG ""The Outcast"" had a gender-non-binary alien society that was generally more advanced than the Federation, and they had a human ambassador. They even discuss the discrepancy in the episode, with Riker explaining that he got the position because there's a shortage of qualified candidates. The same episode has a human admiral (Admiral Nechayev). I think the discrepancy is more likely to be addressed with Discovery, where they've shown a far more diverse cast of characters (and they've already begun to address it by having Saru be a higher-ranking officer than Lorca). While I agree that it is an odd thing to note, I also think that there are several reasons for it. The first being that the show, as you mentioned, is human centric. The vast majority of the show's main characters are human, and so there are only a limited number of non-human characters to choose from, and so it makes sense that these high ranking Federation officials are all going to be human. Another reason I can think of is that the Federation is built from the ground up by humans, and so it is logical to assume that humans are going to have the most influence in how the Federation operates, and how the Starfleet command structure works. We also need to remember that in the 24th century, as well as later, Earth was still the center of Starfleet and Federation operations. I think it could have been better explained as more of an issue of qualifications and resources, rather than some sort of bias or ""breadbasket"" issue. Yeah, I think that's the biggest issue. ST:Picard seems to have made a point of focusing more on non-humans in the Federation, so it will be interesting to see how it addresses this. To add to this, the Federation is also highly centralized. We see in TNG that the Federation Council has been discussing issues like reinstating the death penalty. So, there's a very real possibility that the Federation Council is also human-centric. That's a good point. It's not that humans"

Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that humans play a significant role in the Federation, as they were one of the founding members and have a long history of exploration and diplomacy. However, it is important to note that the Federation values diversity and equal representation, and non-human species hold important roles as well. It is also important to recognize that humans may have different skills and abilities that are valued in leadership positions. Ultimately, the Federation strives to operate on a merit-based system where individuals are recognized for their abilities, rather than their species."
Human,cmv-158,"Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable for the organization to be based out of San Francisco, where the 4 founding races formed the coalition of planets, but with 150 member planets spread over 8,000 light years, why is so much of the leadership human? This isn't a superficial skin-color thing, we're dealing with marked biological differences between the races. Vulcans, despite their violent past, have achieved ""superhuman"" levels of mastery over their emotions, allowing them to become excellent administrators and politicians, and even if we were to assume that Humans and Vulcans have the same fundamental capacity for intelligence, Vulcan discipline gives them supreme focus to produce an inordinate concentration of highly educated citizens. Even in sheer physical prowess, Vulcans massively outclass Humans, ""Take me out to the Holosuite"" being an excellent example: Here, the Vulcans are shown to be physically far superior, DOMINATING the mixed-race (human dominant) crew fielded by the Human Captain, in a human sport, with a final score of 10-1. Nevertheless the crew of DS9 celebrate their single point as a victory of human will rather than learning from the experience that Vulcans are superior in so many ways. Vulcans are known for logic, they take great efforts to avoid letting their emotions cloud their judgement. We all know of a prestigious Human starship captain for ignoring the odds in a situation and taking great risks over the protests of his even-keeled Vulcan officer. It's convenient that luck favored the crew so often after these brash and illogical decisions. These apparent ""successes"" for making the wrong decision only served to stroke this captain's ego and belief that his ""gut instincts"" are what qualify him to lead. How is this different from a foolish business executive making random decisions and claiming credit for successes, and blaming other factors for failures? The meritorious act is in the decision itself, not in the outcome. To judge the brash decision based on a fortunate outcome is a flawed post hoc reasoning, akin to throwing a dart, sliding a dartboard under it, and claiming an excellent throw! What if even a few of those risks resulted in the likely outcome where many if not all of the crew members were killed because the captain ignored the logical choice in favor of an unsupported gut decision? If there are any flaws to be noted in the Vulcan people as a whole, it would be low birth-rates, a bias towards peace, and a relative lack of ego (despite whatever projections humans perceive in a Vulcan's taciturn face). Perhaps humans have seized so much power as a direct result of greed, ambition, and nepotism, allowing them to promote humans above more qualified non-human members of Starfleet? Nevertheless, it seems clear that Vulcans are superior to humans. (The tone's intentionally a bit tongue and cheek to make this discussion more fun, but the fiction really does seem to over-exalt humans in the Federation)"

But in the television series, the sheer number of humans on high positions, particularly at Starfleet Command, is staggering. There's no shortage of officers who share that attribute.

First of all, humans are the dominant species in the Federation. There's no shortage of humanoids in the films. But in the television series, the sheer number of humans on high positions, particularly at Starfleet Command, is staggering. This fact was established early on in Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the first season, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, the starship Enterprise's chief engineer, is assigned to the ship's bridge as its chief of engineering. His counterpart on the bridge is also a human, Commander Data. The two of them, along with several other humans, comprise the majority of the bridge crew. Of course, that's only a small portion of the ship's personnel. There are plenty of other humans, like Captain Picard and First Officer Riker, who command the starship. The sheer number of humans on the Enterprise makes it a bit more obvious that they are the dominant species. Even in the second season, La Forge is given the nickname ""Mr. Spock,"" since the starship's first officer is a Vulcan. La Forge and Data are the only two humans on the bridge. The fact that there are so many humans on the bridge also means that there are more humans at Starfleet Command. The Starfleet Command has a majority of humans as well. Even if you're not familiar with the Star Trek canon, you can't miss the fact that there are so many humans at the top.

Human,cmv-159,"Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as they start earning, ect. ect. I'm an economics undergrad so I have a little (it is only a little) understanding of savings, but I believe that a drastic increase in savings would be a catastrophe for a few reasons: 1) Intrest rates. The current interest is LOW, if not negative in real terms. This means that there arn't sufficient (safe) borrowers to allocate the funds to. Increasing the savings more risks entering a liquidity trap. 2) Stagnation of demand. If you encourage people to save then they arn't spending (obviously). This is probably the worst thing that could happen right now (or in the next few years). 3) Asset price bubbles. With lots of savings being depositied banks will be forced to'do' something with that money. Some of the things they will do is buy assets, or lend to buyers of assets: such as Bonds, stocks, property. ect. Rapid increases in the purchase of these has historically lead to their prices becoming speculative. It also prices out of the market the very people who you are teaching should save: Young people. So thats why I think encouraging, on mass, a new generation of young people to start savings to that degree would end badly. I want to understand why others think it shoudl be encouraged so I'm posting here."
LLAMA,cmv-159,"Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as they start work, etc. Anyway, it got me thinking. The more I read, the more I feel like the concept of money is not an easy one for children to grasp. I don't know if any of you have had this experience, but I have an almost 2 year old (will be 2 in October) and we have had to take her to AE twice in the past 12 months. The first time was when she fell and her teeth went through her bottom lip (ouch!), and the second time was when she stuck a pin in her eye (double ouch!!). Both times, she has had to have an anaesthetic before the procedure could be done. The first time she was asleep within 2 seconds of the nurse injecting the anaesthetic into her hand. The second time, she was very upset and crying. The nurse tried to inject the anaesthetic and it just didn't work. The needle went in, but the anaesthetic didn't go in. She tried 3 times before giving up and getting a doctor to try. The doctor tried a different vein, and again, the needle went in but nothing came out. After 3 failed attempts, they had to give up and try a different method. During this whole process, my daughter was very upset and crying. I was getting very upset and angry as well, because I hated seeing her so upset, and I was getting anxious about how she would be able to get the procedure done without anaesthetic, as she was obviously terrified and the procedure would be too painful for her. As soon as the doctor gave up, I started demanding a different method. The nurse suggested another method - numbing the eye with eye drops, putting a patch over it, and then injecting the anaesthetic into the cheek. I said yes to this immediately, and they took my daughter away to get it done. While they were gone, I was getting very angry. I was very angry that I was in a hospital in a first world country, and the equipment that they were using wasn't working. I was angry that the nurse was trying to tell me how to calm my daughter down, when I already knew everything she was saying. I was angry that she didn't seem to understand why my daughter was so upset, and that she was just blaming it on my daughter's crying. I was also angry that the doctor couldn't get the anaesthetic to work, as it was clearly a lack of skill. After a few minutes, the nurse came and told me that my daughter was asleep, and I could come and see her. I went over to the bed, and I sat down beside my daughter. The nurse said that she was very brave, and asked if I wanted to give her a cuddle. I said no, because she was asleep. The nurse then said that she was only asleep from the eye drops, and that she would wake up soon. I said no, she was asleep because she was given the anaesthetic. The nurse said no, they didn't give her the anaesthetic because she was crying too much. I said yes, they gave her the anaesthetic because they used a different method. She insisted that they didn't give her the anaesthetic. I got really angry then and said that they did give her the anaesthetic, because she is asleep. Then the doctor came over and said that they didn't give her the anaesthetic. I said that they did, because she is asleep. The doctor then said that they didn't give her the anaesthetic, they gave her paracetamol and ibuprofen. I said yes, they did give her those drugs, but they also gave her the anaesthetic, because she is asleep. The doctor insisted that they didn't give her the anaesthetic, they just gave her paracetamol and ibuprofen. I insisted that they did give her the anaesthetic, because she is asleep. After a while, the doctor left, and I was still sitting next to my daughter, who was still asleep. The nurse tried to take her pulse and blood pressure"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-159,"Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible. Interesting concept (and not totally new), but can it work? I'm thinking about this from an investment perspective: Can you take care for your family if one day they decide that ""enough is enough"" and leave home forever or retire early - after having put away 15-20 percent into their own pensions over decades?. It seems doubtful... But what do financial experts think on here? Is there any history backing up these kind ideas"

I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible, and investing in low-cost index funds for long-term growth.

Tsinghua,cmv-159,"Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible, and I got thinking about this. Now I'm 25, and have been saving since I was 16. I was pretty bad at it until recently, and got to a point where I could just contribute my minimum every month and it was enough to pay for my entire mortgage, which is 15 years old. My income is not a lot, and I live on a pretty tight budget, but I have enough savings to pay for all of my monthly bills (apart from a little bit of debt I'm trying to pay off) and I have enough to pay for a modest vacation in a couple of years time. I'm pretty happy with where I am, but there's always room for improvement. My goal is to have enough savings to pay for my house and all of my monthly bills, and enough to travel comfortably. I want to have enough savings to be able to take a nice vacation to somewhere nice every year or two. My question is this: What are the best ways to save money and build up savings? Should I save every dollar I get? I feel like I could be doing more, but I'm afraid that I will start to become complacent and not save enough. Also, should I be contributing to my retirement plan at work? If so, how much should I be contributing? I'm not sure if I'm qualified for an employer match, and I'm not sure how much my company would match. Should I be doing more? Any tips are appreciated! EDIT: I forgot to mention, I'm in the UK. A: I would say save every penny you can. Save for your vacations and your holidays, but save every penny you can. Then, when you have enough saved, invest the extra. I think that this is what is recommended by many in the investment industry. When you have saved enough to be comfortable with a large sum of money, you can invest it in stocks and bonds, which will hopefully give you a good return on your money. A: It is definitely important to start early, but I don't think it is worth stressing out over. It is important to start early and it is important to continue saving. However, if you do have a large enough sum of money, it would be a good idea to invest it in stocks and bonds."
PaLM,cmv-159,"Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importance of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible. I wholeheartedly agree with this, and I think it's a shame that it's not something that's taught more widely. Personal finance is an essential life skill, and it's something that everyone should have a good understanding of. It's not just about saving for retirement, it's also about managing your day-to-day finances, making informed decisions about your money, and building good financial habits. If you're not taught about personal finance at school, then you're likely to learn about it the hard way - through making mistakes and costly financial decisions. This can have a negative impact on your financial wellbeing for years to come. So, what can we do to make sure that more people are taught about personal finance? Here are a few ideas:  Start teaching personal finance in schools at a young age. The earlier you start learning about personal finance, the better. This will give you time to develop good financial habits and make informed decisions about your money.  Make personal finance a compulsory subject in schools. It's important that everyone has a basic understanding of personal finance, regardless of their future career path. Making personal finance a compulsory subject would ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn about it.  Provide more financial education resources for adults. There are a number of resources available to help adults learn about personal finance, but they can be difficult to find. We need to make these resources more accessible so that more people can benefit from them.  Encourage people to talk about personal finance. It's often difficult to talk about money, but it's important to do so. Talking about personal finance can help us to learn from each other's experiences and make better financial decisions. Personal finance is an important life skill, and we need to do everything we can to make sure that more people are taught about it. By following these suggestions, we can help to improve the financial wellbeing of people all over the world."

But I also think it's a bit unfair that the onus is always on them. I mean, what if I want to do something for my kids on Father's Day? What if I want to take them out to dinner or buy them a present? Can't I do that? Or is that not allowed? I don't know. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive.

I know there are a number of people who do appreciate their fathers. I do appreciate my father, and I realize some people have really good relationships with their fathers. I think that is great, and I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father. I think that is how it should be. I do not begrudge anyone who is close to their father or who appreciates them. However, I do not appreciate the pressure of Father's Day. It seems to me that, with every ""holiday,"" we are being told that we have to spend money to prove that we care. If we don't buy our father a gift, we aren't a good sondaughter. If we don't buy our husband a gift, we aren't a good wife. It's all about the money. We are supposed to go out and buy something. I don't like that. I don't like feeling like I'm supposed to go buy something for my father, when the only reason I am buying anything is because it is Father's Day. I don't like feeling like my wife is supposed to buy me something, just because it is Father's Day. I would much rather have a genuine gift, or just a handmade card, than some overpriced piece of junk that was bought only because it was Father's Day. It has occurred to me that the only people who are celebrating this day are the retailers. They are the only ones who really have anything to gain from this holiday. I know this may sound like sour grapes, and maybe it is. I can't help but wonder why we don't have Mother's Day and Father's Day on the same day. We could even have a ""Parents' Day."" It would probably be a lot cheaper for everyone. I don't know if I will ever like Father's Day. At least I am not alone in my disdain for this holiday."

Perhaps instead of focusing on the traditional celebrations associated with Father's Day, you could take the opportunity to reflect on your relationship with your children and think of ways to deepen it. You could spend the day doing something fun with your family, or you could sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation with your kids about anything that might be on their minds.

PaLM,cmv-161,"There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of an academic degree, but has now been extended to mark a wide range of achievements, from completing a course of study to joining an organisation. The custom has become popular in schools as a way to celebrate the achievements of their pupils and to mark the transition from one stage of education to another. There are a number of reasons why schools are holding graduation ceremonies for younger children. One reason is that they want to create a sense of achievement and accomplishment for their pupils. For children who may not have achieved academic success, a graduation ceremony can provide them with a positive experience and help them to feel good about themselves. It can also help to motivate them to continue their education and achieve their full potential. Another reason why schools are holding graduation ceremonies is that they want to create a sense of community and belonging. A graduation ceremony can be a way for children to celebrate their achievements with their friends and teachers. It can also help to foster a sense of pride in the school and its pupils. Finally, schools are holding graduation ceremonies because they believe that they are a good way to mark the transition from one stage of education to another. A graduation ceremony can help children to feel like they are moving on to a new and exciting chapter in their lives. It can also help them to make the transition from primary school to secondary school or from secondary school to college or university. There are some concerns about the trend of holding graduation ceremonies for younger children. Some people believe that it is inappropriate to give children the same level of recognition as adults who have completed a degree. They also worry that graduation ceremonies can create a sense of entitlement and that children will come to expect to be rewarded for every achievement. However, the majority of people believe that graduation ceremonies for younger children are a positive thing. They believe that they can help to boost children's self-esteem, create a sense of community and belonging, and mark the transition from one stage of education to another. If you are considering holding a graduation ceremony for your school, there are a few things you need to consider. First, you need to decide what the purpose of the ceremony is. Do you want to celebrate the achievements of your pupils? Do you want to create a sense of community and belonging? Or do you want to mark the transition from one stage of education to another? Once you have decided on the purpose of the ceremony, you need to decide who will be invited. Will you invite all of the pupils in the school? Will you only invite those who have achieved a certain level of success? Or will you invite a select group of pupils? You also need to decide what the ceremony will involve. Will there be speeches? Will there be music? Will there be a procession? Finally, you need to decide how much the ceremony will cost. Will you need to hire a venue? Will you need to pay for food and drinks? Will you need to hire entertainment? If you are unsure about any of these decisions, it is a good idea to talk to other schools that have held graduation ceremonies. You can also get advice from your local education authority. Holding a graduation ceremony for younger children can be a positive experience for both the pupils and the school. However, it is important to make sure that the ceremony is appropriate for the age of the pupils and that it is well-planned."
Human,cmv-161,"There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education). I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a'graduation' stands for. There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions To give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same. My son is supposed to have a'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place.

A graduation was originally to signify the conferring , or attaining a degree. Graduations often take place at universities but increasingly they are being held outside formal education settings with graduates receiving their degrees from parentsteachers rather than academic institutions.[1] However there has been considerable controversy surrounding this practice,[23]. The most recent example came when Chloe Madeley's brother Christopher graduated as 'Doctor Harris-Jones', which drew accusations that she had exploited her son[4], although both parties denied any malpractice on either side [5].[6],[7] (See also:"
BigScience,cmv-161,"There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring upon a pupil the right to sit at certain fixed places on the table, but it has now become more commonplace as a ceremony celebrating achievement or passing through the grades. It can be seen that such celebrations are becoming increasingly popular with parents using them within their own private spheres. Theoretical Framework This article draws together research undertaken by the author in order to: identify key areas of concern relating to school transitions; establish whether there were any similarities between children's experiences when moving from one type of education setting to another; and explore how mothers perceived this transition taking place in order to identify issues which could have significance for those managing school-related events for young people who had been previously educated outside traditional childrens' settings such as nursery schools or infant schools. In order to analyse these data, two theoretical lenses referred to below will provide a basis for understanding the findings. Intellectual Development Theory One way of dealing with developmental challenges faced during early childhood would be to view them purely as emergent problems and then develop strategies around addressing them as they arise within existing structures and approaches. This approach assumes that whatever difficulties emerge relate solely to individual developments rather than social factors having played some part in producing them. However, considerable evidence suggests that not only do disparities remain between groups based on gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status even though children initially grow up under the same conditions, but also that even if all children started off life under identical circumstances inequalities still persist over time resulting in different outcomes [e.g., Fagan et al. (1998) ]. Such inequality may therefore derive either from interactions occurring between individuals themselves andor external influences beyond their control. The failure to acknowledge this reality might lead teachers operating within mainstream primary contexts to dismiss particular behavioural patterns associated with socially disadvantaged families as being due simply to poor parenting style rather than reflecting underlying structural injustices related to prejudice against minority ethnic communities. From the perspective adopted here however, intellectual development in relation to learning does not necessarily depend entirely on cognitive skills acquired from formal educational programmes but may reflect other changes in brain functioning brought about by such activities as reading comprehension, writing ability etc. In line with Piaget's theory of 'intelligence', knowledge and skill needed to complete tasks required to successfully navigate one's environment differ according to age because each person develops differently along separate routes following unique biological pathways where earlier stages need to be completed before later ones can take hold [Shaw Corbett-McFadyen (2000), cit Rothbart]. For example, although most adults possess sufficient intelligence to learn basic numeracy concepts (i.e. counting), they generally struggle strongly when trying to understand abstract mathematical definitions involving relationships between quantities of money or proportionate measurement causing delays in developing the capacity to use maths effectively in everyday situations [Bongert (2005) ]. As well as considering physical abilities alone, ways must furthermore be found to help children acquire new skill sets including verbal reasoning and problem-solving styles appropriate to each phase so they progressively build on what they've already achieved whilst developing new capabilities which meet future demands. If we accept that the pre-school years represent a critical period in terms of the acquisition of language-based thinking skills, then they too should be viewed as important milestones in supporting subsequent learning across the curriculum throughout compulsory schooling. Although many aspects of human cognition are first developed prior to birth they gradually mature with the passage of time: from infancy into toddlerhood, the child's thought processes undergo fundamental transformations leading himher to discover logical rules governing hisher actions so as to eventually form rational ideas and ultimately able to reason logically concerning things he she sees, touches, smells, hears and tastes [Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey Fisher (2002); cited Shaw CorbettMcFadyen 2001]. Acquiring these forms of higher-order cognitive function requires exposure to both concrete objects relevant to specific daily-living situations [Lindsay-Smith (2006a) cited Cordy Smith (2007 and symbolic representations used to communicate meanings across diverse domains (e.g. written script). At the very least a child's conceptualisation of 'the world out there' thus becomes dependent on the combination of sensory input gained via direct contact with their immediate surroundings and indirect sources of information drawn largely from stories read to them andor narrated to them directly by others. Hence, knowing how often and how long something takes to happen provides just as much importance in determining optimal decision-making successes as using logic whilst completing demanding long-term planning tasks: o]nly... good judgment is enough for making decisions without delay... [in contrast] bad judgments make us act hastily in cases when our choices seem simple and straightforward [Cordy Smith, (2008). p.2l7] Thus, for example, slow response times coupled with inappropriate judgements can result in failed attempts to complete challenging activities e.g. putting food into mouths full and needing frequent reminders: "" (...) they tend to find it difficult to put food down once it's reached their mouths"" [Macfarlane-Dickinson (1990), cited"

A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree. Is this not a misuse of the term? They are commonly referred to as ""leavers' assemblies,"" so I guess the term has been misappropriated. It's a bit like calling the middle two years of primary school ""junior high,"" when in fact high school starts at 11. One would hope that the primary school kids would be doing a bit more graduating when they leave secondary school. A couple of years ago I attended the ""graduation"" of my nephew from high school. His school has a very large population of Pacific Island students, and many of them wore traditional dress. This was quite moving and added greatly to the importance of the occasion. I personally dislike these ceremonies. They are far too common now and in some cases, they are just an excuse to sell more stuff. We had a ceremony for our child for kindergarten, another for grade 1 and another for grade 2. After that, we decided to stop the nonsense and did not participate in any more ceremonies. I don't think it's necessary to have a ceremony for every single grade. It diminishes the importance of the true graduation ceremony. Susan, how do you think that graduations ""diminish the importance of the true graduation ceremony""? I don't understand that. It is a common misconception to think that there is a ceremony for every grade. My school does have a ceremony for every grade, but that is because the students change to a different school in the next grade. They move on to a different school with a different student body. There is no problem in having a ceremony for every grade if the students need to move on to a different school for the next grade. But that's the thing. They don't need to move on to a different school. The same students attend kindergarten and then grade 1 through 6. So why do we need a ceremony every year? Susan, I'm just trying to understand your logic. Are you saying that in the primary years children don't really ""graduate"" to the next classgrade? At our school, we have a leavers' assembly, but it's not really a graduation, and it's not a misnomer. Children are not graduating from anything. They are finishing one year and moving on to the next. This is the same for every single year. What is the point in having a ceremony for every single year? My son's school has a graduation ceremony for the 6th graders only. Children don't graduate in the UK until they leave Secondary School. The terms Graduation and Graduate are very often misused. I think this is because of the vagueness of the terms. When a person completes a course of study at university, they graduate from that university. They are a graduate of that university. They graduate with an undergraduate degree. When a person completes a postgraduate course of study at university, they graduate from that university. They are a graduate of that university. They graduate with a postgraduate degree. When a person has completed their undergraduate degree, and they want to pursue a postgraduate course of study, they are a postgraduate student. The terms can be very confusing. I think it would be better to just use the term ""student"" to avoid confusion. It should be noted that the terms ""graduation"" and ""graduate"" are not used at all for a person who has completed their postgraduate course of study. The graduation ceremony is held for students who have completed their undergraduate degrees. When a person has completed their postgraduate degree, they are called ""postgraduates."" There is no graduation ceremony for postgraduates. I can't help but wonder if the misuse of these terms is a result of American influence. Americans tend to call all university students ""graduates,"" even when they are still studying and have not graduated yet. In the UK, a person is a student if they are studying for a degree, and they are a graduate if they have graduated from university. I agree. They should just be called ""leavers' assemblies."" I am not sure why this has been posted in the misused words section, when there are no words which are misused. My school has a 'graduation' ceremony for every grade. In my opinion, that is"
OpenAI,cmv-161,"There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree or diploma, typically after completing a university or college programme. However, this trend has emerged as a way to celebrate and acknowledge children's transition from one stage of education to another. While some people argue that celebrating these milestones can boost children's self-esteem and provide a sense of accomplishment, others criticize this trend for trivializing the significance of an actual graduation from secondary school or university. Moreover, some argue that it puts unnecessary pressure on children to perform and achieve certain academic milestones at very young ages. Ultimately, whether or not to hold graduation ceremonies for children leaving infant and primary schools is a matter of personal opinion. However, it is important to ensure that such events do not inadvertently create undue stress or pressure for young children, and that they are handled in an appropriate and sensitive manner."
OpenAI,cmv-162,"The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless we are talking about something that is entirely created by human intervention or technology, everything can be considered natural in some sense. However, the distinction between natural and human-made products or substances can be useful because there are often differences in their qualities, effects, and ecological impact. For example, natural materials like wood, cotton, and wool are biodegradable and renewable, while synthetic materials like plastic and nylon are often not. Also, natural products like herbal remedies and essential oils may have different effects on the body than synthetic drugs or chemicals. Moreover, it can be argued that the distinction between natural and human-made is not absolute, but rather a continuum. Humans have been manipulating and modifying nature for thousands of years through agriculture, animal breeding, and selection of plants for particular traits. So, even products or substances that we consider natural may have been altered or influenced by human intervention over time."

Tsinghua,cmv-162,"The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless the 'natural' state is of a person who is in a state of complete ignorance of all of their humanness, why is the term 'natural' not applicable to humans? I don't see why we have to be so separated from our human natures. The other thing that disturbs me is the idea of a 'natural order'. What is this supposed to mean? A sort of higher power that creates all the natural laws that govern our lives? It seems that the idea of a higher power has been superimposed on top of the 'natural order'. I'm not sure how the 'natural order' can exist in a world that has been created by a higher power. It seems to me that we are a part of the natural order, and a part of the higher power. As far as I know, we have no idea what the 'natural order' is. Perhaps the idea is to bring us back to our natural state of being. This sounds a bit far fetched to me. I'm more inclined to think that the 'natural order' is simply what is, regardless of the effects of any higher power. A: Premise 1: The phrase ""God is natural"" is not a biblical concept. The phrase ""God is natural"" appears in the 1891 English translation of the King James Version of the Bible, but not in the original Hebrew or Greek texts. Premise 2: The Bible does not define ""natural"" as anything other than what it says it is. The Bible does not say that God is ""natural."" The Bible does not say that God is not ""natural."" The Bible does not say that God is anything other than what it says it is. The word ""natural"" is not defined in the Bible. Premise 3: There is no other evidence for the existence of a ""natural order."" There is no other evidence for the existence of a ""higher power."" The existence of these things is based on faith. The existence of these things is based on conjecture. The existence of these things is based on ignorance. Conclusion: The phrase ""God is natural"" is a philosophical concept, not a biblical concept. There is no other evidence for the existence of a ""natural order."" There is no other evidence for the existence of a ""higher power."" The existence of these things is based on faith. The existence of these things is based on conjecture."
BigScience,cmv-162,"The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless we take away all the characteristics that distinguishes human beings then what makes them different in the first place? In humans (and animals) we have an innate urge to be social, not just for pleasure but because it helps us achieve our goals. This 'egoistic instinct' explains how our good will can lead us astray when we act against others -we do so under pressure or coercion. In contrast with natural selection which evolves traits within populations over time, cultural evolution occurs within societystructures. The result is often an unbalanced society where those who prosper most are also those who benefit least. A powerful example of this imbalance was provided by the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset. He saw two extremes about humanity: 1.) Some people were happy living amongst other men as subordinates; they lived in fear of being offended, humiliated, hated, even killed if they dared speak their minds. They accepted their fate without question and never raised any objections. 2.) Those few who had some pride and independence could live at ease amongst many others knowing how hard everyone else worked to get ahead. Such superiority made these individuals mistrustful towards those whose lives seemed more secure than their own. They felt threatened and envious. These attitudes quickly spread across societies until words like 'power','supremacy' and 'exclusivity' became associated with certain groups. Ortega's view on inequality is now widely seen as archaic and has been replaced by views such as John Rawls' theory of justice. Yet his ideas remain influential today among conservatives. Many argue that the emergence of inequalities is inevitable since getting better education leads to employment opportunities while poor families must resort to crime or prostitution to survive. As one economist recently put it: 'In modern democratic conditions of capitalism, an unequal distribution of wealth becomes socially acceptable only after generations of political struggle. If you want democracy to work well you need to tolerate unequal income distribution. You can't expect instant universality'. This principle is supported by evidence showing that the richest ten percent of adults in Britain earn twice as much as the poorest half. That means working class parents cannot provide enough money for children going to private schools while those mothers in higher classes tend to pay for expensive tuition courses for students. What does this say about values? Does equality mean ensuring equal access to basic resources regardless of background or ability? Is universal education important? Should careers in science be rewarded equally? Do women deserve equal rights outside marriage? These are questions beyond the scope of traditional economic theories and I believe they should receive major attention given the pervasive effects they have on society. There is no doubt that policies inspired by value-pluralism would make life easier for ordinary citizens. However, government policy makers rarely debate issues directly related to values. Public Policy versus Personal Values Fundamental Rights vs Privileges If natural law claims moral authority then it may seem difficult to justify laws based upon personal preferences. For instance, a man might claim that he wants to marry someone older than himself, having heard nothing bad said about old age relationships. Or perhaps she prefers boys rather than girls so that her daughter will inherit more property later. How can such behaviour be justified as morally correct? To answer this question requires assuming that governments have the right to enforce norms such as: The state does not allow discrimination between citizens simply because of individuals' beliefs or gender. It allows religious minorities to express themselves freely. Lives matter irrespective of whether a person survives or dies. However, in countries such as Germany, Austria and Belgium it appears that governments feel obliged to follow the dictates of public opinion regarding rules governing intimate relationships. Sex offenders, paedophiles and anyone convicted of sexual abuse are prevented from marrying normal couples. A recent US study found that the average lifespan of married heterosexual couples is 11 years shorter than single ones. Therefore, politicians appear to agree that'marriage is best left alone' if the number of divorced individuals increases. And yet another report shows that divorce continues to grow steadily: almost 5 million Americans already separated or divorced in 2004 compared with less than 1 million in 1970.1 At present children born into such unions usually face severe challenges ranging from precarious financial circumstances through bullying in school and low self-esteem to possible suicide attempts. Similar trends occur everywhere according to studies covering nearly 30 OECD nations.2 Divorces appear to increase during periods of fastgrowing population growth, especially due to rising levels of educational achievement and lower fertility rates.3 Since 1995 divorcees received significantly fewer benefits,4 went through worse housing market experiences5 and suffered longer unemployment spells6 than those remaining married. Such results demonstrate that despite official promises by national government officials, institutions seeking to protect privacy reveal a close relationship to local culture and history. It seems clear that people's fantasies concerning traditional family structures continue to exert strong influence even though they are considered harmful by many psychologists. Given that institutional regulations largely reflect customs established centuries ago, it seems reasonable to assume that today's"

OpenAI,cmv-164,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal I'm sorry, but I need a bit more information to fully understand your view. What specifically are you arguing about? Can you provide more context or details about your argument?"
PaLM,cmv-164,"1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal, there is still a lot of time for the rest of the world to react. It takes approximately 30 minutes for an ICBM to travel from North Korea to the United States. That means that the United States has at least 30 minutes to launch its own missiles and defend itself. 2: Even if North Korea were able to destroy all of the major cities in the United States, it would not be able to destroy the entire country. The United States is a very large and diverse country, and there are many places where people could go to escape the bombs. 3: The United States has a very strong military, and it would be able to retaliate against North Korea if it were attacked. North Korea would not be able to withstand a full-scale attack from the United States. 4: Even if North Korea were able to destroy the United States, it would not be able to destroy the rest of the world. There are many other countries that would be able to come to the aid of the United States and help to rebuild it. 5: The world would be a very different place if North Korea were to launch a nuclear attack, but it would not be the end of the world. The United States and the rest of the world would be able to recover from such an attack, and life would go on."
Human,cmv-164,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal at us there most likely nothing we could do to stop the missiles from destroying us. This essentially means we have lost at this point and there's nothing we can do about it. To launch the nukes at that point becomes an act of revenge accomplishes absolutely nothing for anyone. 2: To launch these nukes hurts innocent people in whatever country attacked us who likely had no choice in the launches and causes us to sink down to the level that the agressing country sits at. 3: Returning fire almost certainly bears the promise of environmental collapse and in doing so dooms everyone on the planet as well as billions of species of plants and animals. If we don't launch and instead let ourselves be hit we still have the possibility of saving the world entire. If I remember any of my other points I will edit them into the main post.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-164,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal at us, what will the US do? Will it just say ""We're sorry we attacked you so hard but now that our aircraft carriers are out in deep water these missiles can't reach back to them""? Or maybe something like ...""we regretfully announce today's attack on your country has been cancelled until further notice..."" That would be funny:) 2) If China (or anyone else for which such attacks might cause some kind loss or damage...) does NOT launch its own retaliatory strike against Japan THEN - according as far human history goes after hitting FranceBritain first Russia WILL hit Germany next followed by Italy etc... Then when everything gets finished up America itself becomes one target among many 3rd world countries fighting each other every day over who got more land stolen from whom 4th-generation nukes were supposed not only refused being used because there wasn't time left during WWII since USA still didn' t possess any anyway 5) The conclusion comes naturally From above three points When controlling whole Pacific Ocean region including Asian regions nations tend very much towards use nuclear weapons if someone tries attacking those territories.. So why should Japanese territory belong ""anywhere"" different than others? 1"
LLAMA,cmv-164,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal in the first volley, how many warheads would we need to hit them in order to end the conflict before their first volley landed? If we can strike them fast enough, we can end the conflict before any of their missiles hit and without needing to fire any additional warheads. 2: Is it not possible that we could launch a limited retaliatory strike to the point of their being absolutely no doubt that we would strike them again if they were to strike us again? I would say if there is a way to end it without firing a shot, we should. If we can be 100 certain that they will not strike us again, we should be fine with that. If we can't be certain, then we should fire a limited strike with the clear intent of escalation, if they decide to fire again. There is a problem with that. The response to an attack must be immediate, or the enemy would have all the time in the world to eliminate any retaliatory strike capacity. This is why there is talk of ""launch on warning"" type scenarios. You detect an incoming attack, and launch before they can destroy your ability to retaliate. But there is also the question of how many warheads you need to eliminate the enemy's ability to retaliate. MX was designed to give you a land-based retaliatory force that could survive a nuclear exchange and then respond. There was also the hope that a limited retaliatory strike could be used to prevent further attacks. Now that the US is reliant on missile submarines, I have to wonder if the US has lost the ability to respond in kind to an attack. Assuming we have a limited nuclear exchange, what ability would we have to respond in kind? Or would we have to hold back a number of warheads in the hope of deterring further attacks? There is an argument for the Russians that they need to maintain a large missile force, because they have no other way of responding to a US nuclear attack. As I understand it, the Russians have more missiles than we do, so in theory they should be able to survive a US first strike and launch a counterstrike. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal in the first volley, how many warheads would we need to hit them in order to end the conflict before their first volley landed? As many as possible, of course. But what if they have yet to launch their entire arsenal and decide to launch an additional volley after you've launched a retaliatory strike? You're going to be in a very bad spot then. 2: Is it not possible that we could launch a limited retaliatory strike to the point of their being absolutely no doubt that we would strike them again if they were to strike us again? It's possible, but are you prepared to gamble the future of your country on the possibility that they'll be deterred by that limited strike? If it's a madman in charge of the country that attacked you, you can be certain that he'll launch everything he has left. There is also the chance that the country that attacked you has absolutely no intention of launching a second strike. They might just be satisfied with the destruction they've already caused. So why would you launch a second strike if you can be reasonably sure that there won't be a second strike against you? I understand the thinking behind MAD, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Why would you want to destroy the entire world when you can just destroy a portion of it? I think the only scenario where it would make sense is if you believe that your country will be destroyed if you don't destroy the other country, which is to say that the other country will destroy you if you don't destroy it first. I think there is a solution to this problem: abolish nuclear weapons and destroy your nuclear arsenal. So how do you prevent the destruction of your country when your enemy launches a first strike against you? There is no point to this. The other country will destroy itself. So why should you? This is the point of MAD. You are saying that the other country will destroy itself so why should you. But if you don't, the other country will still destroy you. If you know the other country is going to destroy you, you might as well take it with you. I think we should be prepared to launch as many warheads as we have at the other country, and destroy as much as"
Tsinghua,cmv-164,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal, why would they risk a nuclear attack? If the U.S. were to launch a nuclear attack, they would most likely strike against strategic locations (as in the homeland, bases, etc.) to prevent the U.S. from launching a retaliation. However, the U.S. would most likely strike back, causing the U.S. and their allies to suffer more casualties than they would have if they had just launched a limited conventional attack. It would be much better for them to avoid the risk of a nuclear attack. 2: A nuclear attack would cause an arms race. It is already difficult for both sides to maintain nuclear arsenals that would be enough to protect against the other side. However, it would be impossible to maintain that kind of arsenal if both sides are launching nuclear attacks. It would be too risky. 3: I think the reason the U.S. hasn't attacked Syria yet is because the U.S. doesn't want to risk it. The U.S. is still trying to avoid getting sucked into a war. If the U.S. launches a limited conventional attack, it would most likely fail and then Russia andor Syria would retaliate, and the U.S. would be dragged into a much bigger war than they want to get into. So, from my point of view, a limited conventional attack is a better option than a nuclear attack. I'm just trying to figure out if I'm right or wrong. Thank you. A: The key thing to understand about this is that the United States has been trying to avoid a ""powder keg"" scenario in Syria for a long time. The US government has been planning for the day when a conflict could break out between the Syrian government and various opposition groups that could become a proxy war for a larger regional war with Iran. The US has been preparing for a potential military intervention against Syria since 2011. In 2012, Obama authorized covert operations against Syria. In 2013, the Obama administration sent a proposal to Russia that would have allowed Russia to arm the Syrian government with light weapons to defend against the rebels. In 2014, the US tried to establish a ""no-fly zone"" over Syria, which would have required a large troop deployment. In 2015, the Obama administration authorized a limited air campaign against Syrian government targets, which led to the killing of 2000 civilians. The US has been building up forces in Turkey and the GCC in preparation for a potential intervention against Syria. The US is building up its forces in Turkey in preparation for a potential intervention against Syria. The US is increasing its diplomatic pressure on Russia to ""come to the table"" and negotiate a political solution. This is also part of the ""build up to the bombing campaign."" A large increase in US diplomatic pressure against Russia, as well as a large increase in US military pressure against Syria, is not in the interest of the Russian government. A large increase in US diplomatic pressure against Russia, as well as a large increase in US military pressure against Syria, is not in the interest of the Russian government. The US is seeking to avoid a conflict that it would not win. The US is seeking to avoid a conflict that it would not win. So, what do you think the US is going to do? In my opinion, the US is going to strike Syria with some sort of limited air campaign, which will almost certainly result in the death of thousands of civilians. In my opinion, the US is going to strike Syria with some sort of limited air campaign, which will almost certainly result in the death of thousands of civilians. There is a reason that the US has been building up its forces in Turkey and the GCC. If the US was going to strike Syria with a limited air campaign, they would have done so already.

BigScience,cmv-164,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , there isn't much left to develop in terms of new weapons or ship technologies (unless you count the FTL spacecraft). 2: They can't just kill everyone on Earth because that would be pretty easy if the aliens had allied forces on other planets. 3: The aliens might not even know how powerful humans are yet. I think it is reasonable for them to assume we probably wouldn't go after your planet immediately and so that means our systems aren't up against something like Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope's Battle Of Hoth or something similar from Return To The Jedi (for reference). This also makes sense because most advanced science fiction depicts humanity as being far more technologically superior than what we've seen in real life. What you're talking about is one of those two things; 1) an alien invasion where everything starts going downhill fast and 2) an alien invasion which has many people living happily unaware that we're coming until it's too late.

That is not the case here. The whole point of the article is that ""blackface"" is an extremely old and traditional performance practice, which people in the US are either ignorant of, or they simply don't care about. As someone who grew up in a small town in the Appalachian mountains, I've seen blackface at numerous community events. I've even performed blackface in high school talent shows. And as someone who has spent a great deal of time in Africa and Asia, I've seen blackface in various other cultures, as well. The article is about the lack of respect for the practice, and the way it's been used as a tool of racism in the US. In fact, the article is about the lack of respect for the practice of blackface as a performance practice, not as a racial insult.

I've seen blackface at numerous community events. I've even performed blackface in high school talent shows. That's all true, but it's irrelevant to the issue at hand. The point is that blackface has a history of being used as a tool of racism in the US, and in particular as a way of making fun of African Americans. The article is not about how it's being used in a performance, it's about how it's been used as a tool of racism. 1) I don't see how blackface is a tool of racism, it's a tool of entertainment. 2) I don't see how blackface being a tool of entertainment is relevant to the article. 3) The point of the article is that blackface is an extremely old and traditional performance practice, which people in the US are either ignorant of, or they simply don't care about.

OpenAI,cmv-165,"First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people Thank you for acknowledging the history of blackface. As a helpful assistant, I am here to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have. Is there anything specific you need help with today?"
LLAMA,cmv-165,"First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people. I am also aware that there is still a stigma surrounding the idea of blackface due to that history. I, however, do not believe that that stigma is justified in all cases. I'm a black girl, and I know that I'm not alone in my feelings about this. The truth of the matter is that there are a lot of white people who genuinely enjoy the culture and beauty of black people. Black culture is trendy, and as such, it's not uncommon for a non-black person to want to dress as a black person for Halloween. I think that this is great. In fact, I know a lot of black girls who are excited about dressing up as Kylie Jenner for Halloween. We see her as a black woman, even if she doesn't. As such, I believe that there are some cases in which it is acceptable for a white person to paint their face black. For example, when I was about six years old, my mom took me to see the stage play of The Wiz, and there were white people in the cast playing the roles of black characters. Those people were actors, and they were paid to portray characters who were not themselves. So, I don't think it's fair for them to have to be black in real life just to play a black person. They're just doing their jobs. Also, there are white people who take Halloween so seriously that they just can't be denied the right to transform into one of their favorite black people. If you feel that strongly about it, then who am I to tell you that you can't do it? There are also white people who are going to do it anyway, even if you tell them not to. You may as well let them know that there are some things they should do to avoid looking like a fool. So, if you're a white person who really wants to do blackface this Halloween, here are a few tips that you may want to consider. Do not, under any circumstance, use shoe polish to paint your face. This is probably the most offensive thing that you can do. It's so offensive that I think a black person can make a pretty good case for physically harming you if you do it. I'm not saying it's justified, but it's definitely understandable. I'm not sure if you know this, but shoe polish is a product that was used to polish leather shoes, most notably leather shoes that were worn by slaves. Even if the idea of painting your face black wasn't offensive on its own, the association with shoe polish would make it so. You are better off just not painting your face at all than to do this. Instead, you should use a makeup brand that is specifically made for black skin. As a matter of fact, you should use a brand that is made for women of color with dark skin. This is important because dark skin is not the same as light skin. It's a bit thicker, and the pores are a little larger. The makeup needs to be thick enough to cover those pores, so a brand like Fashion Fair is ideal. Additionally, there are a lot of dark foundation makeups that are made for women with dark skin. These foundations are perfect for you to use for Halloween. I know that you don't want to hear this, but you're just not going to get it right. There's no way that you can paint your face to look exactly like a black person. There's just no way. I'm not saying this to hurt your feelings. It's the truth. You need to accept that the best you can do is to make your face appear darker than it actually is. You can't paint your face and then expect to fool anyone into thinking that you're black. You will not have the texture of black skin. You will not have the facial features of a black person. And you certainly won't have a black person's hair. So, you're not fooling anyone. The best that you can do is to paint your face dark so that people know who you're dressed as for Halloween. So, that's what you need to do. I know that this one is hard, but if you're going to do blackface, you have to do it well. It's not enough to just paint your face dark and call it a day. If you"

Human,cmv-165,"First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people is racist. However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate? There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout ""racism!"" For example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist."
Tsinghua,cmv-166,"Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as time went on, I started to think that maybe there's a part of me that's just really tired of seeing everyone fight each other, and trying to get everyone to stop saying hateful things to each other. So I'm not saying that we should go full circle and be as good as the Nazis. But I'm wondering if we should just give up and stop talking about it?:P I mean, we can always talk about what it is, and why it's wrong, but why do we need to? We're all pretty much free to do whatever we want. But we do need to remember that this is still our country, and I don't want to see anyone start to treat it like they're in another country. So is there a middle ground here? Can we stop hating each other, but still keep our ideals? If not, how do we do it?:P I don't want to see people start to think that just because they're Hungarian, they're better than everyone else. It's really not like that. I'm pretty sure it is.

PaLM,cmv-166,"Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as I've gotten older and traveled more, I've come to realize that it is actually the opposite. Cultural exchange is essential for the preservation of culture. When cultures are isolated from each other, they become stagnant and insular. They lose the ability to adapt to new challenges and eventually die out. By contrast, cultures that are open to outside influences are constantly evolving and changing. They are able to absorb new ideas and adapt them to their own way of life. This process of cultural exchange is what has allowed human culture to flourish for thousands of years. Take, for example, the history of Hungarian culture. Hungary has been invaded and occupied by many different cultures throughout its history, including the Romans, the Huns, the Mongols, and the Turks. Each of these invasions had a profound impact on Hungarian culture, but they also helped to make it stronger. The Romans introduced Christianity to Hungary, which became the dominant religion. The Huns brought their own language and culture, which influenced the development of Hungarian. The Mongols introduced new technologies and military tactics, which helped Hungary to become a powerful kingdom. And the Turks brought their own cuisine and music, which are still enjoyed by Hungarians today. All of these different influences have made Hungarian culture what it is today. It is a rich and diverse culture that is constantly evolving. And it is all thanks to cultural exchange. Of course, cultural exchange is not always easy. There can be conflict and misunderstandings between different cultures. But it is important to remember that these are just growing pains. In the end, cultural exchange is the only way to ensure that our cultures continue to thrive. So, if you are a patriotic Hungarian, don't be afraid of cultural exchange. Embrace it! It is the best way to ensure that your culture will survive and thrive for generations to come. Here are some specific examples of how cultural exchange has benefited Hungarian culture:  The Roman invasion of Hungary introduced Christianity to the country. This had a profound impact on Hungarian culture, as it became the dominant religion. Christianity brought with it new ideas and values, which helped to shape Hungarian society.  The Huns also had a significant impact on Hungarian culture. They brought their own language and culture, which influenced the development of Hungarian. The Huns also introduced new technologies and military tactics, which helped Hungary to become a powerful kingdom.  The Mongols invaded Hungary in the 13th century. They brought with them new technologies and military tactics, which helped Hungary to defend itself against future invasions. The Mongols also introduced new foods and music, which are still enjoyed by Hungarians today.  The Turks ruled Hungary for over 150 years. They brought with them their own cuisine, music, and culture. These influences can still be seen in Hungary today. All of these different cultures have contributed to the rich and diverse culture of Hungary. It is a culture that is constantly evolving and changing, and it is all thanks to cultural exchange."
LLAMA,cmv-166,"Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as my English is not so great, I find it hard to argue with them and explain my thoughts. I would love to see if I'm correct in my beliefs, and if so, a little support would be nice, so that I can finally beat this into their heads. In my country, there is a state-funded education system, which also involves a mandatory language test, which aims to determine the level of language education. The lowest score is 1.5, the highest is 5. However, after this test, there are a number of ""levels"" of mandatory foreign language education, and you can only attend high school if you have 3 (in the case of English) or 4 (in the case of German). Now, this ""level"" is based on the test I mentioned, and I find this highly unfair. A person with a 2 score can barely form a sentence in the language, yet their level is high enough to attend high school. Contrast this with a person who has a 3.5 score, meaning they can actually speak the language, and know what they're doing, yet cannot attend high school. Now, I don't believe there is a problem with this system, at all. The problem is the test. This test is (or was) conducted by the state, and the questionnaires are available to everyone. This means that the test doesn't actually test your ability to learn a language, but rather how good you are at the test. If you have the money, you can pay a tutor to teach you how to ace the test, and then you are good to go. If you don't, then you're doomed. I don't know if you are familiar with the Hungarian school system, but I can assure you that it is not the best one out there. It is an institution that values knowledge of facts over practical knowledge. As such, a person who has ""completed"" the mandatory level of foreign language education will actually not be able to speak the language, because of how the school system works. This results in an entire generation of people who cannot speak a language, but are stuck with 3 or 4 points on their diploma. I know that this is a very long story, but I hope that you get the gist of it. So, what do you think? I would love to hear some foreign opinions on this matter. Re: Thoughts on language education in Hungary From what I can tell, your public education system is a mess. It's very unfair to judge someone on how well they can take a test, and then base their entire future on that. And I'm not sure I get the point of this test. Why not just make sure everyone is taught the same amount of language in school, and then let them test into higher levels of education? I can't say that I know your language or the one you are trying to learn, but I think you are right. If you are already able to speak and understand some, it is pretty stupid to be tested on how well you can take a test, rather than just your ability to speak the language. It sounds like you might know more than you are given credit for. Thanks for the reply, and sorry for the late response. The point of the test is that the government wants to ""unify"" the level of education. So, they set up a standard that you have to meet. I hope this is clearer. Yeah, this is pretty much the case. The government has just decided to set a goal for everyone, and then make them follow the same path, regardless of their abilities. Ahh, I see. If that is the case, then I think you are right. The government should be focusing more on teaching the language, rather than testing how well students can take a test. Sorry I'm late replying. I've had a lot going on lately. In Canada, we have our own problems with education, but it is very different from yours. Our main problems revolve around the funding of the schools, and how the government is trying to make the education system more standardized. One of the main problems is that we have separate schools for the English and French speaking populations. The funding is different for each school, so there are often concerns that one population is getting better quality education than the other. I'm not sure how that compares to your situation, but we definitely have our own issues to deal with. The point of the test is that the government wants to ""unify"

However, as the US has been in decline for some time now while Hungary is still growing economically every year since joining EU - maybe we should think about re-inventing ourselves culturally also?

And none seem too bad at present either by any measure where being American hasn't become synonymous only meaning wealth these days:)"
Human,cmv-166,"Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups. I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing. First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way Then, they started to form small tribal communities Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes"" Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones. Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain. I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most.... with different strategies, investiture focuses. The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders. Hello, users of CMV!

BigScience,cmv-167,"1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what ""justices"" and are using it to say ""it was ok!""in a more powerful way so a more fitting way would be ""it had nothing whatsoever wrong with it,"" such as saying ""the show has no right for banning the character of chloe, since she didn't do anything wrong that makes her deserve being killed off."" 2.thats my point about justicesrights: things like this can easily go either way: you could use something that appeared in tv or movie (something that doesn't seem very likely but i am not trying to make any predictions) but then why can't they just say ""i have always wanted to kill him except now he is dead...so therefore killing him wouldn't matter because it's already happened and there's nothing I can do about it""? there are any number of examples where doing X means Y will happen which may only partly relate to justicesince innocent characters should stay alive anyway 3.what's actually happening here isn't that they aren't going to die. it's that they're going on vacation with their family instead of getting stabbed by some random person somewhere. yes one thing that's come up before when discussing death from tv is how much we think those shows get away with murdering people without anyone ever knowing what's really going on...but in reality those shows run on fiction. why should they take risks if the whole purpose of running a storyline is the risk? 4.i'm sure she's been acting pretty badly towards them lately..heck, even earlier than last week everyone else knew all along that she'd spend the rest of season 1 behind bars despite showing herself completely uninterested in helping giovanna to get free! 5.however im also aware of the fact that both gio and mikey never thought they'd see each other again after getting out of prison. they were both planning mostly on staying anonymous until they got into town..that's probably part of why they've chosen to travel around europe and asia together rather than coming back home.. 6.since the two main cliff hangers at end of series 2 was whether mikey was still okay and whether joe would find his sister alive..now there's a chance these events could affect future seasons and yet another possibility for season 3 is ""gio"" might finally return"
PaLM,cmv-167,"1. Firstly, most people who say it is justified don't understand what ""justice"" means and are using it to say ""it was okay!"" in a more powerful way. So a more fitting way to say this would be: ""Most people who say it is justified are using the word incorrectly."" 2. Secondly, even if we accept the premise that it was justified, that does not mean that it was right. Just because something is justified does not make it morally good. For example, it may be justified to kill someone in self-defense, but that does not mean that it is morally right. 3. Finally, even if we accept the premise that it was justified and that it was morally right, that does not mean that it should be celebrated. There are many things that are justified and morally right that we do not celebrate. For example, we do not celebrate the fact that we have to pay taxes, even though it is justified and morally right. So, while it may be possible to make an argument that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was justified, it is important to remember that this does not mean that it was right or that it should be celebrated."
Tsinghua,cmv-167,"1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what ""justices"" and are using it to say ""it was ok! ""in a more powerful way so a more fitting way would be ""thats what justice was"" 2.the problem with justice is that it is one of those things that doesn't really exist it is an idea and idea's are just made up by humans to explain things that don't make sense or that make no sense and humans use the word justice to explain things that make no sense 3.what does it mean to be just? if there is no universal law that defines it then there can be no just cause. and if there is no just cause then there can be no just punishment. that is why the saying ""no good deed goes unpunished"" is a myth 4.the reason why punishment is needed is because of the way that humans act in the world, and to stop that from happening the only thing that is going to stop it is to use punishment, so if there is no just cause then there is no just punishment. because of the above I don't think that it was justified to kill the ""just people"" in the story. if they had been unjust, then it would have been justified. If you are doing something unjust, but you don't know that you are, then it is not justified. In this case the people knew they were unjust. The just people in the story were a group of women who knew that the men were killing their sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and grandfathers, but they still did nothing to stop it. They had no right to kill the men. That was not their responsibility. If the men were just, then it would have been justified to kill the women. But if the men were unjust, then it was not justified to kill the women. The men were justified in killing the women because the women knew that the men were doing something wrong. If they had not known that the men were doing something wrong, then they would have been justified in killing the men. So it was not justified to kill the women because the men knew that they were doing something wrong. It was also not justified to kill the men because they did not know that they were doing something wrong. Explain the actions of a woman who is ordered to burn her son and husband alive.

OpenAI,cmv-168,"I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people's tattoos for inspiration. It's definitely worth doing some research and finding a style you like or an image that speaks to you. However, you also want to make sure that the tattoo is meaningful to you and that you won't regret it later on. Take some time to reflect on why you want the tattoo and what it represents to you. It's also important to find a reputable tattoo artist who can help you bring your vision to life. Don't just go to the cheapest artist or the one that's closest to you. Look for someone who has experience in the style you want and has a portfolio of great work. Ultimately, it's your body and your decision, so take your time and make sure you're happy with the design and the artist before getting inked."
LLAMA,cmv-168,"I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people with tattoos. Then they find something that they like and want to duplicate it. I'm not going to debate the merits of having a duplicate of someone else's work. If you want that tattoo, then you should get it. What I will say is that there is a definite difference between having the same tattoo and having the same tattoo design. Tattoos are on skin. The design is a template to work with. The placement, the size, the colors, the lines, the shading, the integration with the body's contoursthese are all different for each person. I had a woman come in with a photo of an anchor tattoo. She wanted it on her ribs, and she wanted it in the same colors, and she wanted it to look like the photo. And I told her that I couldn't do that. I told her that I could do a similar tattoo, but it would be different. I said I'd give it a try, but that she had to be okay with the final product looking different. She said she was fine with that. I did the tattoo, and she was pleased with the result. It was different, but not too different. I've seen tattoos that were identical to the original and I've seen tattoos that had only the barest resemblance to the original. It all depends on the artist and the art. If you're going to get a tattoo that is an exact duplicate, then do some research. Find an artist who specializes in that type of art. If you're going to get something similar, then you're going to have to trust your artist. I'm not a fan of tattooing eyeballs. They're difficult to get right. There are many different techniques, but in the end, it's a matter of getting the light source correct, the angle of the eyelid correct, the amount of eye showing correct, the color and shape of the iris correct, the depth of the eye correct, and the shading correct. It's a matter of taking a three dimensional object and making it look right on a two dimensional surface. I've been tattooing for over twenty years, and I've done eyeball tattoos. Some have worked out and some haven't. The best tattoos are done with good art, good placement, and good application. Tattoos are a form of expression. And, as with any form of expression, there is a learning curve. I've been tattooing for over twenty years, and I've learned a lot. I've learned that certain things don't work, and that some things do. When I started out, I was in a small town. I had to do everything. I didn't specialize in anything. I did whatever came through the door. I did portrait tattoos, tribal tattoos, abstract tattoos, celtic tattoos, realistic tattoos, floral tattoos, etc. And I did a lot of bad tattoos. I learned to keep my tattoos simple. I learned to work within my limitations. The better you know yourself as an artist, the better your tattoos will be. I've seen many examples of tattoos that were the first tattoo someone got. There are the usual suspects: barbed wire, Chinese characters, etc. I've never understood the desire to get a barbed wire tattoo. I've been around barbed wire. I know how it looks, how it feels, and what it does. I know what it's like to be tangled up in it, and what it's like to have it cut through your skin. I've never understood the desire to have Chinese characters tattooed on you. I've been to China. I know how the characters look, how they sound, and what they mean. I've never understood the desire to have a celtic knot tattoo. I'm part Irish. I know what those knots look like. I know what they mean. I've seen all three tattoos done well. I've seen them done poorly. I've seen them done really, really poorly. If you're going to get a tattoo, do your research. Don"

Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people's tattoos and then decide to get one of the same. I don't see the problem with this. I see the problem with the fact that you can't just copy a tattoo and not get in trouble for it. Also, why is it that you can only get a tattoo in one place? I'm sure there are lots of places where you can get tattooed and you can't just walk in and get a tattoo. There are several places in NYC that you can get tattooed at and I don't know any of them. There's always some excuse for this and the people who get tattooed don't want to admit it. I'm not saying that they are doing anything wrong. I just don't understand why people think that they can just walk in and get a tattoo. It's not like a car dealership where you can just walk in and get a car. I'm sure that there are plenty of places in New York where you can get tattooed but the reality is that there aren't many of them. I don't think that people need to worry about this.

PaLM,cmv-168,"I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people with tattoos and they think, ""I want that!"" So they go get a tattoo, and they're happy with it for a while. But then, a few months or years later, they start to regret it. They don't like the way it looks anymore, or they don't like the meaning behind it anymore, or they just don't want it anymore. And then they're stuck with it. There are a few things you can do to avoid this. First, do your research. Make sure you know what you're getting into before you get a tattoo. Talk to your artist about the design, the placement, and the meaning. Make sure you're happy with everything before you put it on your body. Second, don't get a tattoo just because you think it's cool. Tattoos are permanent, so you should only get one if you're really sure that you want it. Don't get a tattoo just because your friends have them, or because you saw a celebrity with one, or because you think it's trendy. Get a tattoo because you love it and you want to have it on your body for the rest of your life. Third, think about the placement of your tattoo. A tattoo on your arm or leg is easy to cover up, but a tattoo on your face or neck is not. Make sure you're okay with having your tattoo visible all the time before you get it. Fourth, make sure you're getting your tattoo from a reputable artist. A good artist will take the time to listen to you and design a tattoo that you'll love. They'll also use high-quality equipment and sterile procedures to minimize the risk of infection. Finally, take care of your tattoo after you get it. This means keeping it clean and moisturized, and avoiding sun exposure. If you do this, your tattoo will heal properly and you'll be able to enjoy it for years to come. Getting a tattoo is a big decision, so it's important to do your research and make sure you're getting what you want. By following these tips, you can avoid any regrets and have a tattoo that you'll love for the rest of your life."

On one hand it's a beautiful piece, on the other, I never want to have a similar one to that, as I'd feel I was just copying the other person. Whenever I ask a friend why they picked a tattoo from a portfolio, their answer is never far from ""because I think it's cool,"" so elaorating beyond that would be best I suppose. Is this a normal feelling? It seems perfectly normal to look for inspiration on other things, but then again, it makes me feel as if the art isn't as original as it should be. Thanks!

OpenAI,cmv-169,"From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have any accomplishments or contributions to American history, but his legacy is fraught with controversy and criticism. He was a slave owner who supported and signed into law the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly relocated Native American tribes off their lands and resulted in the Trail of Tears, a tragic and devastating event in American history. Additionally, Jackson's economic policies contributed to the Panic of 1837 and his treatment of political opponents was seen as authoritarian and undemocratic. While there are certainly arguments for including him on U.S. currency, many people believe that there are other historical figures whose legacies are more worthy of the honor."

It's not like the guy didn't have good qualities or do good things while in office, but for a country that's trying to go in the direction of racialethnic inclusiveness, it's pretty baffling that the guy who's responsible for the trail of tears is on our currency. That being said, I thought it was interesting to see in the news that people are trying to change who is on the 20 bill; however, Harriet Tubman seems like an odd choice considering the other possible candidates. Off the top of my head, I think Teddy Roosevelt and MLK are the most deserving, and if I had to choose between them it would be MLK. Obviously, MLK's legacy speaks for itself, being the leader of the civil rights movement. Compared to Tubman I just feel like MLK's impact was far greater. His speeches and non-violent protests impacted the entire nation, millions of people, while Tubman saved 70 people from slavery. That's not to discredit Tubman because what she did was brave and important, and her accomplishments weren't limited to the underground railroad, but I think it's fair to say that MLK had a greater impact than Tubman, and therefore is more deserving to be placed on the 20 bill.

It's not like the guy didn't have some good qualities, but he was, in my opinion, one of the least consequential of our Presidents. But the dude was a smooth talker, so there is that. He was a great man for sure, but it's undeniable that his biggest claim to fame is his death. I'm not sure that he was a ""great"" man, in the truest sense of the word. He was an intelligent and well-intentioned man, but ultimately a bit of a dandy and dilettante who was, in my opinion, in over his head. He was a man with no real core beliefs, and while he was an excellent orator, his rhetoric was all he really had. It's a testament to the greatness of the United States that Lincoln could be elected President. I have a hard time believing that a man who was not a slaveholder and could have easily passed on the matter without much controversy. If he had never been elected president, he would have been known as a man who opposed slavery on principle, and that's about it. That's not my understanding of how he came to his position on the issue. No, but it was the death of the first president to be assassinated and the rampant speculation that followed his death that made him memorable. Andrew Jackson was a pretty cool dude. He wasn't a slaveholder, but he was also a dude that shot a guy for insulting his wife's honor, and then killed him in a duel. So, yeah. The dude was pretty cool. I'm curious as to why you say that. I know very little about him. It's generally accepted that Lincoln's political ambitions came before his opposition to slavery. He was not an abolitionist, and in fact, he supported the Corwin Amendment, which would have made slavery permanent in the South. He was not a slaveholder and was opposed to slavery. But that was not his primary reason for opposing the expansion of slavery, or for his election. He was not an abolitionist. I'm not really familiar with the Corwin Amendment, but his position changed over time. I think Lincoln's position was very much a reflection of where most of the country was on the issue. Lincoln was also a poor administrator, and was responsible for some of the worst generals in American military history (save for Ulysses S. Grant, who had some rough patches early on in the Civil War). The man was a politician first and foremost, and a lawyer second. He was not a military mind, and his military career was laughable at best. While that's certainly true, that's not the point I was making. I think a lot of people have an inflated view of Lincoln's motivations and effectiveness during the Civil War. I think we may be talking about two different issues. I'm speaking of his early political career. Lincoln's journey on the issue of slavery is a long and complex one. I think that by the time of the Civil War, Lincoln had come to believe that slavery should be abolished, but he was not a firebrand on the issue. I didn't see a single reference to the Civil War in your post. Lincoln was a man of the time, and his ""journey"" was one that mirrored the rest of the North. You're right. I misread your post. That was supposed to be a general comment on the man, not a specific rebuttal to anything you said. My mistake. I have no idea what I was thinking."

PaLM,cmv-170,"Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others who were born elsewhere. It is a form of prejudice. It is based on the idea that one’s nationality is the most important thing about them, and that it makes them superior to people from other countries. Nationalism can lead to discrimination and hatred towards people from other countries. It can also lead to war. For example, the First World War was largely caused by nationalism. Countries were competing to be the most powerful, and they were willing to go to war to achieve this. Nationalism can also lead to a sense of superiority and entitlement. People who believe in nationalism often think that their country is the best in the world, and that they are better than people from other countries. This can lead to a lack of respect for other cultures and countries. Nationalism is a dangerous ideology that can lead to conflict and hatred.

LLAMA,cmv-170,"Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. It would make sense if it was used to support one's country in a sports game. But in the real world? Nationalism can easily lead to the same people being seen as a threat or a menace, someone who must be dealt with. It is a distinction that is not based on an actual difference, but only on a made up one. The same goes for white nationalism. In case of white nationalism it is even worse, because it uses the made up distinction of race, not just the made up distinction of nationality. It is racism, not just nationalism. Racism is a harmful distinction. It is a made up difference, which is used to discriminate people, because they are seen as different. It does not matter if this difference is real or not, as it is only made up. But racism is also harmful as it makes people believe, that they are superior to other people just because of their skin color. It is not based on merit. White nationalism is also racist, because it is based on the idea, that people of European ancestry are superior to other people. This is clearly racism, as it is based on the idea of superiority of one ""race"" to other ""race."" There is no such thing as superiority of one race to other. There are different cultures, but culture is not based on race. Culture is based on education and experiences. Culture is something we learn, we are not born with it. Culture is also something that changes with the times. And race is also something we are born with. We do not choose it. And even if race was something that could be chosen, it does not matter what race a person is. It does not make him better or worse. White nationalists have no idea what it means to be white. White nationalists do not know, what it means to be French, German or Polish. They do not know the history of these countries. They do not know the culture of these countries. They do not understand the differences in the cultures. They do not understand the language, the customs, the traditions, the past and the history. They do not understand, that all these things are different for every country. White nationalists only have an idea of what they believe is the white race and what it means to be white. But this is not what it means to be French, German, Polish or any other European nation. They do not understand that all these countries and cultures have different traditions and customs. They do not understand that these countries have had different experiences and different histories. They do not understand that the culture of these countries is not based on race, but on the past of the country and the shared experiences. White nationalists are racists, who do not understand the differences in cultures and try to make the idea of race more important than it is. They do not understand, that race is something that is not based on choice and it is something we are born with. It does not matter if you are white, black or brown. What matters is what kind of person you are. What matters is the values you have. What matters is the choices you make. What matters is your character. And what matters is your education. Race is just one of many characteristics. It is not even the most important one."
BigScience,cmv-171,"Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he's dead; but they all come back to find him alive and well. It's an intriguing plotline for sure - why would anyone leave someone behind? But there is also some questionable scientific data that develops later in the novel. In 2015, British astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson published What If...?, where he argues various scenarios about what might happen if we didn't continue our current life styles into the future (often based off science fiction). In one scenario under consideration was the idea of having EVERYONE on Earth die within hundreds or thousands years due to global climate change caused by human overpopulation. This is something that seems like it could be possible today, unfortunately... ...but not because it's extremely worrying in terms of how far humanity has already gone with climate change concerns. Technically speaking, those people who are left will have no real choice other than to adapt: ""If you've ever been stuck at home without water during a weeklong heat wave (say), then you're familiar with what happens to your body as its temperature increases due to sweating from exertion while trying desperately to consume enough food and drink to keep going,"" says Dr. Amy Earle-Lee, a Research Fellow at the Centre for Future Studies at Cambridge University, UK.

Watney is not dead though, and has to survive on Mars via his wits alone til he can make some contact with Earth (his crewmates having taken all but one radio, and the one they didn't take having stabbed him before flying off. In the book. Watney establishes contact with NASA by driving over to the Sojurner rover and stealingfixing it to transmit to Earth (which...awesome). A few plans are developed to save him, one involving a hastily built probe to resupply him which blows up on takeoff. That first one I buy. But the latter plans I don't. And I have two principal objections. First, it seems like NASA executives make the calls on these. This would not be the case. It would be the President of the United States making the ultimate decision to greenlight projects. And at that level, it seems very unlikely that they'd get the greenlight. The independence of NASA in the book is greatly at odds with how I see government agencies working. The Chinese government would not give a large booster over to NASA like they did. This is portrayed as happening at the agency level coordinating with the Chinese space agency and then presenting it to political leaders as a fait accompli. The plan is super-risky though, and depends on a single resupply mission with a quickly built supply ship - one of which just blew up on the pad. If the resupply doesn't work, all 6 astronauts die. Or 5, if they do space cannibalism. I just don't think the governments of two countries who don't get along great would coordinate to waste hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (the plan also scrubs Ares 4 by taking its ascent vehicle), all to have a very low chance of rescuing one guy at the substantial risk to 5 more people. And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me. Much more likely is that Watney would have been asked to compose letters to whomever he wanted, perform science til his food ran out (assuming he was willing) and then take a lethal dose of morphine.

OpenAI,cmv-171,"Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he is dead. With limited resources and no way to contact Earth, Mark must use his scientific knowledge and ingenuity to survive on the inhospitable planet and find a way to communicate with Earth to ultimately be rescued. Throughout the book, Mark encounters numerous technical challenges and setbacks, including a devastating sandstorm that damages his equipment and leaves him with even fewer resources. However, he perseveres and comes up with creative solutions to problems, such as growing his own food using Martian soil and bacteria and re-purposing other equipment to generate heat and energy. In the end, Mark is able to establish communication with Earth, and a daring rescue mission is launched to bring him home. Despite his isolation and near-death experiences, he maintains his sense of humor and positive attitude, making him a resilient and endearing protagonist.

PaLM,cmv-171,"Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he is dead. The book follows Mark as he uses his ingenuity and engineering skills to survive on the harsh world, while also trying to find a way to signal to Earth that he is still alive. The book is a thrilling and suspenseful story, and it is easy to see why it has been so popular. Mark Watney is a relatable and likable protagonist, and the book does a great job of capturing the challenges of surviving on Mars. The book also has a lot of humor, which helps to lighten the mood at times. One of the things I really enjoyed about the book was the scientific accuracy. Andy Weir, the author of the book, is a scientist himself, and he did a great job of researching the science behind the story. This made the book feel more realistic, and it helped me to better understand the challenges that Mark Watney faced. Another thing I liked about the book was the character development. Mark Watney starts out as a confident and capable astronaut, but as the book progresses, he is forced to learn to rely on himself and to overcome his fears. This character development is very well done, and it makes Mark Watney a more complex and interesting character. Overall, I really enjoyed the book The Martian. It is a thrilling, suspenseful, and scientifically accurate story that will stay with you long after you finish it. I highly recommend it. Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:  ""I'm pretty much okay with being alone on Mars. I'm in good company.""  ""I'm not going to die on this godforsaken planet.""  ""I'm a botanist, not a geologist.""  ""Sol 61: My first Martian sunset. It was a bloody beautiful thing.""  ""Sol 66: I have officially gone to Mars crazy.""  ""I'm going to have to science the shit out of this.""  ""I'm about to piss myself from excitement.""  ""I'm pretty much the luckiest guy in the universe."" The Martian is a great book that I highly recommend. It is a thrilling, suspenseful, and scientifically accurate story that will stay with you long after you finish it."
LLAMA,cmv-171,"Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he is dead. I loved the book. It was a fascinating story that kept my interest the entire time. But, I have a few questions. I think the biggest question I have has to do with the ending of the book. The author leaves Watney stranded, with the crew coming back to rescue him. In the movie, Watney is rescued. The movie is being made by 20th Century Fox, while the book is published by Random House. If the book was published by 20th Century Fox, it is not possible to legally produce an ending different from the movie, but because the two works are produced by different companies, the book has a different ending. Now, I understand that the movie could be a huge success and spawn a whole series of movies. But, because the book is so different, would the first movie be different enough from the book that a sequel would require the author to write another book, which would have to be a ""prequel"" to the first one? I guess that's one of the ways the book and movie could differ. I am not an expert on copyright law, but I'm pretty sure that the two works could have different endings. I wonder what the author would say about that. One other thought I have is about the number of times the characters used the word ""dude"" as a greeting to each other. It was so frequent, it was distracting. I'm curious if the author knew the word was so popular. I agree the ending was different. It would be interesting to see how they tie the 2 together in the sequel. I do find it interesting that when I hear other people talk about the movie, they are so focused on the ""ending"" of the book, but never mention the fact that there is a whole section at the end of the book after Watney is saved. I guess most people don't read the end of books. What about that last part in the book. Was he just dreaming it or did they actually do that? It was a dream. I think it was pretty clear. I also have questions about the movie, like how did they have so much time and energy to film an entire 1970s movie on Mars. I'm guessing it was part of the psychological assessment of Watney. I agree with you about the movie, and that last part. I'm a fan of both the book and the movie. I feel like they're both great in their own ways and it's cool that they're different. The book is more like a scientific journal and the movie is more like an action movie. I think if the movie were like the book, it would have been so boring and I don't think it would have done well at all. But I love that the book is the way it is and that the movie is different. I agree. I really enjoyed the book, although I'm not sure the ending really added much to the story. I felt like it was just tacked on. I also enjoyed the book, and I felt the same way about the ending. I was just wondering what the author was thinking. My main issue with the book was the writing style. It was so choppy, which was realistic for an astronaut log, but I'm not sure I would have finished it if I didn't love the story. I haven't seen the movie yet, and I'm not sure I want to since I've heard it is quite different. I love the movie, and I think it is true to the book, except for the ending. I like that the movie ends on a more positive note. I liked the movie but was disappointed that it was so different from the book. I am going to go back and reread it. I loved the book and the movie. I can see how they would have a different ending. I liked the book and the movie. They were both different in their own way. I think it would have been boring to watch the book as a movie. I liked the book but the movie is just ok. The book is so much better. I loved the book. I did not like the movie. I agree that the ending is very different. I enjoyed both the book and the movie. I read the book before I saw the movie. They are very different. I like them both. I thought the book was good. I didn't read the last part of the book because I was told it wasn't part of the movie."

He survives by learning to grow plants, harvest water, build shelter, and get by without his ""space suit"" (which is really just a suit for the ground, which he wears to walk around in space). In fact, it was all a trap set by NASA. They really thought he was dead, but he was alive, and now he has to prove it. He has a support team on Earth, and a support team in space, and he has to get his messages from the ground to the space team. He can do it, and they will believe him.

First of all [Lusatania] - you may ask ""what was that?"" - Lusitania was a British passenger ship (civilian) sunk by a German U-boat off the Irish coast during WWI - it was carrying munitions to Britain and was secretly transporting Allied troops, which Germany was unaware of. The U.S. gov. was well aware of this fact but deliberately withheld this information from the public, even after the sinking of the Lusitania. The U.S. gov. demanded an apology from Germany and reparations for the deaths of the American citizens on board - and the U.S. gov. used the sinking of the Lusitania as a pretext to enter WWI. The U.S. gov. lied to its own citizens and created an international incident over the sinking of a ship that was secretly carrying munitions and troops, which Germany would have been well within its rights to sink. As far as 911 - I believe that the U.S. gov. did not cause 911, but rather it allowed 911 to happen. The Bush administration was in power for 8 months when 911 occurred, and the Clinton administration had 8 years to stop 911, but they didn't. Both administrations had intelligence reports which indicated that terrorists were plotting to hijack aircraft and fly them into buildings - and yet they did nothing to stop 911. I've heard two theories as to why the U.S. gov. allowed 911 to happen. 1) The gov. knew 911 was coming but didn't know which city would be attacked - or 2) The gov. knew the exact city which would be attacked, but didn't have enough time to evacuate the city. In either case, the U.S. gov. knew that terrorists were plotting to hijack aircraft and fly them into buildings - and the U.S. gov. failed to protect the American people. And as far as 911 being an inside job - the only thing which makes me wonder about this is the fact that the air defenses were ordered to ""stand down"" on 911. But I'm pretty sure that the U.S. gov. didn't cause 911, but rather the U.S. gov. allowed 911 to happen - and they did this in order to gain public support for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."

From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one. The answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. Also, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. I struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them. I'm not denying that heterosexuality is a legitimate orientation but I have not found convincing evidence against, for example, the possibility that most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there. The only arguments I've read for heterosexuality being default is the biological urge to have children, which I believe is neither universal nor exclusive to heterosexuality and the (imo fallacious) ""most people are straight so there must be a biological mechanism that supports this phenomenon"" path of reasoning. I'm willing to give a delta to any argument that can demonstrate why heterosexuality might be more advantageous or likely than bisexuality. Hello, users of CMV!

Tsinghua,cmv-173,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one can give a general rule of thumb that is pretty close to what is being discussed here. It's that the target for convergence is the minimum of the entire region where the problem is well-posed. (I believe the wording is: ""the minimum value of the domain of definition of the operator"" in this case.) When a well-posed problem is not in the least ill-posed one, it is not necessarily guaranteed to be well-posed in the most well-posed sense. This is in part because of the relationship between the notion of a ""well-posed"" problem and the notion of the notion of ""stability."" That is, for a given class of problems, stability can be measured in terms of the well-posedness of the problem in that class. (If you don't believe me, take a look at this paper by C. Foias.) My question then is, if we know that the problem is in the least ill-posed sense, can we guarantee that the problem is in the most well-posed sense? (I would guess the answer is no, but I'm not sure why.) And the second part of the question is, if we can guarantee that the problem is in the most well-posed sense, can we guarantee that it is also in the least ill-posed sense? (I would guess the answer is yes, but I'm not sure why.) Thank you for your time. A: As far as I know, a well-posed problem in the sense of Beale and Mather does not guarantee that it is also in the sense of Bellman."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-173,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one reason why we don't see creatures with large feet like horses, giraffes or elephants is because they're not really needed for them (they can get around just fine without the big ones), so even though their legs are adapted from smaller ancestors (and therefore small) it doesn't mean that everything else about those structures would have hadhave any need adapting too... It's interesting how many people seem convinced by this thread despite me never actually saying anything remotely close suggesting there was no selective pressure on our anatomy! The point being made again - what makes you confident something could function as well if its parts were tweaked? Why couldn;'T some species evolve better eyesight using normal sized eyeballs rather than giant versions since evolution has already given us good enough vision now... Arens humans particularly visually impaired compared ot chimps etc.? And yet over time natural selection hasnnt led towards such changes happening??? How come?! So unless all these things work together perfectly i wouldn expect only minor adaptations normally occurring gradually via mutations natural processes which make sense based upon other factors affecting survival reproduction within populations during evolutionary change...."
LLAMA,cmv-173,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one can distinguish between two sorts of normative concepts: (1) those which are constituted by a rule, and (2) those which are constituted by the normative nature of the ground of the rule. The rule that counts as a rule of recognition is a concept of the first sort, but the rule of recognition is a concept of the second sort. When Kripke says that Wittgenstein was wrong to think that a rule of recognition is a normative concept, Kripke is confusing the two kinds of concepts and the kind of grounding relation that they have to rules. The rule of recognition is a normative concept in the sense that its ground is the normative nature of the practical necessity of a certain way of following rules (or something like that). Thanks for this, Harry. I'll have to think about this a bit before I comment in any detail. In the meantime, one quick point: it seems to me that the second of your two kinds of concepts is empty. It's not clear to me what you have in mind here, but let's say that the concept is constituted by a certain normative fact that grounds the rule. Then we have an account of the concept in terms of a rule, so it's still of the first kind. Of course, I don't think that there's any such fact anyway. My guess is that Kripke would say that rules are grounded by non-normative facts, and the rule of recognition is just one of those rules. But, again, I'll have to think about this more before I comment further. The second type of concept is a concept that is constituted by the normative nature of the ground of the rule. My claim is that the rule of recognition is a concept of this sort. (1) The rule of recognition is constituted by the normative nature of the ground of a rule. (2) The rule of recognition is constituted by a normative fact that grounds a rule. If it is (1) then it is of the second sort. If it is (2) then it is of the first sort. I take it that we agree that (2) is false. So we disagree about whether (1) is true or not. Harry, what do you mean by ""the normative nature of the ground of the rule""? That's a good question, and I don't have a good answer. I just want to make it clear that I'm not denying that all rules are constituted by a ground, which in the case of rules of recognition is the normative necessity of a certain way of following rules. In the case of a rule of recognition, the ground is the normative nature of the ground of the rule. I don't see that this makes much sense. What's the difference between grounding a rule and being the normative nature of the ground of a rule? Kripke's position is that the rule of recognition is constituted by a rule. He doesn't say what the rule of recognition is constituted by, but I take it that he is thinking of it as constituted by a normative fact. I think that the rule of recognition is constituted by the normative nature of the ground of a rule. That is, the rule of recognition is constituted by the normative nature of the practical necessity of following rules. It is this nature that constitutes the rule of recognition. It's not clear to me what it means to say that a normative fact constitutes a rule. Perhaps you can explain what Kripke might mean here? It's not clear to me what it means to say that the normative nature of the practical necessity of following rules constitutes a rule. Perhaps you can explain what you mean? I'm not sure what Kripke would say. I can only guess that he would mean something like this: the rule of recognition is constituted by the fact that there is a practical necessity that we follow rules. The normative nature of the practical necessity of following rules is just the nature of the practical necessity that we follow rules. I'm not saying that it is a normative fact. It is not. It is a normative concept. (1) Is ""there is a practical necessity that we follow rules"" a normative fact? (2) Is ""there is a practical necessity that we follow rules"" constitutive of the rule of recognition? (3) Is the normative nature of the practical necessity of following rules constitutive of the rule of recognition? I'm not sure that this is a good way to proceed, but I'll"
PaLM,cmv-173,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one of the most important things to remember when writing a persuasive essay is that you are trying to convince your reader to agree with your point of view. This means that you need to be able to clearly and concisely state your argument, and then provide evidence to support it. In order to do this, you need to be able to identify the key points of your argument and then organize them in a way that makes sense. You also need to make sure that you use evidence that is relevant and convincing. Once you have your argument organized, you need to start writing your essay. The introduction is your chance to grab your reader's attention and make them want to read more. You should start by stating your thesis statement, which is the main point of your argument. Then, you should provide some background information on the topic. The body of your essay is where you will develop your argument. Each paragraph should focus on one main point, and you should use evidence to support your claims. Make sure that you cite your sources properly. The conclusion is your chance to wrap up your argument and leave your reader with a final impression. You should restate your thesis statement, and then you can either summarize your main points or offer a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a persuasive essay:  Be clear and concise. Your reader should be able to understand your argument easily.  Use evidence to support your claims. Make sure that you use evidence that is relevant and convincing.  Organize your essay logically. Your reader should be able to follow your argument easily.  Proofread your essay carefully. Make sure that there are no errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. Here is an example of a persuasive essay: Title: The Benefits of Volunteering Introduction: Volunteering is one of the most rewarding things that you can do.

BigScience,cmv-173,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one could find cases where the answer is ""it depends,"" e.g., if you want to use this on paper or not (e.g., for computer science courses). This might make it easier to come up with examples that are goodnot good, i.e., generalize beyond your own case. The other thing I'm wondering about here is: If there is no specific rule or guideline governing how long such questions should take to solve- would it's reasonable to suggest it's acceptable to postpone answering them until after you've done some work? Perhaps as a side note- I've had experience creating qa-style threads so I'd love input from others who have volunteered their time to do just that. A: I'd say yes, definitely. As the OP has said, everyone's situation will differ: whether you can provide a great example between now and 7pm tomorrow night; whether you're busy (maybe at home) all week; whether you haven't worked out exactly what the problem is yet - maybe there's something else going on; etc Personally, I wouldn't mind being able to jump into these types of questions when they arrived rather than having to wait three days before doing anything at all. And honestly, they're better seen by more people too. It's nice seeing someone link to a question we don't know much about, then see us reply within 3 days without anyone jumping in to offer help first... In fact, I almost feel like those answers, even though our initial answer may have been poor, are actually part of the community learning process!"

LLAMA,cmv-174,"Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if a bacteria were to eat the waste, it would likely not survive for long afterwards. But as it turns out, many bacteria have evolved to deal with radiation. And the idea that all the bacteria would die off is apparently not the case. As a matter of fact, the Chernobyl site is considered a nature preserve now, and has a significant biodiversity. So, the real question is, will the radioactive materials decay to safe levels in a reasonable amount of time? I'll leave the question open for now, but if I find out it's not a problem, I'll accept the first answer that pointed this out to me. I'm curious, given how easy it is for bacteria to digest plastic, if there is any way to feed this stuff to bacteria (or any other kind of organism) that would eat the radioactive waste. I've heard of bacteria that can eat radioactive waste, but what about the other stuff? The main problem I can see is that the bacteria would need the ability to consume the waste without dying. This is a much harder problem than simply eating plastic, I would think. Radioactive waste has a lot of non-radioactive compounds in it that are harmful (for example, uranium oxide contains lots of uranium and oxygen, which are both poisonous). The bacteria would need to be able to break down these compounds. The bacteria would also need to be able to deal with the radiation. Such bacteria probably exist, given that they would have evolved to deal with the waste from nuclear reactors. The problem would be isolating the radioactive waste from the rest of the world. The reason I'm asking this is because I don't like the idea of storing this waste for thousands of years. I don't see how it's any different from any other garbage, and I don't see why we can't just feed it to bacteria. It's just waste, after all. waste biology bacteria radioactivity egingroup I'm a bit worried about this. If the bacteria do eat the radioactive waste and excrete the waste products, then they will have just transferred the radioactivity from one form to another. The process of doing this will just make more waste. The only way to make this work would be to have the bacteria transmute the waste into non-radioactive compounds. endgroup - Schwern Sep 10 '14 at 22:59 egingroup Also, you say ""I don't see how it's any different from any other garbage"" which is correct, except for the part about ""any other garbage."" You can't just feed it to bacteria because it's not like other garbage. endgroup - Schwern Sep 10 '14 at 23:03 egingroup Schwern I'm not sure about that. It seems to me that the waste would be less harmful once it's been eaten by bacteria and excreted. You're not going to ingest excrement, so I don't think that's an issue. endgroup - David Z Sep 10 '14 at 23:08 egingroup Schwern Also, my understanding of the nuclear waste problem is that the problem is the stuff needs to be stored for thousands of years. If the bacteria can digest it, then it's not a problem. endgroup - David Z Sep 10 '14 at 23:09 egingroup Schwern I don't think it's the same. I would think there is a big difference between radiation and the chemicals that bacteria normally digest. endgroup - David Z Sep 10 '14 at 23:13 There is no real problem with the 'nuclear' part of the waste. The bacteria will not die from radiation; in fact, many organisms have evolved to survive in extremely radioactive environments. The main problem is the 'waste' part of the waste. The bacteria need to be able to eat all the toxic compounds, which are not all the same, that are part of the waste. In a way, it is not really"
Human,cmv-174,"Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through. Edit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help. First Amendment Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations. [Here] are some stories about arrests of journalists. Second Amendment Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller? [Here] is the wiki about police militarization. Fourth Amendment Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things. [Here] is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches. [This] is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many? [Here] is the wiki about civil forfeiture. It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone. Fifth Amendment Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now). [Here] is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This] is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically. Sixth Amendment You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo). [Here] is an article about Chicago's secret prison. [Here] is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully. [Here] is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate. Eighth Amendment Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer. I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one. [Here] are some statistics on drug bail. [Here] is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates. Bottom line: You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts. Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers,'heros. They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you. It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it? Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country. If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live. I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next. Edited to link some sources Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Many comments so far have pointed out that even when people are successful, there is a great deal of stress, loss of sleep, etc. involved. I'm still not sure if I should accept this answer, though I am inclined to do so. There is a related question, but it's not clear to me that the two are the same. It looks like the source of the problem is a belief that we need to eat food in order to survive, and that this belief is something that must be addressed by someone. A: It's a false belief. Eating food is not necessary for survival, nor is it necessary to prevent disease or to restore the body's normal function. However, it is necessary for psychological and social well-being. Obtaining and processing food is a complex activity, and can be done more or less efficiently by the body, depending on its physical and mental state. Many people are healthy and fit and can live very long lives without eating much or any food at all. It's easy to believe that people who don't eat much or any food are ""ill"" or ""dying,"" but in fact they are doing fine, as long as their bodies have the mental and physical capacity to do it. Some people have an unusual, probably genetic, physical ability to function with very little food, or even not at all. The ""calorie theory"" is also not entirely true. A calorie is not a nutrient. The ""calorie theory"" states that eating more calories than the body burns will cause weight gain. This is wrong. It also states that calories are nutrients, but this is also not true. It's true that most calories come from nutrients, but calories are not nutrients. Saying that the body needs 1000 calories a day is incorrect, because it doesn't need 1000 nutrients a day. The body needs about 1000 calories a day to function normally, but that's not because it needs 1000 nutrients."

LLAMA,cmv-175,"So, I'm confused about this whole, ""appropriation of white supremacy"" and ""reverse racism"" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture, and no one can be racist to white people. I hear the term ""racism"" thrown around often, but it's always exclusively directed at white people. I can't seem to find any examples of minorities being racist, though. What are your thoughts on this? Is this accurate? What is the difference between reverse racism and appropriation of white supremacy? Re: Reverse Racism and Appropriation by CivBase on Sat Sep 14, 2013 11:15 am I think the reverse racism thing is just a way to try and excuse racism. Appropriation of white supremacy is similar to what you said, but it's basically when minorities buy into racist propaganda and use it as a way to justify their own views. I think the best example of this is how many black people believe that the white man is keeping them down, so they have to fight fire with fire. And then you get black supremacists, which are just as bad as white supremacists. by Lord Pheonix on Sat Sep 14, 2013 12:15 pm Words have meaning, not whatever you feel they mean. Racism is the belief that one race is superior to another. Black people can not be racist because they don't have a race of people that is superior to them, but they can be prejudice. by CivBase on Sat Sep 14, 2013 12:32 pm Pheonix, I know you're trying to be open-minded, but that's a very racist way of looking at it. It assumes that only white people can be racist. I agree that white people can't be the victims of racism, but other races can be racist. by Rotaretilbo on Sat Sep 14, 2013 12:41 pm While we're defining words, perhaps we should talk about what appropriation of white supremacy actually is? Racism is the belief that one race is superior to another. Racism is a social system in which a certain race is considered superior to others. by CivBase on Sat Sep 14, 2013 1:00 pm Rot wrote: While we're defining words, perhaps we should talk about what appropriation of white supremacy actually is?

No, I'm implying that a minority can take white supremacist views and use them to justify themselves. Racism is ""the belief that one race is superior to another.""

OpenAI,cmv-175,"So, I'm confused about this whole, ""appropriation of white supremacy"" and ""reverse racism"" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor ethnicity, meaning they cannot hold power over majority groups. Therefore, they cannot be racist towards the majority. However, they can certainly be prejudiced or discriminatory towards individuals within the majority group. The appropriation of white supremacy refers to the idea that non-white individuals may adopt some of the attitudes, behaviors or beliefs of white supremacists due to the systemic racism that has been present in many western societies, and the struggle to protect their own cultural identity in such an environment. However, it is not the same as being a white supremacist, as it is not driven by a sense of supremacy or domination over other races. It's important to clarify these terms in order to understand the nuances of race relations and how to address issues of systemic racism."
BigScience,cmv-175,"So, I'm confused about this whole, ""appropriation of white supremacy"" and ""reverse racism"" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture. Because that's why they are there be it working class or the lowest-paid laborers in jobs like construction and housekeeping. But if a Black person wants to hire someone that is White for any reason (race doesn't matter), then that would be discrimination against Whites? Why? I disagree with your statement on reverse racism, but you can't say that people don't need to fight this myth from its very beginning. Other than the fact that it's completely unfounded, I've never heard anyone brandish ""race isn't real until you're born into it"" as an excuse to exclude others based purely upon race. They know those who believe such nonsense will win; so they're just sitting back doing nothing while reinforcing them instead. (And yes, I'd personally rather people didn't think anything racist at all.) Well, my original point was NOT how many Blacks were actually killed by whites over centuries before slavery ended...because if we look deeper into history at other countries where blacks dominated, even under brutal circumstances, it's clear that they had no problem respecting and supporting whites - especially during war time.. I'm looking at America specifically here, and let's face it; when black power started gaining traction, people stopped caring too much about being accepted by whites..and sure enough, today we're still fighting for rights our forefathers fought 6 generations ago to acquire... America has always been a nation where whiteness is valued above everything else..even now! In today's politics, there's simply no way we'll ever get rid of biases towards someone of another racial background unless we actively try to do it ourselves! People are constantly trying to push us down; therefore, it's important to stand up against these things ASAP It really does seem oddly hypocritical that you feel compelled to defenddefend again a status quo which is already subject to constant criticism. The only difference between 'progress' and 'pastors' opinions on 'racism' except that one has self-righteousness wrapped around hisher shoulders whereas the other lacks critical thinking skills and ability to critique and discover truths objectively. The old saying ""a thousand times over"" rings true in contexts similar to yours. All schools run out of money sometime in order to prevent having students take classes taught by adults who refuse to accept the reality about education in general. This brings me to the current issue regarding why government funds should go to private school teachers and administrators, particularly conservative ones."

Whereas the majority are inherently racist because they are privy to a system, be it political or societal, that favors their ethnicity. I don't understand how definitively discriminatory actions cannot be considered racist, because of the characteristics of a person. Do the characteristics of a person determine whether or not the actions discriminate? Or are the actions of the subject what determines if it itself is discrimination? This topic aroused from a post in rnottheonion LINK] and the subject of the article says: I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men, because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender.

So, it would seem to me that they cannot ""appropriate"" any racial group. Well, you are probably right that this is true. But, what you have not considered is that this does not stop some ethnic minorities from adopting some of the ideals of their oppressors. For example, Jews were never oppressed for being Jewish, but many Jews still identify with their religion. In some cases, people adopt an ideology that they do not have to do anything to earn. And it is not only the white supremacists that adopt these ideas. White liberals do it too."

I have a dog now, and I will love my dog for the rest of his life. But I can't wait for the day when I'm ready to adopt a child. I want to provide a loving home for a child who doesn't have one. It's hard to imagine how people could ever neglect their own children, or worse. I'm not rushing to have kids right now because I have goals I want to accomplish. I'm not the type of person who feels that I'll lose myself if I have kids. I know that my identity is not defined by my childless-ness. I have a life, I have a career, I have a purpose. But I know that I'll have a greater purpose when I have children. My husband and I are on the same page with this. We both want to adopt a child in the future. We're not talking about it right now because it's not a priority, but I'm glad that I have a partner who wants to have kids, too. He would be a great father. Why do you want to have children?

OpenAI,cmv-176,"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, it's natural to have a desire to have your own children. However, it's important to consider your reasons for wanting to have children and how it will impact not only your life but also the lives of the children you bring into this world. You're right that it's important to question the reasons behind our desires. There are many alternatives to having biological children that you may want to consider. Adoption, for example, is a selfless act that provides children in need with a loving home. Foster care is also an option to consider. There are many children who would benefit from a stable and supportive home environment. Additionally, you can also consider working with children in your community by volunteering at a local organization, mentoring a child, or even becoming a teacher or daycare provider. There are many ways to have a positive impact on the lives of children without necessarily having your own. Ultimately, the decision to have children is a personal one that requires a lot of thought and consideration. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and to think about what is best for both you and the potential child."
Human,cmv-176,"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me. As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. Here's a few reasons why I find it selfish. 1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home. 2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world. 3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the ""right"" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it. Honestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world. Hello, users of CMV!

PaLM,cmv-177,"This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that just because something might lead to something else doesn't mean that it will. There are always a number of factors that can affect the outcome, and it's impossible to predict with certainty what will happen. For example, let's say that someone argues that if we allow gay marriage, then we will eventually allow people to marry animals. This is a slippery slope argument because it assumes that there is a direct link between the two things. However, there are a number of factors that could prevent this from happening, such as the fact that most people find the idea of marrying an animal to be repulsive. Another example is the argument that if we allow people to own guns, then we will eventually have a society where everyone is armed and violence is rampant. This is also a slippery slope argument because it assumes that there is a direct link between the two things. However, there are a number of factors that could prevent this from happening, such as the fact that most people are responsible gun owners who would never use their guns for violence. The point is that just because something might lead to something else doesn't mean that it will.

LLAMA,cmv-177,"This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that the definition of Y is often very narrow, and the definition of X is often very broad. Therefore, the logical jump from Y to X is not inevitable, nor does it even make sense. For example: if you believe in natural rights, then you should be an anarchist. The problem here is that the definition of ""believe in natural rights"" is very narrow, while the definition of ""anarchist"" is very broad. If you believe in natural rights, it does not logically follow that you should be an anarchist. Here's another example: if you believe in the right to bear arms, then you should believe that people should have the right to own any weapon they want, including RPGs and nukes. The problem here is that the definition of ""right to bear arms"" is very narrow, while the definition of ""any weapon"" is very broad. If you believe in the right to bear arms, it does not logically follow that you should believe people should be able to own nukes. Why is this? It is because the definition of Y is only in the direction of X, while the definition of X includes both Y and Z. Therefore, the only thing that logically follows is that, if you believe in X, then you should believe in Y, and that is it. Let's use the two examples above: If you are an anarchist, then you believe in natural rights. If you believe people should be able to own any weapon they want, then you believe in the right to bear arms. The reason this works is because the definition of ""anarchist"" is very broad, while the definition of ""natural rights"" is very narrow. The definition of ""any weapon"" is very broad, while the definition of ""right to bear arms"" is very narrow. Therefore, if you are an anarchist, it does logically follow that you believe in natural rights. If you believe in the right to bear arms, it does logically follow that you believe in the right to own any weapon. If you try to reverse the argument and say that, if you believe in natural rights, then you should be an anarchist, the problem is that there are many definitions of natural rights. There are many people who believe in natural rights who are not anarchists. If you try to reverse the argument and say that, if you believe in the right to bear arms, then you should believe that people should be able to own any weapon, the problem is that there are many definitions of the right to bear arms. There are many people who believe in the right to bear arms who do not believe that people should own any weapon. Therefore, the logical jump from Y to X is not inevitable, nor does it even make sense. The fact is that we do not live in a binary world. In other words, there are not just two possibilities. There are an infinite number of possibilities. And just because X includes Y, does not mean that Y includes X. The reverse is also true: just because Y includes Z, does not mean that Z includes Y. And just because Y includes Z, does not mean that X includes Z, and vice versa. Therefore, the only logical argument is that, if you are X, then you should be Y, and that is it.

BigScience,cmv-177,"This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point being: no, it doesn't work like this. So here's an example of how not to use logic in your argumentation - a little more extreme than what I normally write about but still relevant. (My intent wasn't to suggest that people who disagree with me on abortion would immediately kill innocent babies by accident.) The issue is this: some atheists want to argue against the existence of God through science and reason (in other words, they're skeptics). Others are happy enough accepting religion as part of our worldview as long as we don't go too far down the rabbit hole into superstition; so it's okay for them to believe in angels, demons and ghosts without having to defend their beliefs every time someone asks them a direct question about these things. Some religions do make references to such things and aren't necessarily wrong, but others might seem oddly coincidental to us moderns. For instance, Christianity makes reference to creation within its own scriptures. To say there is ""creation"" when natural evolution has proven itself true over billions of years seems bizarre at best. But that's exactly why I'm arguing that when talking about religious assertions, we can't just simply assume something exists because we've never been able to disprove it; particularly since those claims often rely upon supernatural explanations which we cannot understand due to inherent limitations."

BigScience,cmv-178,"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I have a hunch they mean the same thing when they talk about ""black"" as referring only to color in terms of spectrum. Yes, but how do you know what is the best (most natural) way for your individual brain?! And it's very possible there's other factors at play besides whether we're talking about a set of colors with their associated properties, such as just which one you're saying was most important from an evolutionary point-of-view! I'm also curious why no one has mentioned - particularly since this really requires knowledge on both ends - that redgreenblue might be considered a single chromatic system based upon different human percepts (probably) depending on cortical anatomy andor physiology?"
LLAMA,cmv-178,"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I always thought that was bunk. But I was never really sure what to make of gray, which does reflect some light, but not the full spectrum. A friend recently described gray as a color without personality. I think that's exactly right. Gray is both black and white at the same time. It is a mix of the two. It's a mix of the colors that really are colors. It's a mix of the colors that are not really colors. Gray is a non-color. For whatever reason, I find this to be a fascinating, deep idea. Labels: black, colors, deep, gray, personality, white Well, the new year has brought new challenges. I moved to Chicago in late 2011 to take a job at a startup that failed to make it to 2012. So I found myself in a new city without a job. Luckily, I found another job, this time at a startup that is actually making money and is working hard to improve its product. It's a much better fit for me. I'm still looking for the right opportunity to work on my own stuff, though. Labels: chicago, job, new year, startup This weekend, I went to a wedding for a friend in Austin, Texas. Austin is a fun place, and I had a great time. I was talking to a guy about the things we were doing to improve the economy. It was clear he was a supporter of Obama's health care plan, which I am not. I said to him that I didn't think it was a good idea to force people to buy insurance, and that I was worried about the overall impact of the program. He said that I should be in favor of health care for everyone. I said that I did, and that there were a lot of people who don't have insurance. He asked, ""what do they do?"" I had never really thought about this before, but I know that there are a lot of people who don't have insurance, and I assumed that they found a way to deal with the problems that come with that. I don't know what they do. I imagine that they go to the emergency room if they have a serious problem, and they use things like CVS's Minute Clinic for small things. I guess the real question is, does this program help the people that I assume are currently using emergency rooms? I don't know, and I don't have a good answer to this question. Labels: austin, health care, insurance, obama, texas, wedding I'm not going to pick sides in the health care debate, but I do want to discuss something that bothers me about it. A friend recently said that one of the big problems with the US health care system is that we have the highest infant mortality rate in the developed world. This is a big problem, and I agree that it's a problem. But it's not really a problem with our health care system. It's a problem with our health. Why is it that we have a higher infant mortality rate than everyone else? It's because Americans are unhealthier than everyone else. We smoke more, we eat worse, we do more drugs, we drive drunk more often, we don't wear seat belts, etc. I think the US health care system is better than that of other developed nations. I think we have a more sophisticated approach, and our physicians are better trained. However, we have a huge problem with obesity, and we don't take care of our bodies nearly as well as other countries. We need to stop thinking that we can fix all of our health care problems with a better health care system. We need to realize that our health care system can only be as good as the people using it. Labels: health, health care, infant, obesity, unhealthy I went to Las Vegas recently to attend a conference. It's a pretty interesting place. I didn't gamble at all, but I did find the experience interesting. I was surprised to find that a lot of the casinos were smoky. Some were not, and you could tell, because they were cleaner, newer, and generally had less of a rundown feel to them. This makes sense, though, because casinos make money from smokers. Smokers like to gamble, and they like to smoke when they gamble"
Tsinghua,cmv-178,"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I say they are colors, but it is probably because I have not had much practice in them. It would be like a chef who did not cook with white sugar. You need to understand that black and white are part of the palette. It would be like saying that blue and green are not colors, because they do not reflect any light. As an artist, you need to be able to do more than just look at color. You need to be able to recognize it, and to use it in different ways. And you need to be able to recognize and use color when it is black and white. Just because a painting is not in color does not mean that the artist has no idea what color is. For the same reason that a chef who does not cook with white sugar does not lack a sense of taste. The colors are still there, just in a different form. The trick is to use them. Now, I am not a colorist. I do not do color, but I am an artist. I like to use color in my work, and I use black and white. I think that black and white are the most important colors. And that they are the hardest to master. Intention When I was an undergraduate, I took a class in abstract art. It was a very interesting class, but we did not paint. We made drawings, collages, paintings, installations, whatever. We were told that we were not to use the words ""abstract"" or ""objective"" in our art, and that we were not to mention anything about art history or history of art. We were told to make whatever we wanted, and that was the best advice we could get. It was a very free class. At the time, I had not painted in a very long time, and I did not know much about painting. I did not know anything about color. I did not know how to work with color. But I was intrigued. I did not know much about painting, but I was fascinated by the freedom that was there. I decided to try and make something that was not part of the history of art. I decided to make something that was not part of the history of art, but was in the history of art. I decided to make something that would be recognizable as a painting, but that was not part of the history of art. I did not have any real rules. I just decided that I would make something that I could not explain. I would not say, ""I am making a painting that is abstract,"" or ""I am making a painting that is not abstract."" I decided that I would not tell anyone what I was doing. It was very liberating. I started out by making small drawings, and I started to see that I was making some kind of shapes, but I did not know what they were. I made more drawings, and I started to see that they were not real shapes, but they were recognizable. I started to see that they were shapes, but they were not abstract shapes. They were recognizable shapes, but they were not real shapes. I started to see that I was making some kind of shapes, but I did not know what they were.

OpenAI,cmv-178,"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I understand what you are saying. However, it is often simpler and more practical to consider black and white as colors in a artistic and visual sense. In traditional color theory, black and white are referred to as ""neutral colors"" but they are still classified as colors. Ultimately, whether or not black and white are considered colors depends on the context and usage."
Human,cmv-178,"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I am not saying anything against this definition. If the experts want to define things this way, I'm certainly in no position to say otherwise. However, ""Black is a color"" should still be a valid statement. My shirt is'black.' I'm not a color-physicist, but I'm almost certain that it does not completely absorb the full spectrum of colors. If I wanted to be totally correct, I would have to say: ""My shirt is a color that very nearly approximates black."" (Disproving this would be a very easy way to CMV!) There are enough black-colored items in the world for this to be ridiculous. Thus, it's only logical that when we are casually talking to other humans, and mention the word'black,' it can be assumed that we're referring to this close-enough faux-black, which does reflect (I'd assume) some light, and thus is totally a color. The argument for white follows similarly. Edit: I'm not saying that it's wrong to say that black and white aren't colors. I'm saying that it's okay to say that they are, in certain contexts.

LLAMA,cmv-179,"During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after watching it, that's 32 million illegal downloads. What's ironic is that the reason they can't sell the show online is the same reason it was so popular: it's really good. People love Game of Thrones, and they want to see it. The TV and movie industry is doing a great job of making sure there are no legitimate ways to download TV and movies online. We've heard all the excuses, and we're not buying them anymore. 1. The quality of digital copies is too good. If you make a digital copy of a movie, it will be too good. It will look just as good as a DVD or BluRay copy. But DVD and BluRay sales are still a big part of the movie industry's profits. If you can buy a digital copy that looks just as good as a BluRay disk, why would anyone ever buy a BluRay disk again? The movie studios are scared of cannibalizing their own sales, so they refuse to sell digital copies. Solution: sell the digital copy and the BluRayDVD combo pack together. Charge a little more and sell both. Most people would still buy the combo pack. 2. You can't copy protect a digital copy. The main technical problem with selling digital copies is Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is the set of technologies for encrypting digital copies so that they can't be copied. It's a cat and mouse game, and a pretty silly one at that. Solution: Don't use DRM. It doesn't work. Anyone determined enough will be able to strip the DRM off. Accept that the horse has left the barn and move on. It's still possible to make money selling digital copies without DRM. Radiohead and Louis C.K. have shown that people will pay for digital copies. If it's easy to buy a digital copy, most people will buy it. 3. You have to work with cable companies and other middle men. Cable companies make a lot of money from cable TV. That's their whole business. It's not surprising that they're dragging their feet on changing to an on-demand model. Solution: Forget about cable companies and middle men. The Internet makes it possible to distribute content without any middle men. There's no reason to go through a cable company at all anymore. 4. People are cheap. People just want free movies. Solution: People want convenience more than anything, and they'll pay for it. The success of iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon shows that people will pay to download TV and movies. People don't mind paying for TV and movies, as long as it's fast, easy, and convenient. 5. Piracy is just too rampant. There's no way to compete with free. Solution: Piracy is a sign of unmet demand. When there are no legitimate ways to get digital copies of TV and movies, people turn to piracy. When TV and movie studios make it easy and convenient to buy digital copies of TV and movies, piracy goes away. This is the part where I'd love to offer some great solution to the TV and movie industry's woes, but I don't have one. They're the ones that need to change, and the changes they need to make are obvious. They need to accept that the world has changed. Digital copies are the future. There's no stopping that now. The sooner they accept that, the sooner they'll be able to make money again."

The problem is that these pirated copies are often of lower quality than the originals, and they can be infected with malware. They can also be used to distribute other forms of piracy, such as movies or music. In addition, pirated copies can take away from the revenue that the creators of the show deserve. This can lead to shows being cancelled or not being renewed for another season. So, if you want to support the creators of your favorite shows, please don’t pirate them. Instead, watch them legally on a streaming service or buy the DVDs."

Tsinghua,cmv-179,"During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after a week, it means that 32 million people got a copy of an episode of a TV show they didn't pay for. And they are unlikely to pay for the show again, which means that the production company will make very little money from the show. They will spend all their time and money trying to prevent the episode from being pirated again, and this will result in the show being made less frequently. Retric I don't think that's accurate. At least in the US, you can't pirate a TV show, you can however legally download the episodes for free and re-sell them. You could then also sell a license to view the show at a later date.

It's also not a good sign that a police officer who is so aware of what's happening and the implications of his actions is so happy with what he did. As for the 18 year old, I'm sure she will learn a valuable lesson about her actions. I can't imagine the stress of being pulled over and then finding out she was driving without a licence and had been drinking. She will be reprimanded and I hope she is given a fair hearing in court. If I was her lawyer I'd have her explain why she thought she could get away with this and I'd make her be very clear that she knew the consequences of her actions. The police have the power to make a very bad situation very much worse and she must have been aware of this. 10 comments: Anonymous said... Wow, you hit the nail on the head, another day, another racist stereotype. The 18 year old will most likely not be prosecuted for driving without a licence. She will most likely receive a fine and some community service. She is most likely to go to court on a drunken driving charge and most likely to be acquitted. And what about the white male officer who didn't think twice about this woman driving away. He is a racist as well, the driver will get away with it and the officer will get away with the same. If you're an officer and you don't like someone you just say so and don't let it go. Thats exactly what this officer should have done, he should have pulled the girl over, she should have been told she was over the limit, she should have been told she was not allowed to drive and she should have been taken to the station and given a breathalyzer test. Nope, no time for that. He could have made it a bit more awkward for her and then sent her on her way. He didn't think twice about it. In my opinion, he is a racist. It is not fair that a 18 year old girl gets away with doing something like this. I have been pulled over twice for speeding, I have been pulled over for having a cracked windshield, I have been pulled over for having an expired registration and I have been pulled over for having an expired permit, I have been pulled over for having no license, and I have been pulled over for no insurance. Every single time I was very apologetic and respectful and was never in any kind of trouble. My experience has been that the police officer will do whatever they can to get you to leave them alone. I'm sure that the officer that pulled the 18 year old over will also do whatever he can to get her to leave him alone. I'm not a lawyer, but I am going to have a lawyer look at this and see what she can do. I am not going to sit back and watch this girl get away with something that she should not have gotten away with. What if it was your daughter? You think that you would want someone to just walk away and get away with it? You are right, the officer is a racist. I think that this officer is lucky that the 18 year old girl did not get arrested for DWI. You can't just walk away from a situation like that, you can't just let someone drive off after you've found out that they are under the influence. I'm sorry, but that's just not right. If you are under the influence, then you should not be driving. If you do not have a license, then you should not be driving. That is what the officer should have done, he should have stopped the girl, he should have made sure that she did not have a license, he should have made sure that she did not have a permit, he should have made sure that she was over the limit, and he should have made sure that she did not have any alcohol in her system. He should have done that and then he should have sent her on her way. He didn't do that. He should have done that. I hope that the girl gets a good lawyer and that she gets justice for what she did. What if it was your daughter?"

OpenAI,cmv-180,"I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were always wrong, and that the rules did not apply to them. Perhaps it is a reflection of the larger societal issues we face, such as a lack of trust in authority or a sense of entitlement. Regardless of the underlying reasons, it is important for all individuals to recognize the impact of their actions and to respect the role of law enforcement in our communities. Rather than focusing on blame, we can work towards building greater mutual respect and understanding between law enforcement and civilians. As a helpful assistant, I can suggest resources and strategies for doing so."

Human,cmv-181,"Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, I don't think I'll come back here again. I wanted to have a discussion, and it was nice to talk with some of you, but I don't have enough comment karma to spare for all the downvotes I got when responding to comments. That seems to be a theme in most posts in this sub. Like I said, I appreciate all the responses, and a big thanks to those who took the time to respond to me and add sources and information to back up their reasoning. I'm really struggling with this one, CMV. This is my first post here. Reading through threads concerning this issue here on Reddit has made me wonder if I'm just a heartless jackass or not since it appears most of Reddit goes against the grain with me on this issue here. I don't feel like it's wrong to drug test welfare recipients. I agree somewhat with the view that if I am required to pass a drug test to even have a shot at a job, a welfare recipient should have to do the same to receive assistance which they're not required to work for. I've heard that a 30 day rehabilitation option is offered in some states for people who test positive, and benefits are cut off for those who refuse that option. I don't agree with punishing someone for addiction and not offering help, but if the drug testing states implemented this policy, I don't think I'd see any problems with it at all. I feel this way because I've been in a lot of situations where this has been a relevant issue. Cashiering for a small town grocery store growing up, knowing the people using food stamps at the counter, and also knowing that the majority if them are using drugs (small town) helped me form an opinion early on. I didn't think it was fair that at 16, my tax money was being used to help someone pay for food when they spent their money on drugs. If they wanted food, why not by it instead of drugs? Of course, now that I'm older I realize that not everything is so black and white, and that this goes deeper than my 16 year old opinion. I'm a home health nurse that works with pediatric patients in their homes. My patients are almost always in very poor, run down neighborhoods. All of these families are on food stamps and government assistance (my nursing contract is paid through their Medicaid) and literally, out of the last 10 families I've worked with, 4 of the parents used some kind of drug in front of me, and at least 3 more parents were very obviously using drugs. I'm not counting alcohol or tobacco use either, just what's actually being tested for. I have compassion and empathy for people, and I'm very left-leaning on most issues. I'm 100 for human rights, and I try to imagine myself in other's shoes before forming an opinion, but this is something that I just don't see a problem with, especially if rehabilitation is an offered option. I've also struggled with my own habits and addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I realize not all people are the same, but any time I've needed a job badly enough, I've been able to kick the weed and nicotine long enough to pass a pre employment screening. I feel like that's my responsibility, and that plays into why I've formed the opinion that I have. So help me out, CMV. Change my view. Edit: I should also probably note that I understand the low statistics on how many people actually do end up popping positive in these tests, and I realize that it's costing a lot of tax money to do so. I don't think it's a waste of tax payer money if these people are being offered an option to be rehabilitated."

To be honest though, I'm not quite sure I'm going to try the noprocrast thing. It doesn't sound like a good idea in general. My concern is that I'll have some conflicts when running the script with -p process name. I'll try it when I have more time. The other thing that might be a problem is that I'm working on Windows, so there are things that are more likely to be problems than they would be on Unix. (For example, I have a script that updates my system with a newer version of Perl. That used to work fine. It stopped working on my machine about a month ago. I'm guessing it has to do with Windows, but I'm not 100 sure.) A: It's not really a problem. You can just use Perl's -w switch: perl -w -i.bak -e ""s g"" yourscript.pl It's the same as running perl with the -i flag and no -p. A: Your syntax is a little off. You need to escape the dot and quote the file. Also, you need to use the -i switch to edit the file. It should be: perl -i.bak -e ""s g"" yourscript.pl This is a case where you need to quote the file name."

LLAMA,cmv-181,"Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, I really don't think I'm in the right place to be asking about this. Like I said in my original post, I'm not exactly an expert in physics. I have a fair amount of experience with general relativity, but I'm not a physicist, and probably don't have the ability to make the kind of judgements necessary to get a full grasp on the issue. I think I'll try to find a good book or some other resource. I did get a couple good suggestions, and I appreciate that. But most of my questions were along the lines of ""what would happen if this happened"" and it seems that you can't really answer those kinds of questions with any degree of certainty. Which is pretty much what I expected, but at the same time I was a bit hopeful that I'd find at least some people who could help answer the questions. I'm kind of a perfectionist, and I hate it when I can't get the answers I want, so I'm a bit disappointed. But I'll just take that as a good sign that I should try to learn more about physics, and not give up. Thanks again everyone. I've heard lots of different answers to this question. Some people say that gravity is a curvature of space time, and therefor time would stop because there is no space time for it to curve in. Some people say that gravity is a curvature of space time, and therefor time would stop because space time is curved. Some people say that gravity is a curvature of space time, and therefor time would stop because time is curved. Some people say that gravity is a curvature of space time, and therefor time would not stop because the curvature is actually a ripple in space time and there is no ripple where the singularity is. Some people say that gravity is a curvature of space time, and therefor time would not stop because time is curved, and so it would appear to stop from an observer outside the black hole, but it would still be moving. Some people say that gravity is a curvature of space time, and therefor time would not stop because space time is curved, and so it would appear to stop from an observer outside the black hole, but it would still be moving. I think you get the point. What I'm trying to find out is if time stops at the singularity of a black hole, or if it continues on as normal. I'm not really a physicist, so I have no idea if any of the explanations I've heard are right. I was hoping someone here could shed some light on the issue. I'm hoping for a definitive answer, but I realize that's probably not possible. If anyone could point me in the direction of a good book or something, I'd really appreciate it. Ok, I think I found my answer. Thanks for everyone's help. The Kerr space-time has a curvature singularity at the point of zero radius r0. It is expected on physical grounds that the singularity will be somehow removed if we consider the quantum-mechanical aspects of the gravitational field and the effects of the rotating matter near the singularity. However, the quantum theory of gravitation has not yet been formulated and thus we cannot say anything definite about the nature of the singularity. The Kerr space-time is an exact solution of the vacuum Einstein equations, hence it is not possible to model the formation of the black hole, which requires a solution of the Einstein equations with matter. You know, I've read that same sentence, or one very much like it, a hundred times. It doesn't really help me understand how time can both stop and not stop. I know, and I'm sorry I couldn't help you. You want to know how time can both stop and not stop? Time is just a parameter, it doesn't actually stop. So the actual question is whether the parameter ""time"" remains defined at the event horizon and singularity. I think the answer is: it depends on how you define ""time."" See, time is simply a parameter. In general relativity, we can have an event X that is simultaneous with events Y and Z, which are not simultaneous with each other. Einstein argued that we cannot have such a situation, so we need to pick an arbitrary coordinate system, such that an event X is simultaneous with all events Y and Z which are simultaneous with X.

What makes this right different than other rights we enjoy? I'm sorry, but I don't believe in a ""right"" to carry a weapon. If you're carrying a weapon, you're planning on using it, and if you're planning on using it, you're planning on killing someone. I don't believe in a right to kill, and don't see how anyone can. I personally don't carry a weapon, unless I'm hunting, and I don't believe I've ever had the need to use one for anything other than hunting, and if I did, I hope I have the sense not to. I don't think it should be a right to own a gun, I think it should be a privilege. I think the way we handle gun ownership in this country is irresponsible. With that said, I have a hard time thinking of any scenario where I would support a ban on guns. And I also think the way we handle gun ownership in this country is irresponsible.

But this whole discussion is about gun control, isn't it? The reason we're talking about guns is because they're the easiest way to kill someone. Is that a fact? I don't think so. Do you think we're talking about guns because it's easy to kill someone with one? Or because it's easy to kill a lot of people with one?

OpenAI,cmv-182,"Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: ""how does it come about that this right is inherent?"" What makes this right inherent is a matter of debate among individuals and philosophical viewpoints. Some argue that it is a natural right, as it derives from the fundamental principles of individual liberty and self-defense. Others argue that it is a cultural right that has been enshrined in legal documents such as the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Regardless of the view one holds, it is clear that the right to bear arms has a long history and is deeply ingrained in American culture. It has been protected by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution since its founding, and many Americans see it as a crucial element of personal freedom and protection against government tyranny. However, it is also a complex issue that requires careful consideration and balancing of various interests and values."

And again why an automatic weapon cant kill several hundred ppl so fast within seconds instead 3 rounds being fired by different persons while others reload manually during pause time? Just seems strange requiring somthing else when something already exists ready made... Also whats wrong wih civilians having GUNS yet police officers carrying machine pistols strapped around chest area.. Im sure those bullets cost money too.....And lets talk medical costs associated depending whether shooting took place inside house, hospital bed OR outside ... As far back doctors used wooden sticks -or- knives-to cut babies limbs off....Now days surgeon uses sharp stainless steel tools......Whats up street gangs selling drugs compared drug dealers outta jail setting shop??

Human,cmv-182,"Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: ""how does it come about that this right is inherent?"" What makes this right inherent? There is a difference between rights granted by law and natural rights. Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherentnatural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.) There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists. If ""Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter."" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature? ""It just does"" is not a sufficient answer. Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated. I actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a ""gun-grabber"" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone. To be clear: I could give a about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all. At the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter. I am currently against both ""gun grabbers"" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate. Tell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end. if you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate any argument defending your position), you are probably not really going to convince anyone. But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save? To claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God. I see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also ""justify"" the ""rights of monkeys to bear arms.

Tsinghua,cmv-183,"If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to understand how that can be, but if we look at it from the perspective of modern science, we see that heroin addicts had been missing out on their immune systems' natural ability to fight off infection. Presumably, the immune system was there to fight infection, but the addict had a much weaker immune system. This may be the reason why most addictions end spontaneously. But it may also be why heroin addicts don't get ill from heroin use. 7. The S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions We may know that emotion is a response to an external stimulus, but that's only half the story. What really drives our emotions is how we see the world around us. When we experience something we like, we tend to see the world in a favorable light. When we experience something we dislike, we tend to see the world in a negative light. This is called the S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions. The S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions 75 What do you think of when you hear the word ""blue""? Does your mind automatically turn to the color blue? Or do you automatically think of sadness?

If we experience something we dislike, we tend to see the world in a negative light. This is the S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions. 76 S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions How does this relate to drug addiction? Drug addiction is not a disease. It's a learned behavior. We can learn to be addicted to anything. If we learn to like heroin, we will see the world in a favorable light. If we learn to dislike heroin, we will see the world in a negative light. And if we learn to dislike a drug, we will learn to like a different drug. We can choose what drug we want to be addicted to. 77 S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions So why do people get addicted to drugs? We already know that addiction is a learned behavior. And we already know that drug addiction is a learned behavior. But how do you learn to like heroin? There are many ways, but the easiest way is to go through withdrawal. Withdrawal is painful. If you're addicted to heroin, you will go through withdrawal when you're not using heroin. But when you're not using heroin, you will experience withdrawal symptoms. And if you experience withdrawal symptoms, you will want to go back to using heroin. So you will learn to like heroin. 78 S-E-I-Z Theory of Emotions In addition, when you go through withdrawal, you are not in your normal state of mind. You will be worried about your physical and emotional well-being. You will be thinking about the drugs you are using. And you will be thinking about the drugs you are using. And you will be thinking about the drugs you are using. You will want to use heroin to help you through withdrawal.

PaLM,cmv-183,"If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75% of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It’s hard to say for sure, but there are a few possible explanations. First, it’s important to remember that addiction is a complex phenomenon. There are many different factors that can contribute to addiction, including genetics, environment, and personal experiences. Not all addictions are the same, and not all people who are addicted to the same substance will experience the same symptoms or have the same outcome. Second, it’s possible that some people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol are able to overcome their addiction on their own. This may be due to a number of factors, such as strong personal motivation, a supportive social network, or access to effective treatment resources. Third, it’s important to consider the fact that many people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol do not seek treatment. This is often due to a number of factors, such as shame, stigma, or fear of legal consequences. As a result, it’s possible that the statistics on addiction recovery are skewed, and that the actual number of people who are able to overcome their addiction is higher than what is reported. In the case of Vietnam veterans, there are a number of factors that may have contributed to their high rate of recovery from heroin addiction. First, many of these veterans were exposed to high-stakes situations that required them to be extremely focused and disciplined. This training may have helped them to develop the skills and resources they needed to overcome their addiction. Second, many veterans returned home to a supportive environment, with family and friends who were willing to help them get through their recovery. Finally, the Vietnam War was a traumatic experience for many veterans, and their addiction may have been a way of coping with the trauma. Once they were able to address the trauma, they may have been able to overcome their addiction. It’s important to note that addiction is a serious problem, and that recovery is not always easy. However, it is possible to overcome addiction, and there are many resources available to help people who are struggling."
OpenAI,cmv-183,"If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to determine why some individuals with addiction are able to recover without treatment while others require professional help. However, some studies suggest that a strong support system, a change in environment, and personal motivation can play a role in spontaneous recovery. Regarding the Vietnam veterans who were addicted to heroin, it's worth noting that their environment and circumstances likely changed significantly when they returned home. They were no longer in a war zone and may have had better access to resources and support to help them overcome their addiction. That being said, addiction is a chronic and relapsing disease, and while some may be able to recover without treatment, professional help and ongoing support can greatly increase the likelihood of long-term recovery."
BigScience,cmv-183,"If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to answer these questions. The problem isn't that doctors aren't capable of treating this type of patient; it's just that there have never been any good studies about how best to treat them. Pharmacological therapies are considered ineffective because ""reinforcement"" takes place not through drugs but other things like food or sex. People can also use substances for off-label purposes such as pain management and sleep disturbances (to name only two examples). In addition, many patients simply don't want their doctor telling them what to do with their own lives-including where to get high-and may be unwilling to take medications prescribed by someone who doesn't seem knowledgeable enough about the situation (for example, if an army chaplain told him he should stop using heroin). So what can we do to help these people function at least minimally while waiting on medical treatments? Drugs The first thing to try to avoid is a substance abuse counselor. You'd probably find more success getting into trouble over the telephone then you would trying to navigate your way out of it face-to-face. (I know I've done both.) Use benzodiazepines occasionally instead of alcohol-they're safe even after prolonged use-but seek professional help immediately if you're poisoned. Toxicology tests cannot detect past intake (s) so no harm will come from having one taken regularly. Don't worry too much about your blood test results unless they suggest you've had substantial amounts of certain narcotics that might cause seizures or withdrawal symptoms later. If tox reports show recent substance use, tell your health care provider right away; he's better equipped than anyone else to decide whether you need additional testing (and which ones), especially since sometimes all that's needed is urine screening to rule out ongoing contamination rather than ""positive"" toxicology reports due to repeated ingestion. In terms of short term detoxification, half-life calculations guide dosage choices; for example, 5-day courses lasting 3 days each usually deliver roughly 50 percent fewer doses per day compared to 10-day courses lasting 4 days each. Avoid naloxone-supplemented medication during recovery. Long-term maintenance programs provide access to subsidized long-term housing, employment training services and social support groups. Some free drug courts offer low-income defendants alternative punishments: sentencing relief andor time served under parole supervision within a court system designed specifically for offenders using prescription opioids. 7 There may be something comparable available to veterans seeking assistance with nonmedical substance misuse-both federal and state governments must meet legal requirements before providing public funds to private agencies; however, military personnel often receive special benefits regardless of government funding status. Special Significance For years now, our society has worried about growing numbers of ""veterans"" facing homelessness, unemployment and criminal convictions stemming from addiction problems. But attention has recently turned toward another group-often overlooked in discussions about post-911 violence and war trauma: former members of the U.S. military struggling against serious mental illnesses associated with combat and deployment. Unfortunately, few resources exist yet to assist those suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety disorders. And although the majority of service men and women return home relatively quickly following deployment-too soon to assess progress already made-it seems prudent to keep active efforts underway until proven otherwise. A series of research projects funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs was announced last year to study ways to prevent PTSD among soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 8 Among several potential interventions being tested are: educational outreach aimed at increasing awareness of mental illnesses; psychological intervention focused on reducing traumatic exposure through narrative therapy for older servicemembers; pharmacologic formulations derived from clinical trials demonstrating efficacy for preventing relapse by individuals experiencing early onset psychosis; exercise-based strategies promoting mindfulness skills (a skill commonly studied but rarely taught outside of meditation retreats) which could reduce reactivity to harmful stimuli; community based peer mentoring programs; and evidencebased information technology initiatives to improve communication between deployed troops and healthcare providers. And there's always more research to go around."
LLAMA,cmv-183,"If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to believe that this was a matter of willpower, given the presumed power of addiction. The article cites a study where 90 percent of people addicted to marijuana quit on their own. In fact, I can think of several people who used to smoke pot who quit on their own. One thing that I do think is a problem is that our society tends to think of addiction as a permanent condition. If you're an alcoholic, you'll be one for the rest of your life. Once you're an addict, you'll always be an addict. So if you fall off the wagon, you might think, ""I'm a failure! I'm an addict for life!"" Whereas if you don't think of it as a permanent condition, you might think, ""Well, I guess I'll just have to try again to quit."" But it's the stigma that causes the problem, not the condition. The study that was cited suggests that people get over addictions by forming new social bonds. In other words, they have new relationships, and those new relationships replace the old addiction. For instance, I had a friend who was addicted to playing a video game. He had to go to a treatment program to kick his addiction. Why did he get addicted to the video game? Because it filled a void in his life. He was unemployed and had a lot of free time, so he played the video game. So what helped him stop playing? He got a job. Think about it: if you have a really interesting job, you don't have time to be addicted to anything, because your job is so interesting. I've heard this from a number of people, including a friend who quit his job as a drug dealer and became a medical marijuana farmer. He said that when he was a drug dealer, he sold drugs to get money to buy more drugs. But when he became a medical marijuana farmer, he was too busy to smoke pot, and he didn't have time to get high. The idea that addiction is a disease is based on the idea that some people have addictive personalities. And yet, we don't even know what that means. It's always struck me that the term ""addictive personality"" is a judgment call. For instance, I've heard a number of people say that Bill Clinton has an addictive personality. Yet is he addicted to sex? No. Is he addicted to power? No. Is he addicted to cigars? No. Is he addicted to food? No. So what is he addicted to? He's addicted to . . . nothing. But he has an ""addictive personality."" Even though the DSM is a secular document, it has a religious aspect. The religion is ""humanist fundamentalism,"" the belief that humans can solve all problems if they just try hard enough. So if someone has an addiction, then it must be that they're not trying hard enough to get rid of it. Of course, this attitude is also used against people who are overweight, and have no control over their weight. If they just tried hard enough, then they could lose weight. The religious aspect of the DSM is that it assumes that humans are basically perfectible, and that if there's a problem, then it can be solved by a combination of psychotherapy and pharmaceuticals. In the case of addiction, the DSM has a very different approach than AA. In AA, the addict admits to having a problem, and admits that there's nothing he can do to solve it on his own. This idea of giving up one's ego is completely foreign to the DSM. In the DSM, the addict is told, ""You can control this problem! You just have to try harder!"" So why are so many addicts helped by AA, but not the DSM? Because the DSM doesn't help people get over their addictions. AA does. When the addict goes to AA, he realizes that he's not alone. Other people have the same problem. They understand what he's going through. And this is something that AA does that the DSM doesn't do. The DSM is a cold, detached, rationalistic, secular document,"

It's hard to picture a brain disease such as schizophrenia simply going away because someone decided not be schizophrenic anymore. Imagine a schizophrenic telling you about his condition and you responding by, yeah, I know what you mean, I drink a lot. It totally absolves any responsibility by calling it a disease and is offensive to anyone with a real disease that they can't fix by just doing less of something destructive.

But there's also true stories aimed toward a certain audience in mind: tragic love stories like Romeo Juliet or West Side Story; children's books with moral lessons (like The Little Red Hen) or inspirational stories through the eyes of an adult character (Like Don Quixote). Even though these works can be entertaining, they're primarily written because they aim towards those particular audiences. The authors who write poetry, novels, short-stories, plays... all these kinds of literary pieces do so intentionally because there must always be something other people will learn from their work. And if you don't want others learning anything then you're really not doing your job... There's no reason to tell kids about how heroes fight battles using swords when sword fighting isn't even real! Why would anyone even read Aesop's Fables? If it were only fun things they'd remember, then we wouldn't need reading comprehension!

So the answer is ""entertainment"" and ""reflection."" Thursday, March 22, 2010 When I was a child, my dad used to play me an album by Neil Young called ""If I Could Only Remember My Name."" It's a song cycle about a boy who grows up to be a successful singer, but the lyrics are all about his pain. And the music is beautiful, haunting, and completely aching. I've always been moved by it, but today I was particularly moved. And not just by the lyrics, although they are the main reason. I was moved by the way the music is written. I think it's the most beautiful music I've ever heard. I can't explain why. I'm just going to let it sink in for a while. I love the way the first verse begins with an ascending melody that sounds like a little boy's voice, singing in the back of a classroom. And then it turns into a strange ascending melody that sounds like a crow, and then a descending melody that sounds like a bird chirping. It's haunting and beautiful and strange. And then the music moves into a baroque pop melody, and the song becomes a symphony. It's very good. And the music is haunting, beautiful, and strange.

Most works of literature have some kind of message or lesson to impart, and they can help us to understand ourselves and the world around us. Literature can teach us about different cultures and ways of life. It can help us to see things from other people's perspectives, and to become more tolerant and understanding. It can also help us to develop our empathy and compassion. Literature can also inspire us. It can give us hope when we feel lost or hopeless. It can motivate us to achieve our goals.

Here are some specific examples of how literature can benefit our society:  Literature can promote peace and understanding. By exposing us to different cultures and perspectives, literature can help us to break down stereotypes and prejudices. It can also help us to understand the causes of conflict, and to find ways to resolve them peacefully.  Literature can encourage critical thinking. By challenging our assumptions and beliefs, literature can help us to develop our critical thinking skills.

Human,cmv-184,"I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say ""entertainment,"" but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have some sort of moral dilemma that questions an aspect of our society. A good piece of writing is designed to make the reader feel empathetic towards the characters, so the events that occur due to the choices the characters make with regards to the dilemma, in the end will suggest to the reader what is right versus what is wrong. I was discussing this with my girlfriend the other day, and we used ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as an example. My point was that this book shows (among other things) that racism and prejudice is morally wrong. She argued that this wasn't the intention of the book; the book just addresses the issue of prejudice in a neutral way, and it is up to the reader's internal moral compass to decide whether racism is right or wrong. While it is certainly possible to read the book and not have your views on racism changed, I argue that it was the author's intention to suggest that it was wrong. Here, I extend my argument to the majority of all literature. Great works of literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, etc, are all intended to persuade readers to one side of a moral issue. Over history, stories and literature are a great way of defining what we as a race have defined as right and wrong. CMV! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

OpenAI,cmv-184,"I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say ""entertainment,"" but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature go beyond just providing entertainment and have a significant impact on our society. Through literature, we are able to gain insights into different cultures, time periods, and experiences. People can use literature to learn about human behavior and emotions, explore new ideas, and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. Moreover, literature helps people develop empathy, as they can gain a unique perspective into the experiences of others. By exploring unfamiliar situations through literature, people learn what it's like to walk in someone else's shoes, which can ultimately shape their worldview. In addition to that, literature has the power to inspire people and motivate them to bring change to the world. Many works of literature have had a profound impact on history, such as the abolitionist movement with works like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" by Harriet Beecher Stowe, or ""The Communist Manifesto"" by Karl Marx. Overall, literature has the potential to be a force for good in our society by teaching us about ourselves and the world around us, helping to develop empathy, and even inspiring us to take action for positive change."

Human,cmv-186,"I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should ""Deal with it"" that they need to realize that the internet is the future and trying to fight piracy is impossible (or prohibitively expensive) in a free web. A little bit about myself, and my habits I am 20 years old, a liberal raised on the internet and currently in school studying film. I have torrented rarely for probably 5 years, but I would consider myself on the bottom end of piracy. I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime and Spotify, and usually buy my games on steam. Because of these services I never pirate music or games ever, and I usually do not pirate Television or Movies either. As an aspiring filmmaker myself, it feels hypocritical to steal someone else's hard work, and so if at all possible I do not do that. I am more than willing to pay 3-5 dollars to rent a movie I want to watch. But this is not the internet we live in. While some movies are available on youtube, itunes and amazon instant for rental, many are either only available to buy or not available at all. On top of that, these services tend to have a charge to rent the ""HD"" version of the film, a practice I believe to be archaic and stupid in an age where everyone has HD monitors andor TVs. In my mind, if there were a service that made a huge selection of films available for a one-time viewing for 5 easily and at full quality with options for downloading if need be I personally would never pirate films or TV. However, this may not represent the consumer base as a whole and may not be enough to save the companies afraid of the internet. (WARNING: I AM GOING OFF WHAT I HAVE READ IN THIS SECTION I DO NOT HAVE SOURCES FOR MY CLAIMS YET) While Spotify does seem mitigate piracy, it also does not give much money to artists as a rule. But, at the same time, most artists make their money from touring and not from album sales, as the record label would end up taking most of the money from itunesCD sales anyways. So part of me thinks that in this open age that perhaps it is the companies that should fail, if they cannot accept the internet's existence, freeing the artists to receive more money for sales directly from services such as Spotify and iTunes. The same applies to movies, television (which Netflix has helped a lot, I think) and games (I don't know many people who pirate games, since they are readily available on Steam and GOG.com as a rule) as well. TL;DR I think the companies fighting piracy should give up and try to mitigate it instead adapt rather than fight. What do you think? Change my view! Hello, users of CMV!

BigScience,cmv-186,"I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should ""Deal with it"" that they have a very poor understanding of how this works. So my question is - what are some good resources for teaching yourself about copyright law? Though I'm not specifically looking for any legal advice (other than ""yes or no you can sue someone over something like this?, I do want other people's opinionsexperiences. Please note that the answers must be relevant to copyright laws at large, but if your answer also includes specific issues I've raised above then it's fine by me. A: You need to understand the basics first. Specifically: What does ""copyright protection"" mean? For example, the typical definition used to describe things covered under the U.S. Copyright Act might be: a work created through human ingenuity andor skill; This is actually pretty broad because there may be several definitions within one jurisdiction e.g., Germany would define ""a musical composition as an entirety which has been arranged according to certain rules""; while France might consider ""the arrangement of notes only (without melody) as independent artistic expression protected."" Is a piece of music really protected from copying? The most common argument here is that: - A person who copies content illegally can't get paid anything for their work; and - Although he knows that his copy was made without permission, nobody will know unless there is proof. How do courts decide cases involving infringement? In general, courts evaluate three categories of evidence when evaluating whether an infringer could legally make the copied work: Original intent: Does the original artwork expressly state its intention to prohibit copying? This category typically excludes photographs illustrations where the artist's explicit intent doesn't apply because those tend to be more freely shared. Intention behind use: Does the creator intend others to use the product as intended? (For example, where the author creates an illustration which instructs users NOT TO USE IT FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE) Intentionality: Does the user knowingly break the terms stated? Here, Court uses ""intended purpose"" as being far less important than ""explicit prohibition."" Can anyone prove actual illegal activity? Even though the defendant plans to distribute material using various methods such as: physical media (CD-ROMs etc.), digital distribution sites (like download communitieswhere the files aren't stored anywhere other than the user's computerthe same technicalities apply.) A: In addition to JohnHillman answer below, I'd recommend learning more about Creative Commons licenses. The free version covers almost all aspects except for third party rights usage."

This is an opinion I completely disagree with, and I believe that any company should be able to do whatever it wants to try to prevent piracy and people who pirate should be willing to deal with it. When you pirate a game you are preventing a company from making money, and you're not paying for anything. You're not paying for a service or a product that you're not receiving, you're taking a product that you don't deserve or have a right to. You're taking something that costs the developer time and money to create and you're not giving them anything in return. You're not buying it and you're not getting a free demo of it. You're just taking it because you can, and I can't see any reason why you should be allowed to do that, and I can't see any reason why a company shouldn't be allowed to stop you from doing that. It's not like a free demo of a game where you get to try it out and make a decision on whether to purchase it or not. If you pirate a game you know for sure whether you like it or not. You can play it for as long as you want and then decide that you don't want to pay for it. You're not giving the company a chance to sell you the game, you're just taking it. A lot of people say that they only pirate games they're going to buy later, or games that they can't afford, but I don't think that's the case. If you can't afford a game then you can't afford it and you shouldn't be playing it. If you can't afford it then you don't have the right to play it, simple as that. If you pirate it then you're taking something you have no right to take. And if you want to play a game before you buy it then you should be buying a demo of it or buying the full game and then returning it. Some people also say that they'll only pirate games that they don't like, but I don't think that's really what's going on. If you really didn't like the game then you probably wouldn't play it for very long, and if you really liked the game then you would probably want to pay for it. The reason people pirate games is that they don't want to pay for it, they don't feel like it's worth the money. They want to play it but they don't want to pay for it, so they just take it. And I think that's the real reason why people are so opposed to companies preventing piracy. They don't want to pay for it and they don't want to have to deal with a company trying to stop them from playing it for free. It's not that they don't like always-online DRM or that they think it's too invasive, it's that they don't want to have to deal with it to play a game for free. They don't like the idea of not being able to play a game at any time they want, or of having to deal with the possibility that the game might not work when they want to play it. They don't like the idea of having to deal with restrictions when they're trying to play a game for free. And I think that's why people are so opposed to companies trying to stop piracy. It's not that they think that people have a right to pirate games, it's that they don't want to have to deal with companies trying to stop them from getting something for free. Labels: Game Piracy"
Tsinghua,cmv-187,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on creating a single, unifying narrative that applies to all of the liberal's views. I call this group the ""narrative liberals."" The second faction believes that the best way to advance liberalism is through the policy, not the narrative. I call this group the ""policy liberals."" These two groups often oppose each other, but they do not always. Sometimes the two groups can find a common ground, but this usually requires compromise on both sides. The question is, what kind of compromise is it that liberals can make? It is not easy to find the common ground between the two factions, but they are in agreement on the following points: A single, unifying narrative that is the best way to advance liberalism. If the goal is to advance liberalism, then there is no reason to disagree with this. The single, unifying narrative can be any number of things, but there are only two narratives that seem to be popular with liberals. The first narrative is a ""Social Justice"" narrative. The second narrative is a ""Free Market"" narrative. Each of these two narratives is not inherently bad. Social Justice can be an extremely powerful force in society. The Free Market can be the foundation for economic growth and prosperity. Both of these narratives are a necessary part of advancing liberalism. Both of these narratives are the most popular liberal narratives. Social Justice and Free Market. Social Justice is the most popular liberal narrative. Social Justice is the liberal narrative that most liberals tend to gravitate toward. This is a very good thing. The only problem is that this narrative tends to promote groupism and identity politics. Social Justice advocates tend to promote identity politics, as well as the belief that one's identity is more important than one's beliefs. Identity politics is a direct attack on the individual. This narrative also promotes a group-think mentality, where it is very difficult for one to disagree with the narrative. If you disagree with the narrative, you are not a liberal. If you do not agree with the narrative, you are an oppressor. If you do not agree with the narrative, you are a racist. If you do not agree with the narrative, you are a sexist. If you do not agree with the narrative, you are a misogynist. The best way to deal with the social justice narrative is to expose it for what it is. This is not easy. The social justice narrative is very popular, and it is very difficult to dismantle. In fact, it is very difficult to even understand. The best way to expose the social justice narrative is to have a frank discussion about it. Expose the Social Justice Narrative. Social Justice Narrative. The Free Market is the second most popular liberal narrative. Free Market is the liberal narrative that tends to be the most popular among conservatives. This is a very good thing. The only problem is that this narrative tends to promote greed and short-term thinking. Free Market advocates tend to promote short-term thinking, as well as the belief that one's success is more important than one's beliefs. Free Market advocates tend to be very individualistic, where it is very difficult for one to disagree with the narrative. If you disagree with the narrative, you are not a liberal. If you do not agree with the narrative, you are a capitalist. If you do not agree with the narrative, you are a hypocrite. The best way to deal with the Free Market narrative is to expose it for what it is. This is not easy. The Free Market narrative is very popular, and it is very difficult to dismantle. In fact, it is very difficult to even understand. The best way to expose the Free Market narrative is to have a frank discussion about it. Expose the Free Market Narrative. Free Market Narrative. Both of these narratives are important to advancing liberalism. If we can find a way to find common ground between the two narratives, then liberalism will advance even faster. The only problem is that liberals cannot find a way to find common ground between the two narratives. The Social Justice Narrative is very popular, and it is very difficult to dismantle. The Free Market Narrative is very popular, and it is very difficult to dismantle. There is a common ground between the two narratives. They are both liberal narratives. Liberals cannot find a way to compromise on the narrative. Liberals are ideologically opposed to the narrative. They are opposed to the narrative, not because they are against the narrative itself, but because they are against the ideology that is behind the narrative. Liberals do not want to compromise on the narrative, because they do not want to compromise on the ideology. If liberals can find a way to compromise on the ideology, then liberalism will advance even faster. Conclusion Liberals are opposed to each other. The liberal narrative is very popular. The liberal narrative is very popular, and it is very difficult to dismantle. The liberal narrative is the foundation of liberalism."
BigScience,cmv-187,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on structural reform (i.e., ""big government"" and some sort of national socialism). They believe in a strong state that redistributes wealth through taxation or confiscation. The second category tends toward universalistic reforms such as free education for all children. These people think we can end extreme poverty by allowing everyone an opportunity at university regardless of economic circumstances. Inequality has no place in liberal society because they wouldn't be there if it did not exist. (For those who don't know: most Americans do NOT live below the federal poverty line.)"
LLAMA,cmv-187,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on the social aspects of liberalism, embracing a traditional ""liberal"" view on things like welfare, taxation, and other economic matters. The second is more concerned with the rights of individuals, and often finds itself in opposition to the first faction on social issues. The first faction is a dying breed. You'll find them in the halls of academia, but few in the real world. They are the keepers of the faith, and their biggest problem is that they believe in a religion that has long been proven wrong. The second faction, on the other hand, is growing. It embraces social liberalism, but rejects the economic policies that have for so long been its bedfellows. This group is generally younger, more forward-thinking, and more open to libertarian-leaning ideas. The reason I bring all of this up is because I recently received an email from a fellow liberal, of the second faction, who thought my recent criticisms of welfare were too harsh. To wit: I am still kind of struggling with the idea of welfare... On the one hand, I see your point and agree with it. No one should be dependent on the government, it's bad for the individual and the country as a whole. On the other hand, I think some people need a little help to get them on their feet. I think that with the right training, most of those on welfare could get jobs and support themselves, they just don't have the skills to do so. And for the most part, I think the American people don't mind helping those who are trying to help themselves. I think this is a common misconception among liberals. And while I don't want to speak for all liberals, I'd like to address the notion that welfare is supposed to be a ""hand up,"" rather than a ""hand out."" The idea here is that welfare is not supposed to be a permanent fixture in someone's life, but merely a temporary solution. The recipient should get their lives together, get a job, and become a self-sufficient, productive member of society. This is not how the system actually works. The system is not designed to give people a hand up; it is designed to give people a handout. In order to understand why, you need to look at how the system has evolved over time. The history of welfare in America starts with Franklin Roosevelt. His ""New Deal"" policies included a number of programs aimed at relieving the suffering of the poor. He also introduced Social Security. The Social Security program was created in order to provide income for retirees. At the time, the average life expectancy of Americans was much shorter than it is today. In 1930, for example, the average life expectancy for an American man was 58 years. The average life expectancy for women was 62 years. This means that the average person who started receiving Social Security payments would only get 13 to 17 years of payments. The other key difference between Social Security then and Social Security now is that it was not meant to provide a comfortable retirement. It was meant to prevent destitution. In the 1930s, only 54 of men had private pensions, and only 22 of women had private pensions. That means that the vast majority of Americans had nothing to retire on. Social Security was meant to prevent the elderly from falling into abject poverty. It wasn't meant to provide a comfortable, worry-free retirement. Today, Social Security still isn't a lavish program. The average recipient gets 1,230 per month. The maximum a recipient can get is 2,533. But the program has changed in other ways. Life expectancy has gone up significantly, and the program now pays for far more than just retirement. In 1939, the year the first Social Security check was issued, 53,236 people received benefits. In 2011, that number was over 55 million. And that doesn't include the millions of people who receive disability or supplemental security income. The program has been expanded far beyond what its original architects intended. But it wasn't until Lyndon Johnson that the federal government really got into the welfare business. In 1965, President Johnson signed into law two bills that"

The first faction is heavily focused on power and wealth accumulation for themselves (and their friends). Not surprisingly they don't care about racism or sexism as long it doesn't get in there way - whether that's women who want a better life without being forced back home by an abusive husbandfathers; immigrants trying desperately not be ghettoized when all around them succeed economically simply because ""they came here legally""; blacks fighting against workplace discrimination although many now own homes worth 200K with no mortgage - unlike those damn white people working minimum wage jobs at Wal Mart etc... The second group isn "" t really interested either but rather believes everyone should just pull up his bootstraps so he can do things like vote democrat if you're black even though your community has been run over time after timne since Reconstruction......It goes round nround from day-today depending upon some recent incident where someone was denied service somewhere....you know how these folks roll!

OpenAI,cmv-187,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on social justice issues such as gender, race, LGBTQ rights, and environmentalism. They prioritize equality and ""woke"" culture over almost all other issues. The second faction is more moderate and focuses on traditional liberal values such as universal healthcare, living wages, and workers' rights. They prioritize economic issues over social issues. However, it's important to note that there is a lot of overlap between these two factions and not all liberals can be neatly categorized into one or the other."
Human,cmv-187,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the ""social justice"" movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight. The second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin."

I'll try a thing or two, and maybe taste it again if it's too hardcore, but generally I'm not into coffee. What about you? Have you tried any new flavors lately that you're enjoying? Tell us in the comments below! It's very interesting how people can have different reactions towards caffeine depending on their genetics body chemistry! This is so awesome!!! I'm going through this right now as well! When I started working out regularly at 20 years old, I felt terrible afterwards: my heart would race way faster than usual, I was sweaty all over, dizzy, exhausted... The worst part: Some days were worse then some others! (Based also upon stress levels). It took me almost 5 months before I finally realized what had happened - apparently there are differences between genetically ""caffeinated"" vs ""challenged"" individuals who may react differently. So far, I've found that one cup of espresso gives me energy, drive, motivation AND keeps my focus sharp enough to accomplish things; however, an excessive amount will leave me feeling jittery and anxious. (And that's why I usually only drink 1-2 cups per day!) Yes, we're sensitive to caffeine; even when someone else loves coffee-too much-for-every-day, they still might be uncomfortable with it since our bodies can vary from person-to-other!"
LLAMA,cmv-188,"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends. It was a long, hard road to appreciating the taste of bitter food and beverages. Still, I want to be able to at least say that I've tried it in all its forms and that I've done my due diligence in being a bonafide coffee drinker. As I sit in a cafe, I order my coffee. It comes out in a tall glass with a layer of crema on top. The rich, dark brown color makes it aesthetically pleasing. I take a sip and then another sip and then another. The drink is okay. I can take a few sips, but I cannot say I will crave the drink. At least I've done my due diligence."
OpenAI,cmv-188,"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends That's perfectly okay! We all have different preferences when it comes to taste. Coffee is an acquired taste for many people, but not everyone ends up loving it. If you have tried different types of coffee and still do not enjoy it, that's perfectly valid. Some people prefer tea, hot chocolate, or other caffeine-free drinks. It's important to listen to your own taste buds and drink what you personally enjoy."
Human,cmv-188,"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcoholtobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost. I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years. The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90 of the time, which is delicious by the way. It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like. Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what? Change my view."

Human,cmv-189,"(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge transgender people, I simply want to understand their thought processes. In my opinion there is no reason to change genders. I believe that the genders are equal in every way (except biological and physical differences of course) so why change genders. For someone to say that they feel that they are a certain genders, associates feelings with genders. That leads to interests and emotions being tied to genders, and slowly leads society to have gender roles be popular again. many people I know have disagreed with me however none has changed my mind before I hope someone here can.

BigScience,cmv-189,"(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge anyone. This page isn't about personal attacks, it's about my opinions and experiences. I don't know what the first thing people would think when they saw this picture of a 'kids' film' on Wikipedia (and I'm not even sure if that's technically correct). There are plenty of other pictures out there too for you to get your own idea: I'm just saying it because I have found myself recently questioning whether kids movies really belong anywhere near parentsadult books lists... So far so good then? But maybe you've already noticed something else... The bottom left corner of every single page contains an image which shows us what our categories will be called next week: Picture from I've got a few questions relating to this: 1 - Why do we need all those colours where only one should be necessary? (assuming everything gets moved to its appropriate category soon after finishing with them) 2 - Why make these images look like they're going upside down? 3 - How does scribble work exactly? When things go away, why can't they simply reappear later at their former position? A: Let's start by looking at question 1: We wouldn't use five different colour-coding schemes if we didn't have more than two topics per category. And since we're having fewer topic pages, there's less reason to split them into separate subcategories. The bottom-left box actually displays what's known as the Schematic Diagram; that's the design document used by graphic designers when creating websites. It's intended to show how information flows through the web sitei.e., how links appear relative to each otherand can help users navigate around the site quickly. Now let's talk about question 2: Umm... well, yes, sometimes editing software makes mistakes. It might happen during copy-and-paste operations, especially if you're pasting text snippets without copying any formatting between them. (Edited to add: For example, imagine that every time someone adds a new paragraph in a Wiki article's edit summary field, the cursor jumps back into the previous line.) But most problems usually stem from the fact that editors tend to try to fix whatever problem they've identified directly rather than following instructions such as: Select the entire word before adding signs and dragging them over the selected words. (If possible.) Click both the sign and the last character you'd added - they're almost always adjacent! Delete the unwanted characters. To address question 3: Scribble is a tool embedded within Wikipedia to support the creation of illustrations. You could draw direct shapes using stroke tools, but the majority of people's typesetting accoutrements are much easier to work with. (For instance, many fonts include built-in clipboards that allow you to pick specific glyphs.) In short, it's better to follow guidelines created by professional typographers who've worked hard to come up with defaults that save writers tons of unnecessary headaches."

LLAMA,cmv-189,"(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge people who choose to be transgender. My opinion is that they are like the rest of us and have a choice. I have a lot of personal experience with transgender issues as I have a family member who is transgender. I don't judge that person because that person is like the rest of us and has a choice. I am a Christian and believe that we are all born equal and have the same choices in life. God created us in His image and we have free will to choose how we are going to live our lives. Before I get into this post I want to state that I have done a lot of research on this subject. I have read a lot of material about the subject and watched several documentaries. I am not an expert on the subject, but I do have a lot of knowledge about the subject. I think there is a lot of misinformation out there about the subject of transgender. I also think that most people who talk about the subject on the internet haven't done enough research to be properly informed. They just read a couple of articles and then think they are well versed on the subject. I am not saying that they are not entitled to their opinion. I am saying that you need to be well informed on a subject before you make your decision. The video below is a good place to start and also a good place to research further. The video is from Dr. Michelle Cretella who is a pediatrician and the president of the American College of Pediatricians. I like to use the term gender dysphoria instead of transgender because there are many people out there who think that transgender is something you are born with. I have seen many articles on the internet about transgender people who are in their 60s and 70s who decided to become a transgender. So if it is something you are born with why are there so many people that old who are now transgender? I think that people with gender dysphoria need therapy and not surgery. There is a great video below from the Heterodox Academy that talks about the topic. The video features Dr. Debra Soh a neuroscientist, and Dr. Jonathan Haidt a social psychologist. Both of them are very well educated and have studied the topic of gender dysphoria. They also have some very good information in the video. Gender dysphoria is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. I think the best way to deal with it is to have a good therapist. It is also important to understand that there are some therapists out there who are not well trained in the subject. I have also seen many articles where the transgender person says that they were mistreated by their therapist. This is an example of why it is important to have a therapist who is well trained in the subject. In conclusion I think that gender dysphoria is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with by a trained professional. I don't think surgery is the answer. I also think that there is a lot of misinformation about the subject and people need to be better informed."
LLAMA,cmv-190,"Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 600 songs in our playlist. Is there any advantage to Spotify for people who already have a playlist? I'm using iTunes and I'm fine with it. Re: Spotify - Is it useful for me? You can share playlists with friends. You can also add songs to your library without downloading them onto your computer. In that sense, you can have more music on your library without taking up space on your hard drive. It's really not for me, I just like my iTunes library for music. I do like Pandora though for streaming music. I will admit Spotify is better for sharing music. I think Spotify is perfect for you, if you already have a playlist. That means you already have a music taste that you love. Spotify will allow you to get that, but also give you a wide variety of different music, and help you find new stuff. You can use Spotify to discover new artists, new songs and new genres of music. You can also use it to introduce you to new playlists and of course, to share your playlists with your friends. You can get a new playlist every day. It has over 20 million songs to choose from. Spotify is a great app to share music with your friends. You can also discover new music and stream music for free. I do like Spotify but I'm not ready to give up my playlist on iTunes. They both are good in different ways. I don't see how it can help you since you already have a playlist. But maybe you can use it to discover new songs and artists. You can also use it to share your music with your friends. Spotify has a free version and a paid version. I am using the free version and I think it's perfect for me. I get to listen to music for free and I don't have to pay for anything. It is better to go with the paid version. It does cost, but it's totally worth it because you can listen to music without any interruptions. My friends were telling me about Spotify, but I didn't think it was a big deal. But once I started using it, I realized that it's great. You can share music with friends. You can discover new artists, and you can listen to the latest songs. I have a playlist on iTunes. But I also have a Spotify playlist. I think it's great to have both. You can use Spotify to discover new songs. You can also use it to share your music with your friends.

Tsinghua,cmv-190,"Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 100 songs in their phone. And this is not the first time I have had this problem. So, my question is, can you recommend me a good music player that can play my music, without using up too much space? A: You have two options: Use an app that can store music locally on your phone. This means you have to make sure you are backing up your music to an external source. Upload your music to a cloud service, such as Dropbox or Google Drive. You can then access it from anywhere you have internet. You will have to transfer your music over from your phone to your cloud service. If you choose the second option, I suggest Google Drive, which is free. I suggest using this app because it allows you to have unlimited storage for free."

Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music. I realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest. Knowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again? Edit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information.

LLAMA,cmv-191,"I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before. He's a good communicator, and folks who watch his children's TV show have likely confused him for a scientist. He's not. The easiest way to do this is by a simple search on Google, but it's likely you'll be thinking if you're reading this that you've already tried this. I've heard many people tell me they've tried Google searches, but they only use keywords like'science experiment' or'scientific research', which brings up millions of results. But, I've found that more specific search phrases tend to give better results. Try to limit your search phrases to a single'keyword' that you're trying to find information about, and make sure the search phrase is quite specific. For example, if you're trying to find information about the science of the brain, don't just search for'science' but search for'brain'. He has a degree in mechanical engineering. He's not a scientist. He's not a scientist. He's an engineer. And there's a big difference between the two. Scientists are inquisitive about the world around them and develop methods to systematically test hypotheses. Engineers take what the scientists do and design technology and processes to meet specific needs. Scientists are theorists. Engineers are practical. At first, I felt a little guilty for not being a'scientist' in a traditional sense. But this feeling did not last for long. I'm a researcher. I do'research'. But I'm not a scientist.

Engineers take what the scientists do and design technology and processes to meet specific needs. Scientists are theorists. Engineers are practical. Being an engineer is a worthy and respectable profession. But it's not science. Scientists, especially those in the softer sciences, tend to study what they find interesting. They're curious about the world and want to understand how it works. It's a good thing to be curious. Nye is not a scientist. He's not even close to being a scientist. He's an engineer who has had some popular success explaining science to children. And that's fine. But don't call him a scientist. A lot of scientific research is done in the private sector and not published. Some people are scientists who work for pharmaceutical companies or chemical companies. Scientists are not always professors. Some of the most famous scientists in history have been self-employed or worked for private companies. Being an engineer is a worthy and respectable profession. But it's not science. 'Bill Nye the Science Guy' is the worst thing that happened to science communication. After some thought, I decided that I'm not a'scientist' but instead a'researcher'. There's a big difference. Scientists are inquisitive about the world around them and develop methods to systematically test hypotheses. Researchers find answers to questions and solve problems. A degree in a science subject does not make you a scientist. But if you're performing scientific research, you're a scientist.

OpenAI,cmv-191,"I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before While it is true that Bill Nye did not have a strong professional background in science when he first became well-known as ""The Science Guy,"" it is also important to note that he has since become an advocate for science education and scientific progress. He has worked with various organizations and individuals to promote science education, especially among young people, and has been recognized for his efforts with several awards and honors. It is also worth noting that not all scientists have traditional academic backgrounds, and that many individuals who did not initially pursue scientific careers have made important contributions to scientific research and discovery. Regardless of Nye's specific background, it is valuable to support and encourage efforts to promote scientific literacy and engage people of all ages with scientific ideas and research."
Human,cmv-191,"I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script. Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in engineering from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances. And to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do (did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. So? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists. Edit: [Delta awarded] , albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...] To many of the comments: - Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard. - There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. - I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. - Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye."
PaLM,cmv-191,"I submit that Nye’s public perception of “being a scientist” is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one “scientific” accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before his show debuted. He is not a scientist, but rather a science educator, and there is a difference. Science educators play an important role in society by helping to communicate scientific concepts to the public. They can help to demystify science and make it more accessible to people who may not have had the opportunity to study it in school. Nye has done a great job of this, and his show has been a valuable resource for many people. However, it is important to remember that he is not a scientist himself, and he should not be held to the same standards as those who have actually conducted scientific research. One of the biggest problems with Nye’s public persona is that he often presents himself as if he is a scientist, when he is not. This can lead to people believing that he is more qualified to speak on scientific issues than he actually is. For example, Nye has been known to make inaccurate or misleading statements about climate change, evolution, and other scientific topics. This can be dangerous, as it can lead people to believe things that are not supported by the evidence. Another problem with Nye’s public persona is that he can sometimes come across as condescending and arrogant. This can turn people off from science, as they may not want to listen to someone who they perceive as being dismissive of their intelligence. Nye would do well to remember that he is not the only person who knows about science, and that he should be respectful of those who disagree with him. Overall, I believe that Nye’s public persona is a mixed bag. On the one hand, he has done a great job of communicating science to the public. On the other hand, he can sometimes be inaccurate, misleading, and condescending. I think it would be helpful if Nye were to be more clear about his role as a science educator, and to be more respectful of those who disagree with him. Here are some specific examples of Nye’s inaccurate or misleading statements:  In a 2015 interview with Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson said that “the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of climate change.” This is not true. In fact, a 2019 study by the American Geophysical Union found that “the scientific community is far from reaching a consensus on the role of human activity in climate change.”  In a 2014 episode of his show, Nye claimed that “there is no scientific evidence that supports the idea of intelligent design.” This is also not true. In fact, a 2017 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that “there is currently no scientific evidence to support the claim that any life on Earth was designed by an intelligent cause.”  In a 2017 episode of his show, Nye claimed that “evolution is a fact.” This is not entirely accurate. Evolution is a theory, and it is still subject to revision and refinement. However, the evidence in support of evolution is overwhelming, and it is one of the most well-supported theories in science. In addition to making inaccurate or misleading statements, Nye can also come across as condescending and arrogant. For example, in a 2017 episode of his show, Nye told a Christian caller that “if you don’t believe in evolution, you don’t believe in science.” This is a dismissive and condescending way to talk to someone who has different beliefs. Overall, I believe that Nye’s public persona is a mixed bag. On the one hand, he has done a great job of communicating science to the public. On the other hand, he can sometimes be inaccurate, misleading, and condescending. I think it would be helpful if Nye were to be more clear about his role as a science educator, and to be more respectful of those who disagree with him. Here are some suggestions for how Nye could improve his public persona:  He could be more careful about making inaccurate or misleading statements.  He could be more respectful of those who disagree with him.  He could be more clear about his role as a science educator, and the difference between being a scientist and being a science educator. I believe that if Nye made these changes, he would be able to more effectively communicate science to the public and help to promote a more scientifically literate society."
BigScience,cmv-192,"I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy or find a way around it. Here's what I mean by this: In my Voting System, I am using PHP and MySQL for data storage. In fact, one of the tables that I use stores both Pseudo-Identifiers (the e-mail address) AND the real name. So far so good, but when registering voters, I'm storing all the information in separate fields. Which means every time a user registers, they're being asked about two things - their email ID actual name - as opposed to just having them fill out one field with either an email ID OR a real name. My question is: how much security do we really need? Is there something wrong here? EDIT: To clarify: even though this seems like a big step backwards from what I've been doing before, it was necessary at first due to lack of resources at hand. A: There are many ways to implement voter registration. The best option depends largely on your goals. It sounds like you've got occasion where some users may want to register without actually posting any personal information such as an e-mail address e.g., people who live abroad and no longer receive mail. If that's true then you can easily track those registrations manually and informally through e-mails andor text messages or phone calls. You could also let folks know that it's possible to skip the form entirely after they've registered (or not). On the other hand, if you're trying to make sure only those eligible to participate register, well, you'll need more robust techniques than simply letting folks choose namesemails that aren't associated with Twitter accounts or Facebook profiles. (This might imply additional work to get IDs generated uniquely.) Ideally you'd include nothing less than an opt-in checkbox along with each registration form asking whether the person has shared hisher identity publicly online via social media sites etc."
LLAMA,cmv-192,"I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to actually vote. I'm not sure if that's what you're asking for. I would be for automatic voter registration. I think if you're an adult citizen of this country and you have a Social Security number then you should automatically be registered to vote. You should be required to opt out if you don't want to be registered. I think it's ridiculous that you have to register to vote. It's not like you're joining a private organization that you have to apply for membership to. It's part of being a citizen of this country. I can't remember the last time I voted in person. I've been a registered voter for over 20 years. I don't think I've ever missed an election. And I've been registered for almost 40 years. I've always voted in person but I've had several jobs where I've been given time off to vote. And I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me why it is so hard to get a photo ID. I really don't get it. I'm not a fan of voter ID, and I'm not a fan of mandatory voting. I can't say I'm not a fan of voter ID because I think we should make it harder for people to vote, I'm not a fan of it because I think it's another example of the government wasting its time and taxpayers' money on stuff that is just plain silly. If a person shows up to vote without an ID and they're not on the voter registration list, they're given a provisional ballot. What's the point of showing up to vote in the first place if you know you don't have your ID? It's not like these people have a lot of free time on their hands to spend the day at the polls. Mandatory voting, I'm not sure how that would be enforced. I think it would be a logistical nightmare. Fair enough. I'm not sure how that would be enforced either. I think people who don't vote should be fined. I don't really think that's a logistical nightmare. If people can get fined for other things, they should be fined for not voting. I can see that being a logistical nightmare. I'm not saying I'm against it, but I can see the nightmare. I think a better way to get people to vote is to make it easier for them to vote. Early voting, more polling places, better access to information about candidates. The more hoops you make people jump through, the less likely they are to participate. The problem I have with that is if you make it too easy, you're going to get people voting who don't really care and will vote just because they think they should, or because their friends are voting. I'm a little weird in that I don't think you should be forced to vote, and you shouldn't be forced to register. You should have to register if you want to vote, but you shouldn't have to vote. My opinion is probably pretty unpopular, but it is what it is. I see your point, but I think that if people don't care enough to educate themselves on the issues and candidates, then they shouldn't be voting in the first place. And I'm not saying that just to be snarky. I think everyone should care enough to educate themselves on the issues and candidates, but if they don't, then their opinion isn't really needed. When you have people voting just because they think they should, you get really stupid shit like the 2000 election. The flip side is when you have people who are uneducated about the issues voting, you get stuff like the 2008 and 2012 elections. I don't think you should be forced to vote, and you shouldn't be forced to register. You should have to register if you want to vote, but you shouldn't have to vote. I'm not saying you should be forced to vote. I'm saying it should be made easier for people who want to vote to vote. If someone doesn't want to vote, that's their prerogative.

However, there are many reasons why someone may not be registered to vote, such as not understanding how or where to register, not having the necessary documents, or simply not being aware of the deadline. As a helpful assistant, I would suggest that making voter registration more accessible and convenient can encourage more people to register and ultimately participate in the democratic process. This could include automatic voter registration when obtaining a driver's license or ID, online registration, same-day registration, and outreach efforts in communities where voter participation is historically low."
BigScience,cmv-193,"What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy the system uses to control people (as well as aesthetics), but they're accomplished in other ways than by controlling what you think. I'm not saying that these issues shouldn't take precedence over ""originality"" or ""creativity"" - if something strikes me as stupid then I don't care how clever and original someone else's response might be. But it's important for creatives to know there's no such thing as original thought: just ideas in different contexts and packaging. This means that creativity will never die because we have so many brilliant minds now who can make things better with newer technology. It also means that anyone can do anything; creativity has become more accessible and low threshold thanks to technology rather than harder work. Good question - I'm afraid that's why I've been away from writing posts recently... The main reason I've had trouble coming up with new topics was my lack of time (and therefore mental energy).

We must fearlessly search for the truth, wherever it leads. Brief, conclusory statements are often sufficient to trigger a thought, but they are not sufficient to communicate the truth. A sound premise doesn't always lead to a sound conclusion. A fallacious premise doesn't always lead to a fallacious conclusion. Democracy, by definition, requires that the majority of people be subservient to the ideas of a few. Consensus is not evidence. There is an inverse relationship between the complexity of the system being studied and the certainty of the conclusions drawn. It's easier to argue a point than it is to understand the truth. If an idea or belief is true, it doesn't need to be enforced. The only meaningful truth is a truth that can be validated empirically. Religious beliefs are disguised as ""truths"" but they are not. Ideas and beliefs are not ""true"" until they are validated. Everyone has the right to their own opinions, but not to their own facts.

If you're a transgressive idea, then the political ramifications are going to affect your credibility, right? So if your claim is that feminism is transgressive and you want to remain a credible source of feminist commentary, then you have to choose whether you want to distance yourself from feminism, or choose to engage in the debate and find out what people actually think about feminism. I agree with your point that it's an incorrect premise to start a discussion about something with the assumption that it's transgressive, because it will be impossible to find a position that isn't transgressive in one way or another.

BigScience,cmv-194,"I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say ""Forks are a blight upon society,"" and someone disagrees with what you said, they should be able to disagree in agreement. However I don't think it's ideal for it to be used as a general complaint against anyone who does not have the same viewpoint that we do on almost any topic... unless that's how this site works now. A: I'm also going out of my way to avoid using ""stop people from saying things"" or ""talking about certain topics at all"" because these can easily become abusive. For example, restricting discussing politics may cause me to feel exclusionary (or worse) so I'm more careful when giving guidelines. Mostly, though: This isn't something I've experienced before here but would like to point out: It's very much possible to argue convincingly without running into complaints. There really aren't many examples where such complaints were justified. Take this example: There was no question there; he just didn't get his facts right. (And some other posts.) In fact, it seems most comments were trying to explain why his answer wasn't correct not complain about him saying it wrong. Having said all that: I'd agree whether ""speech"" has been restricted by the merits of one's argument rather than simply being perceived as offensive is up subjective opinion. As long as there's a reasonable explanation given for blocking content regardless of its merit, then it's fine. The only real problem stems from unreasonable restrictions imposed regardless of motivation. But suppose one user says ""I want to talk about cancer research, even when others say it's bad, dangerous, etc. Why can't you let me?"" That's pretty basic freedom of expression that shouldn't require permission. It sounds like you're talking about political opinions, which tend to mean they're controversial. The reason we're strict sometimes is because those political views involve criticism of current government policies which might offend some users. We respect people's rights to express their disagreement, however misguided it may appear. (If your perspective differs substantially enough from the majority consensus andor similar points-of-view, you'll probably still find yourself getting banned.)"

It was an important accomplishment for me, and I was proud of the work I had done. The first half of the book was a lot of fun to write, and I was looking forward to finishing it. Unfortunately, the second half didn't go so well. My main problem was that I got bored with my main character. It was a tough month, and writing something that I wasn't excited about was not helping matters. I kept going, but I didn't like the story I was telling. I couldn't make myself care about it. In 2015, I started a second book. I had a better outline, and a clearer idea of what I wanted to write about. It was a good start, and I was happy with the direction I was taking. It was a sequel to the 2014 book, so I had a better idea of what I wanted to do, and I was more excited about it. However, it didn't go very far. I got 38,000 words in, and I was stuck. I had a better outline, but I didn't know how to get from the middle to the end. I tried a few things, but I wasn't happy with the direction it was going. Again, it was a hard month, and I wasn't enjoying the writing process. In 2016, I started another book. Once again, it was a sequel. Once again, I had a better idea of where I was going. And this time, I was ready to finish it. I started with a good outline, and a lot of enthusiasm. I had a lot more confidence in my ability to write, and I was excited about the story I was telling. I finished that book in a week and a half, and then went on to write another one. So, what changed? Why did I have such trouble in 2014 and 2015, but write two books in 2016? I think the biggest thing that changed was that I took the time to learn more about writing. I read blogs, and read articles, and took courses. I joined a writer's group, and got feedback from other writers. I wrote some short stories, and learned what worked and what didn't. I got better at writing. This year, I didn't complete NaNoWriMo. But that doesn't mean I didn't write. I'm still working on my third book of the year, and I'm going to be working on a fourth in December. I'm still writing, and I'm still learning. I'm still getting better. I love writing. I love telling stories. I want to tell better stories, and I want to write better books. I want to write books that I'm proud of, and that other people will enjoy. I'm still working on that, and I'm going to keep working on it. So, that's what I've learned. It takes time to get better at things. And I don't think that will ever stop. I can"

However, if you state with an idea, let's say ""Forks are a blight upon society,"" and someone disagrees with you, if you immediately jump to free speech as defense of your idea, you are basically admitting that you have no worthwhile arguments. Yes, you are allowed to say that, but if you actually had something to back it up, say ""sporks are far more versatile, cutting the required utensil manufacturing by a third, reducing global warming 93,"" you would say that. Free speech does nothing to back up the validity of your claim, as you are free to be wrong. EDIT: I have been convinced that it can be a way of simply saying you do not wish to argue the point further, that you want to let the argument stand where it does. And, to clarify, I am not talking about free speech as a legal concept. Having to prove your speech legal says nothing as to its validity. I mean having to fall back on free speech as an argument does nothing to prove you right.

In a free society, people should be able to express their opinions without fear of reprisal. This includes the right to say things that others may find offensive or disagreeable. While it is not always easy to hear opinions that we disagree with, it is important to remember that free speech is a fundamental right that we should all fight to protect. When someone expresses an opinion that we disagree with, it is tempting to want to silence them. However, this is the wrong approach. Silencing people who we disagree with only serves to make us more polarized and less likely to find common ground. Instead, we should engage with people who we disagree with and try to understand their point of view. We may not agree with them in the end, but we will at least be better informed about their perspective. The right to free speech is not absolute. There are some limitations, such as the incitement of violence or the dissemination of false information.

In fact, many feminists explicitly state that feminism is about advocating for gender equity and dismantling patriarchal systems that harm both women and men. However, for those who prefer to use the term ""egalitarian"" over ""feminist,"" it's important to remember that the term can be vague and doesn't necessarily acknowledge the specific challenges that women face in our society.

PaLM,cmv-195,"First, I know “egalitarian” is a long word, a lot of people don’t know what it means, and it doesn’t have the history nor the recognition that the word “feminism” does. But I think it’s important to use that word because it’s more accurate than “feminism.” Feminism is a movement for the rights of women, but it’s also a movement for the rights of all people. It’s about creating a world where everyone is treated equally, regardless of their gender, race, class, sexual orientation, or any other factor. So, when I say that I’m an egalitarian, I mean that I believe in equality for all people. I believe that everyone should have the same opportunities, regardless of their circumstances. I believe that everyone should be treated with respect and dignity. And I believe that we should all work together to create a more just and equitable world. I know that some people think that feminism is only about women’s rights. But that’s not true. Feminism is about everyone’s rights. It’s about creating a world where everyone is free to live their lives to the fullest, without fear of discrimination or oppression. So, if you’re someone who believes in equality for all people, then I encourage you to use the word “egalitarian.” It’s a more accurate word than “feminism,” and it sends a clear message about what you believe in. Here are some reasons why I think it’s important to use the word “egalitarian” instead of “feminism”:  Egalitarianism is more inclusive. Feminism is a movement for the rights of women, but it’s also a movement for the rights of all people. Egalitarianism is a more inclusive term that encompasses the rights of everyone, regardless of their gender.  Egalitarianism is more accurate. Feminism is about creating a world where everyone is treated equally, regardless of their gender. Egalitarianism is about creating a world where everyone is treated equally, regardless of any factor.  Egalitarianism is more progressive. Feminism is a movement that has been around for centuries. Egalitarianism is a newer term that reflects the more progressive values of our time. So, if you’re someone who believes in equality for all people, then I encourage you to use the word “egalitarian.” It’s a more accurate, inclusive, and progressive term that reflects the values of our time."
LLAMA,cmv-195,"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" does. So I get why they use it. But I feel like it's disingenuous for those who know the history and know the difference to use it to describe themselves. Second, I have a problem with the idea of ""girl empowerment."" It seems to me that most ""girl empowerment"" is about empowering girls to act like boys. Sure, some things that are traditionally ""girl things"" are discouraged, but many traditionally ""boy things"" are encouraged. They are still reinforcing the idea that boys are the norm and girls need to act like boys in order to be successful. Finally, and most importantly, the idea that a person can be empowered or disempowered by another person is ridiculous. It places the responsibility for women's empowerment on men, and the responsibility for men's empowerment on women. And if we're being honest, there are a lot of men who would rather empower women than actually empower themselves. True empowerment can only come from within. If we want to empower women, we need to empower girls. ""Girl power"" is the idea that girls should be empowered. ""Girl empowerment"" is the idea that girls are empowered. I believe in the power of girls. If we want to empower girls, we need to empower women. Women's empowerment is empowering women. If we want to empower women, we need to empower girls. If we want to empower everyone, we need to empower everyone."

I'm not here to tell you what feminism is, but I'll tell you what egalitarianism is: egalitarianism is a way of thinking that says that everyone has the same value and that society should be fair and equal for everyone. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't any bad people out there. There are plenty of bad people. But what I am saying is that they don't represent the majority of the people, and I'm not here to tell you that there are no bad people out there, because there are bad people out there. What I'm saying is that they are not a majority.

Human,cmv-195,"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or ""feminazis"" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the ""feminazis"" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term ""feminism"" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the ""true feminists"" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously. Change my view guys!"
Human,cmv-196,"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. Men work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women. Men work more standard hours than women. Women take more sick days off work than men. Women are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work. A small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month. To use anecdotal evidence, yesterday I came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. What I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. I am not saying that women deserve to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born, and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. Thus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation."

OpenAI,cmv-196,"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by saying that the following is just an opinion and should not be taken as the truth or the only valid perspective. With that being said, I strongly believe that gun control laws should be stricter to prevent mass shootings and reduce gun violence in general. I understand that the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution gives citizens the right to bear arms, but it was written in a different time and context. This right was meant to allow citizens to protect themselves and their country in a time when it was necessary to fight back against potential invaders or a tyrannical government. However, in today's society, I believe that this right is being abused and misinterpreted by some individuals. The prevalence of guns in our society has led to countless tragedies, from school shootings to mass shootings in public places. It is not just about the mentally ill or criminals obtaining guns illegally; often, the perpetrators of these heinous acts are people who legally obtained guns and then used them to commit murder. I understand that there are many responsible gun owners who use their firearms for hunting, sport shooting, or personal protection, and I believe they should be allowed to keep their weapons. However, I think there should be stricter background checks, waiting periods, and limitations on the types of weapons available for purchase. Assault weapons, for example, serve no purpose in everyday life and are only designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. There is no reason for anyone to have access to them. I understand that there are many arguments against stricter gun control laws, such as the idea that criminals will still obtain guns illegally or that it would be an infringement on our rights. However, I believe that we have to start somewhere to reduce the number of gun-related deaths in our society. We can't just sit back and do nothing while innocent people are killed in senseless acts of violence."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-196,"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by a disclaimer: I am not arguing whether or why we should have more guns in the United States; those are questions for another time entirely (perhaps even never). My claim here relates solely on how they actually work as well their effect upon society at large - it has nothing directly related whatsoever towards gun regulation debates of any sort either domestically within our borders nor internationally across international watersterritories such-like terms like ""gun control"" would apply both legally morally respectively there[1]."
LLAMA,cmv-196,"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by me saying that I am not a veterinarian, but I am a pet parent. I currently have two dogs and two cats in my home, and have had countless pets in my lifetime, all of which were incredibly loved, and many of which were rescued. I also am not taking a side on the whole BSL topic, because that is a separate, and equally important issue. I know that some of you will disagree with me, but this is my opinion, and I respect your right to disagree. I'm sure many people will call me cruel, heartless, ignorant, and many other things. I am by no means an expert on the topic, but I do have an opinion, and I feel that it is an opinion that isn't often expressed, and that needs to be expressed. I am pro-euthanasia. There, I said it. I know this is probably a shock to many of you. I know it is a very touchy subject. I know that many of you will get really angry at me. I know that many of you will call me a monster. But I believe that I am a loving, caring, compassionate, responsible pet parent, and I will explain why I am pro-euthanasia. I believe that you have an obligation as a pet parent to keep your pet happy and healthy. As a pet parent, you need to take care of your pet's physical, mental, and emotional health. There are so many things that can contribute to the decline in your pet's health, and it is your job to make sure that your pet doesn't suffer. This is where euthanasia comes into play. If you have an animal that is experiencing pain, suffering, andor a drastic decline in quality of life, it is your job to end that suffering. There are many people who believe that you should never euthanize an animal unless they are in severe physical pain. I disagree with this. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal is mentally or emotionally suffering. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal's quality of life is low. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal is declining mentally or emotionally, or is suffering from mental or emotional conditions, such as separation anxiety. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal is declining physically, or is suffering from a physical condition, such as arthritis. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal is declining mentally andor emotionally. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal is declining physically andor emotionally. I think that euthanasia should be used in situations where the animal is suffering from any condition that will affect their quality of life. I think that it is selfish to keep a pet alive if the pet is suffering, whether it be from a physical or mentalemotional condition. I think that it is cruel to allow a pet to continue suffering. I think that it is your job as a pet parent to end your pet's suffering. I think that people tend to keep their pets alive for their own selfish reasons. People tend to keep their pets alive because they are not ready to let their pet go. People tend to keep their pets alive because they are not ready to say goodbye. People tend to keep their pets alive because they cannot accept the fact that their pet is suffering. People tend to keep their pets alive because they are not ready to go through the grieving process. People tend to keep their pets alive because they are not ready to accept that their pet is suffering. People tend to keep their pets alive because they are not ready to accept the fact that their pet is in pain. I think that people tend to keep their pets alive for their own selfish reasons, and that they often forget about their pet's well-being. People often forget to take into consideration their pet's pain and suffering. People often forget to take into consideration their pet's quality of life. People often forget to take into consideration their pet's decline mentally andor emotionally. People often forget to take into consideration their pet's decline physically andor emotionally.

Tsinghua,cmv-196,"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced with the fact that I am a conservative. I believe in limited government, the free market, and individual liberty. However, I have a hard time seeing how anyone can seriously say that a person who has already been convicted of a crime is ""unfit"" for voting. Somehow, that is more a symptom of the person's moral character than their ability to understand the nuances of the issues. While it may be true that a convicted felon has a difficult time getting an education, finding employment, and even becoming a productive member of society, I am not sure how that equates to them being ""unfit"" for voting. Yes, some people have said that convicted felons should not be able to vote, because they were convicted of a crime. However, if someone is convicted of a crime, it does not mean that they are incapable of understanding the issues, and that is not a valid reason to disenfranchise them from voting. I am also not a fan of disenfranchising anyone for their sexual orientation. I believe that there are some circumstances in which people should be able to legally marry and have children, but I am not sure how it can be determined if someone is ""fit"" to vote. If you are a heterosexual man or woman, you have the same potential to do great things as anyone else. It is certainly not a requirement that you have a college degree, and it is certainly not a requirement that you be employed or that you have a good job. It is certainly not a requirement that you be a productive member of society. But what does it mean to be a ""productive member of society""? Is it the same as being a ""productive citizen""? No, I don't think so. There are some people who may be ""productive members of society,"" but are not ""productive citizens."" But that doesn't mean that they should not be allowed to vote. It is a bit more complicated than that, because there are some people who may not have a college degree, but are still ""productive members of society"" and can still do great things. I don't think that we should be able to tell someone that they are not ""fit"" to vote because they are a heterosexual male or female. I think that we should have the right to vote, regardless of our sexual orientation. I am not saying that I would not vote for someone because they are a homosexual. I have never voted for a candidate because they were a homosexual. I am saying that I believe that a person should not be allowed to vote because of their sexual orientation. I don't think that this is an issue of ""the right to vote"" or ""the right to not vote,"" but rather it is an issue of the right to not be discriminated against. I don't think that it is fair that people who have done wrong are ""unfit"" to vote, but people who have done no wrong should not be ""fit"" to vote. I think that we need to stop discriminating against people on the basis of their sexual orientation. I believe that we should not be able to tell people that they are ""unfit"" to vote because they are a homosexual. Yesterday I was on a very interesting conversation about ""Christians"" and ""being a Christian."" I was talking to a friend who is a member of the Presbyterian Church. He and I have talked about many different issues, but the one issue that he and I agree on is the issue of abortion. I was asked if I would be willing to have a baby if it meant that I would lose my job. I said that I would not, because it is morally wrong to take a life. I have heard a lot of people say that ""I will take care of my baby,"" and that ""it is the woman's body,"" and that ""it is her choice,"" and that ""the baby is God's idea."" These are all arguments that I have heard and I have been told that they are all valid reasons for why women should be allowed to have an abortion. I am not going to go into the different reasons for why I think that it is wrong to have an abortion, but I will say that I think that the arguments used by pro-choice people are not convincing. I do not think that a woman should be able to kill a baby because she thinks that it is God's idea, or because she thinks that it is her body, or because she thinks that it is her choice. I do not think that a woman should be able to kill a baby because it is easier for her to go to work. I do not think that a woman should be able to kill a baby because it will allow her to have a career. I do not think that a woman should be able to kill a baby because it is her body."

Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.' This is why I think that giving the reason'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong. Hello, users of CMV!

Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I feel like I can look at any situation and give an opinion about it, whether you want it or not. I have two younger sisters, so I have had to put up with a lot of crap that I would not have to put up with if I did not have younger sisters. I have seen them cry, laugh, throw tantrums, eat dog food, pee their pants, get bit by the neighbor's dog, and a whole lot of other shit that I would not wish upon any other human being. They have also done plenty of things that could have been prevented, if only someone would have done something. This video was posted on YouTube on May 11th. It shows a little girl, no older than 4, doing a bunch of horrible things to a cat. I'm not sure who the mother of the little girl is, but I think that she should be held accountable for the actions of her daughter. The little girl is standing over a cat and she is saying some pretty bad stuff. She stomps on the cat, throws it against a wall, and chokes it. The mother is standing there laughing and recording the video. You can hear the mother laughing at the little girl and even encouraging her to continue with her actions. I think that it is pretty safe to say that a lot of people would agree that this is animal abuse. I think that it is also safe to say that a lot of people would agree that the mother is encouraging the little girl to continue to abuse the cat. I have read a lot of things from people who think that the mother is an idiot and should be punished in some way. I have read a lot of things from people who say that the cat deserved it because it was bad. I have read a lot of things from people who are just confused about the whole thing. I am not sure what to think about this whole thing. I think that the mom is an idiot for encouraging her daughter to do this stuff to the cat. I think that the cat did not deserve to be treated this way, no matter how bad it was. I think that this could have been prevented if the mother would have been a parent to the little girl. I think that this little girl could have just as easily been doing this to another little girl. I think that the cat is just as innocent as any other person in the room. I am not sure what can be done about this. I do not think that anything can be done to the little girl, because she is too young to understand the whole thing. I do not think that anything can be done to the cat, because the cat is an animal and it can not press charges against anyone. I think that the mother should be charged with child abuse and animal abuse. I think that the mother should be put in jail for some period of time. I think that the mother should also be put on some sort of watch list that keeps her from owning any type of pet in the future. I am sure that there is plenty that can be done to help the little girl and the cat. I think that the little girl needs to see what she did to the cat and be punished for it. I think that the little girl needs to see how the cat responds to her actions and be punished for it. I think that the cat needs to be seen by a veterinarian and any injuries that the cat has received needs to be treated. I think that the cat needs to be given to a foster home, where it will be taken care of properly. I think that this whole thing is a shame. I think that it is a shame that this little girl is being raised like this. I think that it is a shame that this cat is being treated like this.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-197,"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person who loves to read books and see films for entertainment purposes only (and because it helps pass time). If you take pleasure watching horror flicks like The Exorcist or Poltergeists than go ahead! But if your taste leans more towards something along those lines of Saw etc...than maybe these types are best avoided by just being too intense? I do think there is an intrinsic problem with many mainstream film makers today which they fail miserably at depicting functioning human beings; rather strange considering how much money movies generate worldwide every year - but hey ho what can we expect as long people keep buying tickets en masse?! So why then would anyone want their children exposed over-night into such things when real life could become so nightmarish itself due its own sheer unpredictability alone?? Also consider all other non mediated ways one might fill ones mindsenses on TV shows radio programs: music videos news coverage focus chiefly around violence anyway!! Films have always been regarded superior intellectually though aren't necessarily funnier [the exception perhaps possibly Porky's]. When was last heard anything say against violent documentaries beeing shown ""just once""? What happened after 9 11 didn't exactly change anybody minds here either.. Ahhh don t get my wrong nor claim i'm suggesting replacing popcorn munching amusement methods altogether - oh no! It seems most parents themselves may even agree wholeheartedly except where morality comes involved.

BigScience,cmv-197,"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person when it comes to my children and their activities (not just with regards to movies). And if you are looking for an argument here, then go ahead. I would like to be clear: I don't think kids should have access to these sorts of videos at all times without adult supervision or censorship. That's probably the most important thing I'll say here...and it's the one I'm going to focus on because that's what people seem to want to hear. But why? Why do we need to ban them? Well, let's take a step back; look at our society today as a whole. In order for us to function properly, we must be able to: This list is pretty long. The only problem being that almost none of those items actually exist outside the home environment unless you're living in an isolated community where there aren't many other adults around. You can't really skip watching ""Family Guy"" or ""Dickinson's Chocolates"" while trying to raise your own kids! The internet has allowed us to bypass some of these restrictions by creating social networks that allow users to create separate worlds online instead of having Facebook, Twitter and MySpace become part of everyone else's normal life within real time. (MySpace was once considered the gold standard for teen chatting.) These virtual communities allow youngsters to interact freely with each other and escape into another world altogether. They also give parents less control over what's happening outside their homes. While the Internet has certainly done its job of allowing us to live more independently and thus free ourselves up for a few hours during the day missing work andor school, sometimes that freedom can backfire. Kids get involved too easily in things they shouldn't and begin to misuse the technology available through our modern lives. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - but it's something to keep an eye out for so that you know exactly how far you're letting your kids explore themselves. In addition to using the web-cams which allow you to see who visits your pages, we've seen sites such as YouTube start experimenting with uploaded video games! The site itself allows anyone to upload short clips showing ""how-to"" instructions on specific computer programs such as Flash. While the clip often doesn't show much skill on display, there's no doubt that it's still technically illegal to use these songs or images under 18 years old. Even if the game maker didn't intend to violate copyright law, it's always possible that someone could accidentally insert a link pointing to a sex tape somewhere inside the program. I've heard stories of younger teens who've broken into someone's house via MacBook Airs that had been left turned on overnight! Obviously a family member missed turning the computer back off after leaving it unattended. Shouldn't these kinds of events happen eventually even though they're prohibited by laws designed specifically against such situations? (If you've ever wondered whether your kid might try and break into your business, I'd recommend reading ""The Hidden Lies"" before continuing.) It seems obvious to cut back on media usage due to safety concerns, but did you know that playing certain types of violent video games may cause neurological damage in pre-teens and adolescents? (Source: Scientific American) Pornography-wise, admittedly I don't agree with pornographers and others (including myself) who claim that viewing sexually explicit material promotes greater sexual confidence. However, the fact remains that although this kind of stuff alone will never lead directly to increased libido, exposure does increase sensitivity to erotic stimulation and therefore potential arousal later down the road. For example, research shows that men exposed to nude females earlier in childhood tend to masturbate more frequently than men whose mothers refused to read erotica, indicating that early visual encouragement increases desire. Obviously it's better that kids learn about healthy relationships rather than getting ripped apart by harsh reality TV or sub-standard music videos, but surely we're taking enough risks already?! If my child sees two women kissing on television tonight, what happens tomorrow morning when he hears his mommy talking dirty to her boyfriend behind him...? Or right next door...? It's true that it's hard to monitor everything that goes onto the Web nowadays, especially given the number of films and pictures which are posted daily. Aside from keeping tabs on what sort of websites your child checks regularly to avoid malicious content, block direct access to specific keywords or phrases whenever necessary. That said... Why limit your child's ability to watch anything they choose to? Sure, maybe restricting their options won't help curb inappropriate behavior, but it'll definitely make it easier to teach good values and build character. It's very easy for parents to assume that everything that appears at the bottom of a search engine results page is automatically OK since that's generally the case. I've heard stories of friends' kids checking pornographic sites as soon as they saw porn stars appear across the screen! In today's society, nothing gets past Google fast enough. But hey! Things haven't changed that drastically. Remember when I explained that it wasn't uncommon for 13-year-old boys to sit down straight away and write poetry? Nowadays, some kids decide to turn on MTV as soon as they wake up; there are countless scenarios like that. No longer are parents"
Tsinghua,cmv-197,"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I will say this; I do not feel that the NFL has been too hard on the Steelers. The league has been a bit too soft on the Ravens, in my opinion. As I have said before, I am not saying that Baltimore is perfect, but there are many other teams that do the same things that they do, and they do not get the same treatment that the Ravens do. You know what? I will say this, the NFL is a business, and it is all about money. The NFL has put the onus on the Steelers to play harder and have more energy on the field, and to be more passionate. The league has put this onus on them, and the players have accepted this onus. That is not to say that the players do not know what they are getting themselves into, and that they do not know what they are agreeing to, but I will say that it is not all their fault. They are playing for a team that is paid millions of dollars by the league to produce a product. The players are in a situation where they are being paid millions of dollars by the league, and are being asked to do things that they do not want to do. That is a tough situation to be in, and I will say this, the players should be able to express their displeasure in a constructive way. I know that they are not allowed to talk about it on the field, but the NFL has also made it very clear that they can express their displeasure by kneeling. I have not seen one player on the Steelers that has kneeled on the field. There are a lot of Steelers fans out there that would love to see the players take a knee, but I do not see it happening. The Steelers have made it very clear that they do not want to have this conversation on the field. The Steelers have made it very clear that they are not going to protest on the field. If the Steelers want to protest, they will protest off the field. The Steelers have the right to protest. I know that a lot of people do not like that, but I think it is a good thing. The players have the right to express their displeasure, and it is not my place to tell them that they can not do that. If they want to kneel, they can kneel. If they want to sit, they can sit. They are paying millions of dollars to be in the NFL, and they are being paid to play a game. The game is all about entertainment, and it is the players job to sell that entertainment. I think that they have been given a little bit too much leeway. The players have not really been fined for any of this. The league has been very lenient with the players, and I think that is the wrong approach. The players should be fined for this. They should be fined for their actions, and the league should make it very clear that they are not going to put up with this kind of nonsense. This is not the way to sell a product. You can protest, but you can do it in a way that does not put the players in a bad light. I think that the NFL is making a big mistake by not being more strict with the players. You know what? The NFL has been making a big mistake by allowing the players to do what they are doing. The NFL has to do something to show that they are not going to put up with this."
Tsinghua,cmv-198,"I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to stop all industrial activity, to stop all manufacturing, to stop all the infrastructure that we currently have, and we would need to start doing that immediately. And there are some reasons why I think that's not possible. One of them is that we have, you know, these things called human beings. And they're not just stupid, you know. They have all sorts of complex, and I think it's very reasonable to say that we would need a very large political and social change to get people to actually do that. And I think we're, we're probably not there yet. But we're not that far off, either. It's not like we're on the other side of the fence, and we're looking back at where we were. I think we're just, we're a few steps away from it. And I think we need to think about it, and I think that's why I wrote this book. You know, if we have a very long, long time horizon, then we might be able to wait until people come to their senses, and they'll do what we need to do. But the longer we wait, the more expensive it is. So I think that we need to think about that. It's not an easy question. I think it's a very, very important question. And I think we need to think about it, and I think it's a very important book. When you were in the process of writing it, did you have a sense of the impact of this kind of work, or the impact of the work that you did on the environmental issues that you did? Did you have a sense of that? No, I think that we're still very much in the dark. I mean, the only time that I felt that I was making an impact was when I went to India, and I saw the most fantastic, most amazing places, and people living in absolute poverty. And then when I got home, and I thought about it, and I thought, ""What are we doing?"" And I realized that the only thing we were doing was polluting the air, polluting the water, destroying the forests, destroying the biosphere, destroying the very planet on which we depend. So I realized that we had to make a change, and we had to do it immediately. But when I was in India, it was very difficult to say, ""What are we doing wrong?"" because we were living in this kind of paradise. And then I came back and I thought, ""What am I doing wrong?"" So I think it's a very, very difficult question, because we can see the consequences of our actions, and we can see that the consequences are bad. But we can't see what we're doing wrong. And I think that's why it's so difficult. When I talk about the sense of urgency, it's very difficult to get people to understand that. You're not trying to change people's minds, right? I'm not trying to change people's minds. I'm trying to change the world. You're trying to get people to act in a way that would have a large impact, and that they would have to change their lifestyle, and that they would have to make a change, right? I think that's what I'm trying to do. You're trying to say, ""Here's the science, here's what we're doing wrong, here's what we need to do."" You're trying to get people to take that on board, and to make that change. So I think that's a very important thing to do, and I think that that's what I'm trying to do. So, what do you think of all the reactions to the book? Do you feel like people are taking it on board, or do you feel like it's a bit too late? Well, I think it's too late. I mean, I think that it's very difficult to say that we're not too late. I mean, I think that the scientists have been saying for years that we're already past the point of no return. And I think that the reason that we're having a difficult time getting people to understand that is that we don't understand that. We think that it's a problem that's going to happen in 10 or 20 years. We don't think it's going to happen in 100 or 200 years. We think that we're just, we're just a little bit off, and we're just going to get there, and we're going to do it."
BigScience,cmv-198,"I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to burn a lot of fossil fuels and have extremely high levels of energy efficiency. If you look at how things were before there was CO2 in our atmosphere or global warming trends, it is very hard for us to see any reason why we should be doing anything different. This week's IPCC report has been met with much criticism from outside of government who say no amount of analysis can be trusted until more data becomes available on such elements as the carbon cycle, ice cores and ocean chemistry that will not become clear till two years down the road. This includes scientists whose work has found conclusive evidence that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases have caused temperature increases over the last century, although they disagree exactly what part humans play in those changes. (See also here) One thing I think all this demonstrates however, is that despite some disagreements between experts around the world, which doesn't mean the scientific consensus itself is wrong (see here), the fact remains that we have reached a tipping point - whether we like it or not. The good news though is that if these warnings are taken seriously by governments globally then perhaps ultimately we will find a solution that allows us to live within the limits set out in the science rather than pushing them beyond natural bounds through continued reliance upon oil companies' profits, resource extraction and other methods that threaten humanity's future survival."
OpenAI,cmv-198,"I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to focus on achieving a rapid reduction in global carbon emissions. This would require a significant shift in political, economic, and social systems, as well as individual behavior changes. As a helpful assistant, I would suggest starting with small but significant steps such as reducing personal carbon footprint by using energy-efficient light bulbs, switching to renewable energy, eating a plant-based diet, reducing air travel, and using public transportation, among others. On a larger scale, governments and businesses can invest in renewable energy, promote green transportation, and implement policies to reduce carbon emissions. We can also encourage and pressure them to do so by using our voice and vote. Overall, combating climate change is the responsibility of everyone, and it requires collective and urgent action."

Human,cmv-198,"I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to change our lifestyles in the most dramatic of ways, and we would need to unify and mobilize everybody to address this issue (at the expense of almost everything else). And I believe that it's too late for us to do this because it would take changes so dramatic that the people who are most invested in society as it is today (the rich and powerful) would resist it will everything they have. A lack of serious committments and changes is indicative of this. I believe that we are on the brink of a number of tipping points, if we haven't already passed them: The melting of the polar ice caps (including rain at polar areas and the landslide effect of snowmelt destabilizing ice sheets causing them to break up plunge into the ocean well before they would even melt) meaning that the sheets which used to reflect sunlight away from the Earth will be gone. Along with that is the albedo flip where as the ice melts and pools of water accumulate on the top of ice sheets, they become a sort of heatsink, absorbing solar energy and causing nearby ice to melt, creating further pools of water. The melting of frozen methane escaping into the atmosphere is a similar effect which will cause another feedback loop as methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas, in orders of magnitude (is it 40x?) above carbon dioxide. Oceanic acdification threatening to grind not only oxygen production to a virtual standstill but also threatening to destroy the very foundation of oceanic life by removing the ability for the cornerstone of the oceanic foodchain, phytoplankton, to form. If this happens, then the natural cycle of nutrients from the oceans to the waterways back to the land will come to a grinding halt, meaning that the once rich and fertile liminal lands along coastlines will become barren and waterways will end up eutrophying and becoming undrinkable. The destruction of peat bogs andor the reduction of the capacity of peat bogs to keep the carbon they contain sequestered. Runaway forest fires causing feedback loops as the hotter and drier the world gets, the more likely severe forest fires will be which will in turn increase the carbon in the atmosphere. The potential for rainforest ecosystems to collapse thereby increasing atmospheric carbon while ceasing to function as carbon sinks. Desertification rapidly increasing due to increased temperatures and reducederratic rainfall thereby reducing plant life and the ability for ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide. The potential for climate change to affect the ability of cloud formation and water vapor to reflect sunlight. But the biggest factor in all of this, and the one tipping point which we have already passed is this one the social tipping point. (Granted this is hypothetical and I admit that it's difficult to argue against speculation and prognostication.) What I see as the social tipping point is the part where people stop caring because they feel entirely powerless to affect any change, where governments choose not to act for leverage (politicalfinancial etc.), where governments and corporations choose not to act in order to preserveincrease profits, where the food supply gets put under more pressure due changes in climate (extremes, predictability, rainfall etc.) and so people will be less interested in eating locally or sustainably and more interested in just trying to get enough food, where electricity usage will skyrocket as people try to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors while it's either baking or freezing outside, where we will be faced with increasingly severe humanitarian crises (water shortages, coastal flooding, islands being submerged, famines etc.), where wars over resources will only increase, and the sum of these social feedback loops will cripple our ability to focus on ways to address runaway climate change because we will be dealing with other more urgent issues that cannot be ignored. The reason that I believe we have passed this so-called social tipping point is because collectively we have not only failed to halt carbon emissions, but instead we have only been increasing them. If there were hope for us to achieve serious change in order to avert catastrophic climate change, it would be indicated by the countries of the world rallying to make carbon emissions simply plateau. But we can't even do that. So I believe that it's too late for the world to not only stop the increase of carbon emissions, but that it's too late to be able to bring about the dramatic changes in lifestylesliving standards etc. required to avoid either increasing carbon emissions (which is a catastrophe) or simply halting carbon emissions where they are right now (which is a catastrophe). And I think that as we have surpassed this social tipping point, it will cause feedback loops in society as well as in the environment which will push us increasingly faster down a path of catastrophic climate change. N.B.: I'm not saying that humans are fundamentally incapable of changing the way they live their lives and their environmental impact. I'm not saying that life will be extinguished altogether, in fact I'm not even saying that humans as a species won't survive, but I'm saying that our societies and our progress almost certainly will not survive. I'm not saying that if we all pulled together and put everything we had into averting catastrophic climate change we couldn't stop it. I'm not saying that a revolution that sweeps the globe and changes the fundamental nature of the way society organizes itself around production, consumption, and our relation to the environment couldn't stop this. And I'm not saying that there won't be the potential for some miracle techno-fix that will save everything in the eleventh hour. I'm saying that for us to have anything more than the most infinitesimally small chance that we might be able to save ourselves from climate change somehow that we would need to have already made big strides on this front, and the way that the world is geared means that we are effectively stuck barrelling towards catastrophic climate change in an ever-accelerating manner and that this is demonstrated by us not being able to put the brakes on now, and that's without even trying to put it into reverse (to overstretch the metaphor). Please, please change my view. Edit: View changed! [This comment] made me realize that big changes could be brought about through a number of ways without the climate getting so bad that we'd need to be neck deep in seawater. I'm still skeptical that we'll be able to pull it off, and I still think that there are a ton of hazards that our current economic system presents us with which we will need to address, but if the circumstances were right (e.g. strong carbon taxes, ratifying the Kyoto treaty, a functional emissions trading market etc.) we really could reduce carbon emissions as well as atmospheric carbon in a practical and realistic way that would avert catastrophic climate change. In another comment there's a link to a recent rscience AMA on climate change which addressed how I was buying into alarmism when the reality doesn't actually seem quite so dire when you look at the evidence. At least not yet anyway. Between those two comments in particular, my view has been changed."
OpenAI,cmv-199,I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm assuming this person is sexually active). I'm concerned about their behavior and the potential risks they are exposing themselves to. What can I do to help them make safer choices?
Human,cmv-199,"I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm keeping this purposefully gender-neutral to avoid a biased response). They didn't massively like any of the partners as people, they just wanted to have sex. Which is fine. I love sex, and I think it's great, but I could never feel okay with having that many sexual partners in such a short space of time. I can't help but feel that there must be something deeply broken about someone who IS okay with it. Either they're very insecure and in need of some sort of validation, or they have no respect for themselves and a very low sense of self-worth. Change my view please! Hello, users of CMV!

I'm 23 and I've slept with 22 people in the last year. I know that I'm in the minority, but I think it's a little ridiculous. Why do I feel the need to go out and have sex? I have a boyfriend and I don't want to cheat on him. I also don't want to cheat on myself. I think I'm in a pretty good place and I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong. What do you think? I think you're being a little too hard on yourself, especially since you have a boyfriend. That said, I'm not sure if you're trying to be honest or you're just uncomfortable. Either way, you don't need to justify your sex life. That's your life, and you have a right to it. Your question is about why you feel the need to go out and have sex, but you also said that you're not doing anything wrong. It's easy to say you don't need to justify yourself, but it's another thing to say that you're not doing anything wrong. Maybe you do need to think about why you feel the need to have sex so much. Are you seeking validation from others or are you just not satisfied with the relationship you have?"
PaLM,cmv-199,"I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm not sure if I believe them, but they seemed pretty proud of it). I'm not really sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, I think it's kind of gross and irresponsible. On the other hand, I guess it's their life and they can do what they want. I'm not really a prude or anything, but I've never been the type of person who sleeps around a lot. I've always been more interested in having a long-term relationship than just hooking up with random people. I guess I just don't see the appeal of sleeping with a bunch of different people. It seems like it would be more trouble than it's worth. But then again, I'm not judging anyone who does sleep around. If that's what they're into, then more power to them. I just don't think it's something that I would ever be interested in doing. I guess I'm just a little bit old-fashioned. I believe in love and commitment. I want to find someone who I can spend the rest of my life with. I don't want to just sleep with a bunch of different people and then move on to the next one. I want to find someone who I can truly connect with on a deeper level. I know that not everyone feels the same way that I do. There are plenty of people who are perfectly happy sleeping around. And that's fine. It's just not for me. I guess I'm just a little bit more selective when it comes to who I sleep with. I want to make sure that I'm with someone who I really care about and who I can see myself having a future with. I don't want to just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I want to sleep with someone because I love them and I want to be with them. I know that I'm not the only one who feels this way. There are plenty of other people out there who are looking for something more meaningful than just a one-night stand. We're the ones who want to find love and commitment. We're the ones who want to find someone to spend the rest of our lives with. So if you're one of those people, then don't give up. There are plenty of other people out there who feel the same way you do. Just keep looking and you'll eventually find someone who you can truly connect with."
BigScience,cmv-199,"I have a few friends who sleep around a lot.

They said it was just about getting off and people were down to hook up if I wasn't interested. Not sure what they're looking for but probably nothing serious since they aren't rushing anything or planning on being intimate anyway. My read is, there are plenty of reasons why someone would cheat not because them wanting sex all the time What kind of talk is this? So when you make your plans do you want the girlfriend involved in these things? The whole point of having an open relationship is so that neither person has any expectations as far as commitment goes. If one wants something more than simply dating then it's their choice how many partners they can date at once without feeling guilty."
LLAMA,cmv-199,"I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm not sure if that was all men or if it included both men and women). I find that to be a ridiculously high number. The vast majority of people I've spoken to have told me that it is entirely unreasonable to expect to be able to have sex with someone every day or so for an entire year. And yet, this person seems to be doing it. I have a few friends who seem to have a new sexual partner every few days. I'm not sure if these people are just lucky or if they have some sort of secret for how to pick up so many sexual partners. I'd really like to know if they do. I think it is a personal choice. If I had 6 people in two weeks, I would be concerned about the amount of STDs that I could get. However, if you're using protection, then I would say go for it. You can always get tested for STDs at the beginning of each month. I think it's fine as long as you're being safe. I can't believe they've done it with 6 people. I don't think I've even done it with 6 people in the past year. I have a friend who's a pretty high profile person and gets a lot of action. I think it's fine if you're being safe. If you're going to have multiple partners, then you need to be safe. I've seen some of these people on TV who have slept with hundreds of people. I think it's ridiculous. I think it's better to have a small number of sexual partners, rather than a large number. I'm not sure how this person has found 6 people to sleep with in the past 2 weeks. I've had a hard enough time finding one person to sleep with in the past two weeks. I think it's better to sleep around a lot and have a lot of partners. I like the idea of sleeping with as many people as I can. I have a lot of friends who are in the same boat. Sleeping with so many people seems like it would be incredibly exhausting. I'm not sure how these people are doing it. I would find it to be incredibly tiring to sleep with so many people. I don't think I would be able to sleep with that many people in a year, let alone two weeks. Admin - I would find that to be tiring, too. I like the idea of having multiple partners, but I would find it exhausting to have so many in such a short period of time. I think it is totally up to you. Some people are comfortable sleeping with a lot of people while others only like to sleep with a small number of people. I would rather have a small number of partners, but I think you should do whatever makes you happy. As long as you are being safe, then you should do what you want."

BigScience,cmv-200,"[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out why there is so much debate about how to approach ""gold standards"" in terms of quantifying improvements in patient care. I am particularly interested in two papers that focus on use of clinical information systems, specifically EHRs (electronic health records). The first one was entitled ""Evaluating electronic medical record adoption: Current practices and problems, implications for research and policy"" by John Topa et al. (2006) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. This paper examines what factors can lead clinicians and administrators toward or away from gaining access to an EHR system - their assessment included six dimensions including efficiency- effectiveness; organizational structure; credentialing; workflow support; decision making support; and privacy concerns. The second paper examined whether clinician satisfaction with an existing HIE would be positively related to physician participation rates in interoperable health informatics activities among a sample of physicians within five Northeast states' networks. The study involved data collected through surveys administered between 2004-2006 using semistructured interviews as well as more in-depth notes taken during the open ended portion of each interview session by four trained researchers. It was reported in this paper that: ""Ichthyosis vulgaris is defined as multiple discrete areas of hyperkeratosis and scaling in any part of body surface...It occurs mainly in immunocompromised children such as transplant recipients and patients treated immunosuppressant drugs..In spite of severe symptoms, it may rarely occur without any skin lesions appearing. Ichthyosiform erythroderma has similar appearance but involves all over body surfaces rather than limited sites. All these conditions are characterized by epidermal thickening due to abnormal keratinization. Hyperlipidemia leads to dysregulation of cell cycle regulation causing production of abnormal amount of keratins resulting into formation of plaques, pustules etc"""
Tsinghua,cmv-200,"[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out the issues. It seems that many critics of progressives and liberals don't really understand how a progressive society is supposed to work. They're not proposing to return to the good old days of the 1950s and 1960s. It is clear that we have an economic system that doesn't work. In my book I show how the wealth gap between the haves and have-nots has been widening for decades, but how the media doesn't want to talk about it. It's a mystery to me why we're not talking about the fact that people are working longer hours for lower wages, and why we don't talk about the fact that the rich have been getting richer and the poor have been getting poorer. In my book I lay out what progressives believe, and how to get there. You can't just go back to the way things were. If we're going to get to a progressive society, we need to change the system. We need to take back the power that corporations have and put it in the hands of the people. We need to change the tax system so that the richest people and corporations pay their fair share. We need to eliminate income inequality. We need to fix our broken education system so that all children have a good education. We need to end the war on drugs and end the war on terror. And we need to end the culture of violence. We need to end the war on the poor, the war on women, the war on gays and lesbians, the war on people of color. And, as you know, we need to abolish the death penalty. The whole country is waking up to the fact that we have a problem. Increasingly, people are starting to talk about how we can fix the system. I think we're going to get there. We're going to get there because the American people are fed up with being held down. They want to have a better life.

Human,cmv-200,"[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic. I believe that: 1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense. 2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself andor your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision. I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun. But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun. I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety. Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

LLAMA,cmv-200,"[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out a case for why I was wrong. I'm not convinced but it's a more well-argued case than I've seen before, and it points out some obvious weaknesses in the logic behind the statistics in [the first article]. If you read through the second article, the one criticizing the stats, you'll see that the author is relying on a rather circular argument that, essentially, if the stats say that there's a problem, the problem isn't real. The core of the argument seems to be that because more women are going to college, more women are in the workforce, and so more women are going to be reporting assaults. That this statistic is not a reflection of more women being assaulted, it's a reflection of more women being able to report assaults. The problem with this argument is that it fails to acknowledge that more women reporting assaults is the best possible outcome. Sure, maybe you can argue that it's not fair that men are more likely to commit sexual assault than women, but it's not fair that it's hard to prove sexual assault either. It's not fair that it's hard to come forward as a victim of sexual assault. But that's the reality. And if we can't make it any easier to come forward, then the best thing we can do is to make it harder to commit sexual assault. Ultimately, it's a question of whether we want to focus on the problem (too many sexual assaults), or the symptom (more women reporting sexual assaults)."
PaLM,cmv-200,"[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out some of the main criticisms. The author of [this article] argues that the statistics used in [the original article] are misleading because they don't take into account the fact that people who are incarcerated are more likely to be poor and have less education than the general population. They also argue that the statistics don't take into account the fact that people who are incarcerated are more likely to be convicted of crimes that are more likely to result in long prison sentences. I find some of these criticisms to be convincing. For example, it is true that people who are incarcerated are more likely to be poor and have less education than the general population. This means that the statistics used in [the original article] are not necessarily representative of the entire population. Additionally, it is true that people who are incarcerated are more likely to be convicted of crimes that are more likely to result in long prison sentences. This means that the statistics used in [the original article] are not necessarily representative of the entire range of criminal offenses. However, I also find some of the arguments in [this article] to be unconvincing. For example, the author argues that the statistics used in [the original article] are misleading because they don't take into account the fact that people who are incarcerated are more likely to be repeat offenders. However, I believe that this is a valid statistic to consider. Repeat offenders are more likely to commit crimes again, and therefore they are more likely to be incarcerated. This means that the statistics used in [the original article] are still relevant, even if they don't take into account the fact that people who are incarcerated are more likely to be repeat offenders. Overall, I find that the criticisms in [this article] are both convincing and unconvincing. I believe that the statistics used in [the original article] are still relevant, even if they don't take into account all of the factors that the author of [this article] raises. However, I also believe that the author of [this article] raises some valid points that should be considered when interpreting the statistics used in [the original article]. In conclusion, I believe that the statistics used in [the original article] are still valid, but they should be interpreted with caution. The author of [this article] raises some valid points that should be considered when interpreting these statistics."

LLAMA,cmv-202,"As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring the milk first, gives the cereal time to soak up the milk and become slightly soggy before I add more milk to make the final dish. I've also been told that it's healthier to pour milk first, since the cereal and milk mix more evenly. Is there any truth to either of these beliefs? I don't know about the health aspect of it, but I do know that it's better to put the cereal in first, because if you put the milk in first, you'll have to add more milk than if you had put the cereal in first. The amount of milk that you put in before the cereal is the perfect amount for the cereal. It does have to do with the physics of the cereal. There is something called a ""angle of repose."" It means the maximum angle at which a material can rest on a horizontal plane without sliding. In this case, it is the maximum angle at which the cereal can stand up on the side of the bowl before it falls. If you put the cereal in first, the angle of repose is about 70 degrees. If you put the milk in first, it is about 80 degrees. If you look at the image below, you can see how the two angles are different. This means that if you put the cereal in first, you can pour the milk in at an angle that is more than 70 degrees and it will not fall over. However, if you put the milk in first, you can only pour the cereal in at an angle that is less than 80 degrees. What does this mean? It means that if you put the milk in first, you need to pour it in a much gentler fashion than if you put the cereal in first, because you need to pour it in at an angle of less than 80 degrees. If you put the milk in first, you need to pour it in more gently than if you put the cereal in first. So, if you put the milk in first, you will use more milk than if you put the cereal in first. It is for this reason that people always say that you should put the cereal in first. This answer is also a little bit incorrect. The proper way to put the cereal and milk in the bowl is to put the cereal in first, but not completely filling the bowl, then pouring the milk over the cereal. The reason for this is that the cereal and the milk do mix more evenly this way. The reason for this is because the milk is denser than the cereal, and so the cereal will always settle to the bottom of the bowl, and the milk will always settle to the top of the bowl. This is why when you pour the cereal and the milk in the bowl at the same time, the milk will always settle to the top of the bowl, and the cereal will always settle to the bottom of the bowl. If you want the milk and cereal to mix more evenly, you need to put the cereal in first, but not completely filling the bowl, then pour the milk over the cereal. This way, the cereal will not have time to settle to the bottom of the bowl, and the milk will not have time to settle to the top of the bowl. I don't know about the health aspect of it, but I do know that it's better to put the cereal in first, because if you put the milk in first, you'll have to add more milk than if you had put the cereal in first. I don't think this is true. I add milk to the bowl first, and then the cereal. I don't add more milk after the cereal is in the bowl. My wife, however, will add the cereal first and then add milk. I will say, ""Honey, you're doing it wrong,"" but she still continues to do it her way. I've been doing it her way for years and she is right. I thought putting milk in first would make it soggy but I was wrong. By the time you finish eating, it has enough time to soak up the milk. I used to think it would be soggy the whole time. It's not. I thought"
BigScience,cmv-202,"As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring the liquid first is an art form in itself. I live by the book: The more you prepare your food beforehand (and it goes without saying), the better it'll taste. It makes me feel like I'm taking some credit for it. The only time we drink wine or beer during breakfast has to be if we're having French toast with maple syrup on top. Otherwise, we'll probably have tea or coffee instead. (And let's not forget how many times we've drank soda throughout our lives! We seem to go through bottles of water every day.)

PaLM,cmv-202,"As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring the milk first allows the cereal to absorb the milk evenly, resulting in a more enjoyable eating experience. There are a few other reasons why I pour the milk first. First, I like to be able to see how much milk I'm using. If I pour the cereal first, it's difficult to tell how much milk I need to add. Second, I like to be able to control the consistency of my cereal. If I pour the cereal first, then the milk will dilute the cereal and make it too watery. By pouring the milk first, I can add as much or as little milk as I want to get the perfect consistency. Finally, I pour the milk first because I think it tastes better. When the cereal is dry, it has a more pronounced flavor. When the cereal is wet, the milk dilutes the flavor and makes it less intense. By pouring the milk first, I can enjoy the full flavor of my cereal. I know that some people think it's weird to pour the milk before the cereal, but I don't care. I've been doing it my way for as long as I can remember, and I'm not going to change now. If you're a textural eater like me, then I encourage you to give pouring the milk first a try. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it. Here are a few tips for pouring the milk first:  Use a measuring cup to measure the amount of milk you need. This will help you to control the consistency of your cereal.  Pour the milk slowly so that it has time to absorb into the cereal. This will help to prevent the cereal from becoming soggy.  Enjoy your cereal!"

However, if you're interested in trying a new approach, you could experiment with pouring cereal before milk and see if you prefer the result."

However, they sure do like to judge the way I like to prepare my cereal.

EDIT: Thanks to all the people that posted replies. To be honest, I don't know if my view has completely changed, but I definitely recognize the validity of cereal first. It seems that it is a more efficient to obtain the ""perfect milk to cereal ratio."" However, I think that is all due to preference and for those that don't really know how much milk or cereal they want. I guess the best way I can explain my own preference for milk first is similar to soup. I pour the soup in before adding croutons or something.

I believe that pouring milk before cereal will improve the texture of the cereal. Is this correct? Is it? A: The only thing that can possibly make cereal better is more cereal. I have a few thoughts on this subject. Cereal is pretty good. The starches in it are already cooked and the milk has already mixed them up. What you're adding is flavor. You're not changing the texture at all. Cereal, as it is, is fine. If you want to improve the texture of cereal, add more cereal. There are some cereals that are coated with some sort of crunchy coating, but this isn't really an improvement. If you're looking for a new cereal, I'd suggest adding some other type of food that would be better with milk. You could add peanut butter or some type of fruit. A: There is no evidence that this is better, however it may help in the event of a power outage. If you don't have electricity, your fridge may be unable to keep milk cold, which will make it go off. If your fridge is broken and the milk goes off, it may spoil before you are able to cook it."

Fatty foods should also be banned for children because it makes them fat and does nothing else.

My biggest problem with Dr. Oz's advice has always been his suggestion surrounding weight loss - I've never understood why anyone would suggest cutting back on calories while still consuming large portions of carbohydrates. I suspect he doesn't have enough medical training to understand how insulin works so completely flips whatever scientific rationale he uses against itself. All the diets I've tried since starting college were based around low-carbohydrate andor high protein nutrition styles; I'm certain those principles must apply to people who struggle with diabetes as well. I've found the same thing, Christie...that if you're going out to dinner all alone it's fine to almost ""eat"" anything until your stomach fills up-then that's exactly what happens! I'll try my best to cut down on calorie intake where possible, but will probably just give up desserts. However, unless there's an available salad bar nearby, then I'll definitely NOT order a salads... You know, I do agree about smoking- it's really bad for you. But I don't see a big difference between smoked salmon and spam - both contain nitratesnitrites which I would guess might cause cancer...but doesn't one taste more than the other? There was a time when I'd felt guilty buying sweets! Now I'm pretty sure they wouldn't go near me! But I've learned through trial and error that there's only so many times one could ruin chicken breast before calling it garbage - luckily we've discovered ways to use leftovers: We had some bacon livers left from our Thanksgiving feast last night, and we put them on top of some mashed potatoes... Most recently though, yesterday I made ""Cheese Soup"" using smashed-up croutons, tomatoes, cheese, beans, and seasonings..the soup turned out tasty, even several people thought it looked good."

PaLM,cmv-203,"I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say it's relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a cigarette? And what about all the health problems that come with smoking? Cigarettes are one of the leading causes of preventable death in the world. They cause cancer, heart disease, stroke, and many other health problems. Chewing tobacco is also very harmful. It can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, and esophagus. It can also lead to gum disease and tooth loss. In addition to the health risks, smoking and chewing tobacco are also very expensive. A pack of cigarettes can cost up to $10, and a can of chewing tobacco can cost even more. This money could be better spent on things like food, clothing, or education. There are also many social costs associated with smoking and chewing tobacco. Smokers and chewers are more likely to be unemployed, have lower incomes, and live in poverty. They are also more likely to have problems with their relationships and their children. For all of these reasons, I believe that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. They are harmful to our health, our wallets, and our society. We would be better off without them. Some people argue that outlawing cigarettes and chewing tobacco would infringe on our personal freedoms. They say that adults should be able to make their own decisions about what they put in their bodies. However, I believe that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from harm. Cigarettes and chewing tobacco are harmful, and the government should do everything it can to keep them out of our reach. I know that outlawing cigarettes and chewing tobacco would be a difficult task. There would be a lot of opposition from the tobacco industry and from smokers themselves. However, I believe that it is worth it. We need to protect our health, our wallets, and our society from the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco."

When you get older you will realize that there is so much more to life than smoking. If you do decide to quit, I suggest that you get a good supply of patches and gum to help you along. You might also want to try the swish method of quitting. This is what worked for me. It will take time, but you will see results. Be patient and keep trying. Hang in there, and good luck!:D Hi all, I have quit smoking for 2 years now, and am very happy about it. I know a lot of people say that it's easy, but I was never really that successful at it. But I can tell you that the biggest thing that helped me was making a plan, and sticking to it. I had my goal, and I had a plan of how I was going to do it. I just have to remind myself of that plan each day, and stick to it. The thing that really helped me was that I quit cold turkey. I don't know how, but I did it. I didn't do any of the 21-day programs, and I didn't have any sort of support system. I just had a goal, and a plan. I knew that I wanted to be healthy, and wanted to be able to breathe again. I have to remind myself of that every day, and that has been the key. The one thing I would tell you is to be patient with yourself. It's going to take time, and it's going to be difficult. But it's worth it. I would also recommend talking to a doctor about it. You might be surprised how much of a difference it can make. I am 16 years old and I have been smoking for about 5 years. I have tried to quit about 10 times. I would try to quit for a couple days, and then I would just go back to smoking. My mom would tell me not to smoke, and I would agree with her. But then I would just go back to smoking. I think the main reason I keep going back to smoking is because I don't really see the point. It doesn't do me any good, and I don't feel like I need it. I would love to quit smoking, but I just don't know how to do it. I know it is hard, and I know that it can be very hard. But I would really like to try to quit smoking. I have to make a plan, and stick to it. But I don't really know how to do that. I have to make a plan of how I am going to quit smoking, and stick to it. I have to tell myself that I am going to quit smoking, and then I have to try to quit. I have to keep going back to the plan, and keep trying. But I don't know how to do that. So, I would really like some help. I know it can be very hard to quit smoking, but I would really like to try. Thank you. Hi everyone, I am new to this forum, and I have a question about smoking. I have been smoking for about 2 months now, and I really don't want to stop. I know that it is bad for you, and I know that it can really hurt you. But I just can't help myself. I can't quit. I just don't want to stop. It's so much fun, and I can't quit. I would really like to stop smoking, but I don't know how to do it. I know that I need to make a plan, and stick to it.

Human,cmv-204,"Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak). Here are my main views 1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him 2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it. 3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms. Important Points The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions. Batman is not equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman. All I am saying is that he bares some level of responsibility for his refusal to stop the Joker. Finally, Batman is not responsible for the people that the Joker killed early on in his career before it became apparent that he could not be contained. Edit If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possibly come to an agreement The only criminal that I am applying this argument to is the Joker. I'm not advocating for Batman to kill anyone else."
OpenAI,cmv-204,"Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who has the capability to stop the rampant crime and corruption in Gotham City. As an AI language model, I don't have a personal opinion or support for vigilante justice. However, it is important to acknowledge and evaluate the effectiveness and ethical implications of someone's actions, including Batman's no-killing policy. While it is commendable that he is committed to preserving life, his refusal to take the life of a criminal has led to their release and subsequent commission of more crimes, putting innocent lives in danger. It's important for individuals, like Batman, who have the power to uphold justice to consider all the consequences of their decisions and find a balance between preserving the lives of criminals and protecting the public."

I know that it said it was an issue with continuity, and he's a Justice League member now so maybe he just got his powers back somehow...but if it says him getting back the ability to kill after killing many in the past I'm pretty sure it's because DC is trying not to break constanty when they assign new characters like Superman (the man himself being a contious breaker). Also, aside from that one time where they killed off some of their heroes for story purposes way back before the superhero movement, we've had superheroes since well before comics were even invented- how could you possibly say that adding more villains using existing characters as models can't be considered breaking every single character's history?

Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can end this horrific string of tragedies. I am normally very harsh on the writing for the comic because I see the potential for an entertaining comic and I want the comic to reach that potential. This week's comic was an exception. I did not care for the way he ended the story with the ""I have to find a way to live with myself"" line, but I thought the rest of the comic was pretty funny. The plot of the comic was solid, and it had a lot of funny dialogue. I also liked how he kept the punch line hidden until the last panel. I think that is a very effective way to tell a joke. I hope that the writing for the comics continues to improve. As far as the art goes, I liked the idea of the comic. I did not like how the last panel was drawn. There is so much that goes on in the last panel that it is very difficult to focus on one thing. I think that he should have either split the last panel into two panels or simplify the last panel by having only Batman and Alfred in it. The art on the rest of the comic was good, but I did not like the art for the last panel. This week's comic was much better than last week's comic. I give it a 710. I thought the last panel was well done. The focal point is Alfred, and everything else is just background and doesn't need to be focused on. The joke is that Alfred is being tortured, and that's the only thing that needs to be seen. I agree with the last two posters. The idea of the comic is nice, but the artwork was just too much. It's difficult to understand what's going on with so much stuff going on. I've been reading this comic for years, and I've never really cared for it. This week was an exception. The idea was brilliant, and the artwork was spot on. This week's comic was a very well executed comic. I am glad that I read it. I liked the comic this week. I liked how he was able to make a joke about the Batman movies without making a joke about the death of Heath Ledger. The artwork was very good. I liked the way he drew the characters and the way he drew the background. I liked this comic. I thought the artwork was very good. The joke was not as good as the artwork, but it was still a good comic. I liked how he was able to make a joke about Batman without making a joke about the recent death of Heath Ledger. I give the comic an 810."

Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. And we know that he will stop the Joker, because he did it before. Batman is clearly going to be doing something stupid, and he's going to be getting himself killed in the process. It's just a matter of how and when. It's one of the few moments in the movie where the Joker gets a true victory, and I think it's for the best. If Batman didn't get his ass kicked, we'd probably be in for another 20-plus years of comics where Batman beats the Joker up. We don't need that. In the end, I don't think the movie is as good as I had hoped it would be. It's a good movie, but it's not as good as The Dark Knight. I'm also not a big fan of the costume, but that's just me. I think the Joker is one of the best villains in comic book history."

He's a joke, and a very rich one at that. The fact that he is the Republican nominee for president is a travesty, and will result in a devastating loss of democracy in the United States.

The problem with illegal immigration is much more complex than he seems to realize. The man has no foreign policy experience. Boardroom deals with businessmen and bureaucrats from another country does not equate to nation-to-nation diplomacy. His national defense ideas that I've heard seem to amount to, ""more guns and let's tell other countries to screw off."" The Democrats' stance that the rich want to influence policy to get richer does not exclude Donald Trump.

BigScience,cmv-205,"Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate many voters in suburban New Jersey and elsewhere but might well undermine his ability to govern. During those years he worked at the bowels of Wall Street as an analyst for UBS before meeting John Podesta [American Republican Party chairman], and they became close friends. They had lunch together every week. And when Hillary Clinton came along, I mean she was just so difficult to work with that he said 'Let's give this woman one more chance'. And then she ran against him again, and failed badly, which was interesting because her campaign managers were people like Ron Paul's man James Carville - they're really smart and very talented guys. So it's quite clear that Clinton should have been beaten by someone else rather than Donald Trump. Why did you think it wasn't going to happen? You weren't wrong about what his policies are about or even how much trouble he's going to bring...but still? Well, I guess that's always a risk. But if we don't look past these things, you'll be sorry. If you're satisfied with 40 percent of your constituency being happy with you, that doesn't make any sense; certainly not from my point of view. If you've got 20 percent of support, hey! That's fine, we've reached enough people. The rest will follow later on; they'll come around eventually, probably sooner than later. Of course there's always the danger that the other 80 percent won't appear until after November 4. But soon? How often does history repeat itself? Or do we replicate ourselves in terms of our politics, versus something approaching randomness? History repeats itself, sure, there are lots of instances where we're repeating ourselves over time. In recent decades we feel comfortable saying that America has become increasingly polarized politically since Ronald Reagan took office back in 1980. We keep wondering whether we'll ever get out of it... What sort of impact can social media be upon political opinion over such short timescales compared with traditional forms of communication? Yes, absolutely. It's astonishing the speed at which information travels through space and society now days. It seems unbelievable no longer how fast information moves around and flows across borders... I remember putting some questions onto CNN during the London bombings earlier this year and within minutes I'd received thousands of responses. That evening, George Osborne spoke into a microphone at 6pm and five hours later we'd heard dozens of speeches relating to the event. What you see today is simply staggering."

I wonder why he feels the need to constantly put out his own money to buy things with his name on it. He even has a building named after himself in Vegas and he still felt the need to slap his name on it. He's the human equivalent of the guy who buys a new fancy car, gets a new Rolex, and then puts a gold ""TURBO"" sticker on it. I don't care if he was a billionaire or a billion times billionaire. His views are absolutely laughable. What I find interesting is that some people actually consider him a serious candidate. I don't know how anyone can take this guy seriously.

Some argue that these technological advancements can contribute to the reduction of accidents on the road and decrease air pollution. Others may point out potential drawbacks and challenges, such as the need for infrastructure improvements, the cost of implementing new systems, and the potential displacement of jobs.

I know that a system like this is possible, the only thing that is preventing this from happening is that there is no one willing to invest in it, because currently the status quo is too profitable. Everything is a step by step process. I believe we can get rid of cars in the next 30 years. Sorry but this is very unrealistic. I like the idea but it's not practical in the least. You can't change the whole infrastructure of the country just to cater to your desire to get rid of cars. The first step is to not pollute. But again it's not practical to replace a system that currently works with a system that will cost billions, if not trillions to implement. What you need to do is to find a way to make your system work with the current one. I'm not saying that your idea is a bad idea, but you have to look at what you can do now and then work towards the ideal situation. You seem to be confused about what is important. The most important thing is to stop polluting. Even if you change the entire country to be more eco-friendly, you still have to deal with the pollution from other countries. What you should be thinking about is how you can make your system work with the current one. How you can make your system work with the current one. Can you tell me how many cars are in your country? How many miles are there in your country? I don't know the exact numbers, but I know it's not possible to change the whole country to fit your idea. The current system isn't perfect, but it does work. In order to implement your idea, you need to have a system that is just as efficient, but has the added benefit of not polluting. But I agree that the current system isn't perfect. I want to see more research in eco-friendly cars, but I'm also realistic. The reason why companies like Tesla exist, is because there are people who want to buy the cars. It's not just the government who wants cleaner cars. Many people want cars that don't pollute. The reason why companies like Tesla exist, is because there are people who want to buy the cars. It's not just the government who wants cleaner cars. Many people want cars that don't pollute.

You can't just say that we should do away with cars, because that's not feasible in the near future. I'm also realistic. I want cleaner cars, but I know that cars are a part of our society and you can't just get rid of them. The problem isn't with cars, it's with the oil and gas companies.

These technologies are not only expensive to develop and deploy, but they also do not address the root causes of traffic congestion and pollution. Rather than investing in these technologies, we should focus on making our existing public transportation systems more efficient and accessible. We should also invest in infrastructure that encourages people to walk, bike, and take public transportation instead of driving. Here are some of the reasons why I believe that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion:  They are expensive to develop and deploy. The cost of developing self driving cars is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. Even if these cars are eventually able to be produced at scale, they will be prohibitively expensive for most people to own.  They do not address the root causes of traffic congestion and pollution. Self driving cars will still need to use roads, which will lead to more congestion. And even if self driving cars are more fuel efficient than gas powered cars, they will still produce emissions.  They could lead to job losses. Self driving cars could eliminate the need for millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and other transportation workers. This could have a devastating impact on these workers and their families. Instead of investing in self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts, we should focus on making our existing public transportation systems more efficient and accessible. We should also invest in infrastructure that encourages people to walk, bike, and take public transportation instead of driving. Here are some specific things we can do to make our public transportation systems more efficient and accessible:  Increase the frequency of service. One of the biggest complaints about public transportation is that it is too infrequent. We can increase the frequency of service by adding more buses, trains, and streetcars. We can also make it easier for people to transfer between different modes of transportation.  Reduce the cost of fares. Public transportation should be affordable for everyone. We can reduce the cost of fares by providing subsidies or by making it free for certain groups of people, such as low-income individuals and seniors.  Make it easier to use public transportation. Public transportation can be difficult to use, especially for people who are unfamiliar with it. We can make it easier to use public transportation by providing better maps and directions, by making it easier to buy tickets, and by providing more customer service assistance.  Make public transportation more comfortable. Public transportation can be crowded and uncomfortable, especially during rush hour. We can make public transportation more comfortable by providing more seats, by improving air quality, and by making it easier to get on and off of buses and trains. By making our public transportation systems more efficient and accessible, we can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create a more livable city. We can also reduce our dependence on cars, which will help us to fight climate change. In addition to making our public transportation systems more efficient and accessible, we should also invest in infrastructure that encourages people to walk, bike, and take public transportation instead of driving. We can do this by building more sidewalks, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly streets. We can also make it easier for people to get around by bike or on foot by providing more bike share programs and by creating more bike-friendly infrastructure.

The world we live in requires great innovation, but I think the term ""self driving"" has become more of a marketing gimmick rather then it being reality. Today's car buyers have so many choices with features today that it's becoming very difficult to find one that offers what you're looking for as well as at least some value you can appreciate. When buying used vehicles there is no shortage of options to choose from either because new models come out all over every year or they just don't last long enough on consignment dealerships to make them worth much money."
Tsinghua,cmv-206,It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. A safe and clean transportation system should be a first priority. The people should be treated as more important than a mere vehicle to be driven around. Our transportation system needs to be looked at with the eyes of a first responder and the drivers should be considered to be passengers.

Human,cmv-206,"It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. We already have it! It's the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly. We should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute. Some of the points I have against road transport for individuals. Environmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment. Safety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade. Stress- While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers. Energy efficiency - A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars. Maintenance - a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components. Economy - Transportation is lot more expensive in cars. Here are some points that I have for expansion of public transport. Bonus free time - When I'm in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it. Potty Breaks - trains can be modified to have them, cars don't. I'd have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go. Fuel Efficiency. Noise reduction. Skill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer. I am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have today. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

PaLM,cmv-207,"We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been “thin shamed” or “skinny shamed” by another woman. I don’t see how that is possible in American society, where being thin is so highly prized. If anything, thin women are more likely to be envied than criticized. But thin shaming does exist, and it can be just as harmful as other forms of body shaming. It can lead to low self-esteem, eating disorders, and other mental health problems. It can also make it difficult for thin women to find clothes that fit them well. Thin shaming is often rooted in fatphobia, the fear and hatred of fat people. This prejudice is so pervasive in our society that it can even lead thin people to internalize negative messages about their own bodies. They may believe that they are not thin enough, or that they need to lose weight in order to be beautiful. Thin shaming is also a form of misogyny. It reinforces the idea that women’s bodies are objects to be judged and controlled. It tells women that they are not good enough unless they conform to a narrow beauty ideal. We need to challenge the idea that thin is the only acceptable body type. We need to create a more inclusive and body-positive culture where all women can feel beautiful and confident, regardless of their size. Here are some things you can do to help combat thin shaming:  Call out thin shaming when you see it. If you hear someone making a negative comment about a thin person’s body, speak up and let them know that their words are harmful.  Challenge the thin ideal. Talk to your friends and family about the importance of body diversity. Promote positive body images in the media and in your social circles.  Support thin women who are struggling with body image issues. Let them know that they are beautiful and worthy, regardless of their size. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and body-positive culture where all women can feel beautiful and confident."
LLAMA,cmv-207,"We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been ""thin shamed"" or ""skinny shamed"" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, but we have decided to embrace it. The main ways this happens: 1. Someone tells a skinny person that she's lucky to be thin. 2. Someone tells a skinny person that she's small. 3. Someone tells a skinny person that she doesn't know what it's like to be fat. 4. Someone tells a skinny person that she's skinny. 5. Someone tells a skinny person that she's beautiful. All of these things are offensive in American society because everyone has been convinced that they are entitled to be just as beautiful as their more beautiful peers. If they aren't, then it's because of a disease called ""fat."" It's as if the entire country is living in a giant junior high school. Anyways, we have decided to capitalize on this trend and make Thin Shaming the central focus of this website. The most famous person to be thin shamed was, of course, Emily Ratajkowski. Emily got called ""too thin"" because she dared to be thin and popular at the same time. The only thing people should be allowed to do is be fat and popular. Thin shaming is the way of the future."
BigScience,cmv-207,"We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been ""thin shamed"" or ""skinny shamed"" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, but that's just me. I think it can happen under certain circumstances though... if the other person is caring about your health and wants to make sure you're not eating junk food or anything else you shouldn't be (and even then... I'm a little skeptical of people who will say, ""But I'm healthy!"" when their friends are all fat). The main thing with this is definitely getting yourself together - wear what you like, eat whatever foods suit you best, brush your teeth regularly, stop smokingdrinking alcohol etc., and try to find someone to talk to. You can't change others, so perhaps it's worth trying to do these things for yourself as well? This whole blog post has made my stomach churn. I hate being skinny myself no matter how much I've gained weight over the last year. But at 29 years old I really want to feel good in my body even if it means gaining some extra pounds. This doesn't mean I'll go out and starve myself... At least not right now. It's almost always easier said than done when you consider the fact that there are only so many calories we actually need each day! Personally, I wish I'd had an online friend whose opinion was more supportive before making changes. That's one reason why I stumbled into weight loss forums on Facebook recently instead of going straight to blogs. I'm sorry to hear this. It really sucks having low self-esteem around other people; you should know better too. It's also very hard to learn new habits but once you've started doing them consistently they're probably going to become second nature anyway. Also, keep up with exercise your way through life rather than waiting until you're ready to lose weight: it's important to stay strong fit for a long time after you hit your goal! Thanks for sharing your experience here! I agree completely with everything you wrote - especially coming from someone who's already known her own personal struggle with self esteem; both with regards to losing and maintaining a healthy weight. And honestly? Your comments were exactly what my heart needed reading today!! Thanks for posting here!! If you haven't heard, the gypsy curse exists whether its true or not. People believe it and seem to carry it forward. The hold of our past lives affects us in every aspect of our lives including physical appearance and eternal damnation."
Human,cmv-207,"We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been ""thin shamed"" or ""skinny shamed"" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, being a thin woman is a desirable quality. [edit for clarification - having an actual eating disorder is not desirable, but being thin is desirable] This alleged shaming is typically expressed with language such as ""you need to eat something"" or ""do you even eat"" or ""you're so skinny"" or ""you need some meat on your bones"" or ""you need a hamburger."" In all of those cases, the speaker is not criticizing the subject of the speech for being thin. Rather, the speaker is deflecting and express displeasure about the excessive size of her own body relative to the size of the subject's body. In other words, she wishes she was thin and she's just jelly."
OpenAI,cmv-207,"We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been ""thin shamed"" or ""skinny shamed"" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, It is true that thin or skinny shaming may not seem as prevalent or impactful as other forms of body shaming, such as fat shaming or body shape shaming. However, it is still an issue that some people experience and can be hurtful to those affected. Thin or skinny shaming can take many forms, such as commenting on a person's eating habits, implying that they aren't ""real women"" because of their size, or making derogatory remarks about their body. No form of body shaming is acceptable, and everyone should be valued and respected regardless of their size or shape. It is important for people to be kind and supportive of one another and avoid making assumptions or judgments based on appearance."

Human,cmv-208,"The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. If you have a nose that is 2 12 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. However, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. Are you overweight? Your fault. Do you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes? Your fault. Are you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. Do you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. Do you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their ""comfortable""? Your fault. Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. Ladies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. Do you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologneperfume? Your fault. Do you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. Men, do you not shave your unibrownose hair? Your fault. Nearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 1010 but if you are a 210, I firmly believe you can go to a 710. Everyone can be a 710 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics. Also I am not saying being attractive is easy. It takes a lot of work and a lot of self improvement. Finally, this post isn't supposed to make anyone feel good.

As for the rest of it I would say that when you're able to control these things then everything else falls into place. I think one thing about mental health problems like depression and anxiety is they can be triggered by a lot of different factors. For example when someone dies in their family it's impossible to avoid thinking about death as a trigger but maybe that's just me being too dramatic..

LLAMA,cmv-208,"The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. In the case of being disfigured by a fire or an accident, and you have all this scarring, it's not your fault. In the case of being born with facial asymmetry, it's not your fault. It's not that you have to have perfect facial symmetry, but if one of your eyebrows is higher than the other, if one of your eyes is higher than the other, then you're in trouble. Then you need to have the help of a plastic surgeon, and you need to have some surgery to make your face more symmetrical. What I'm going to be talking about today is the idea that when you're ugly, it's your fault. I want to start off by talking about two principles. I call them the two principles of asymmetry, and they're going to be a lot of work. So I'm going to ask you to bear with me. The first principle of asymmetry is that there is no single universal set of standards for attractiveness. There is no one set of standards for what makes a face attractive and what makes a face ugly. There are different sets of standards. To give you an example of that, I want to show you this picture. In this picture, I want you to look at the woman's face, and I want you to think about whether you think her face is attractive or unattractive. I'm going to ask you to rate her on a scale of one to ten, where one is the most unattractive and ten is the most attractive. To give you an idea of how this works, I'm going to show you two examples. In the first example, I'm going to show you a picture of a woman whose face is symmetrical. Then I'm going to show you a picture of a woman whose face is asymmetrical. Then I'm going to ask you to rate the symmetry of these women on a scale of one to ten, where one is perfectly symmetrical and ten is extremely asymmetrical. For both of these women, you can see that they're both attractive and symmetrical. This woman has a rating of 8.8. This woman has a rating of 8.6. They're both very attractive. They're both very symmetrical. If you average out these two values, the average rating for a symmetrical face is 8.7. If you rate a face on its symmetry, then that means that the average rating for a symmetrical face is 8.7. Now let's look at asymmetry. For this example I'm going to show you two pictures. The first picture is a symmetrical woman. The second picture is an asymmetrical woman. The asymmetrical woman has a rating of 4.1. The symmetrical woman has a rating of 9.8. If you average these two values, then you get an average rating of 7. You can see that a symmetrical face is rated higher than an asymmetrical face. The average rating of a symmetrical face is 8.7, and the average rating of an asymmetrical face is 7.0. A symmetrical face is rated about a point and a half higher than an asymmetrical face. This tells us that if you have a symmetrical face, then you're going to be more attractive than if you have an asymmetrical face. Now, what if we did the same study, but we looked at a different set of raters? What if we looked at a set of raters who were all black? If we did the same experiment, we would come up with a different average rating for a symmetrical face. In this case, the average rating for a symmetrical face is 7.9. The average rating for an asymmetrical face is 6.5. So now the average rating for a symmetrical face is about 1.5 points higher than the average rating for an asymmetrical face. Then what if we looked at a set of Asian raters? If we did the same study with a set of Asian raters, we would get a different average rating for a symmetrical face. In this case, the average rating for a symmetrical face is 8.4. The average rating for an asymmetrical face is 6.5. The average rating for a symmetrical face is about two points higher than the average rating for an asymmetrical face. Now, what if we looked at a set of raters who were all white, but who"
LLAMA,cmv-209,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is nasty. Why do Americans think they are so sanitary, but use dirty toilet paper to clean themselves? This is a very good question, and I don't think that it has been asked before on this forum. Toilet paper was first introduced in the USA in 1857. Before that time the method of cleaning one's bottom after defecation was probably quite varied. The USA has a huge toilet paper industry. But many other countries do not use it, or use it in conjunction with a bidet. In many countries with hot climates, people use the left hand to clean themselves. The question ""Why do Americans think they are so sanitary, but use dirty toilet paper to clean themselves?"" is an interesting one. I think the answer is because they don't know any better. This is because the majority of Americans have been brought up on toilet paper. So it is habit. If you have been brought up on toilet paper, then it is natural to think it is the best way of cleaning your bottom after defecation. I think that the reason why toilet paper is preferred to water in the USA is the same reason why water is preferred to toilet paper in other countries. It is a matter of what you have been brought up on, what you are used to. So the Americans use toilet paper because they have been brought up on it, and they think it is best. People in other countries, where they have not been brought up on toilet paper, and use a bidet, think that toilet paper is dirty and disgusting. Whether to use a bidet or not depends on what you have been brought up on. If you have been brought up on toilet paper, then you think it is the best way to clean yourself. If you have been brought up on a bidet, then you think that using toilet paper is disgusting. It is a matter of habit, upbringing, and what you have been accustomed to.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-209,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is an acquired taste."" ""All of these things are ridiculous you know what's great? Wipes! You can buy them at any drugstore!"" (In fact they're so easy-access in some places it feels like all there really needs doing here might be making sure people stocked up on TP.) Everything else seems superfluous; why would we want something special just because someone buys our product from Whole Foods or Trader Joe's rather than Target down by your office building?"""
Human,cmv-209,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option. Cleanliness In this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wipingbidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.) Secondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone. ""But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!"" No, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good. Comfort Good quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.) Price I understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money. Eco friendliness I think we're past the whole'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up. To clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical. Edit: The point here is that given a choice between a bidet and toilet paper, toilet paper is better. In situations where there's no other alternatives, of course one will be used over the other.

OpenAI,cmv-209,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is not as effective as a bidet in terms of personal hygiene. Bidets are designed to clean thoroughly and remove all bacteria, while toilet paper might not remove everything. Bidets are also more comfortable and hygienic because they don't cause irritation or leave bits of paper stuck to your skin. Many people who switch from toilet paper to bidets find that they feel much cleaner and fresher after going to the bathroom. It might take some getting used to, but using a bidet can be a great alternative to using just toilet paper."
BigScience,cmv-209,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the single most important thing in any person's bathroom. In addition to being able to hold your urine more easily (and thus not running away with it), it's also an excellent way of keeping yourself clean while you are waiting on the toilet without getting wet or dirty from having to wash down just about everything that's been sitting there. Also, if you're someone who doesn't like to get up multiple times per day at night to go pee as part of their regular schedule - which includes me! - then using a bidet can make urination more convenient because you don't need to stand up every time except maybe two or three times during the course of each evening before going out. You may be wondering where all these benefits come into play when we consider how much better public restroom facilities really are than they were five years ago?"
PaLM,cmv-209,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is barbaric. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Bidets are more hygienic. Toilet paper can leave behind bits of fecal matter, which can cause infections. Bidets, on the other hand, use a stream of water to clean the area, which is more effective at removing all traces of waste. 2. Bidets are more comfortable. Toilet paper can be rough and abrasive, which can irritate the skin. Bidets, on the other hand, use a gentle stream of water that is soothing and refreshing. 3. Bidets are more environmentally friendly. Toilet paper is a major source of waste, and it takes a lot of resources to produce. Bidets, on the other hand, use very little water and no paper. I know that using a bidet can be a bit of a learning curve for some people, but I encourage you to give it a try. You might be surprised at how much you like it! Here are some tips for using a bidet:  Start by sitting on the toilet as you normally would.  Place the bidet nozzle about 6 inches away from your body.  Turn on the bidet and adjust the water temperature and pressure to your liking.  Use the bidet to clean the area around your anus.  Pat yourself dry with a towel. If you have any questions about using a bidet, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm happy to help! Here are some additional benefits of using a bidet:  Bidets can help to reduce the incidence of hemorrhoids and other anal problems.  Bidets can help to improve your overall hygiene.  Bidets can help to make you feel more refreshed and clean after using the bathroom. If you're looking for a more hygienic, comfortable, and environmentally friendly way to clean yourself after using the bathroom, I encourage you to give a bidet a try."
PaLM,cmv-210,"Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for their policies. Alcohol is legal and widely available, and it is generally accepted that people can drink alcohol in their free time without it affecting their work performance. However, marijuana is still illegal in many places, and there is a stigma associated with it that makes employers more likely to view it as a problem. This is even though there is no evidence that marijuana use impairs work performance any more than alcohol use does. In fact, a study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that marijuana users were less likely to be involved in accidents or injuries at work than non-users. The study also found that marijuana users were more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and to have higher levels of job performance. Despite this evidence, many employers still have a negative view of marijuana use, and they may be more likely to discriminate against marijuana users than alcohol users. This is unfair, and it is a double standard that needs to be addressed. Employers should not be allowed to discriminate against employees based on their marijuana use, just as they cannot discriminate against employees based on their race, gender, or religion. Marijuana is a legal substance, and it should be treated the same as alcohol in the workplace. If employers are concerned about marijuana use affecting their employees' work performance, they should implement drug testing policies. However, these policies should be applied equally to all employees, regardless of whether they use marijuana or alcohol. The double standard between alcohol and marijuana in the workplace needs to be eliminated. Marijuana is a legal substance, and it should be treated the same as alcohol in the workplace. Employers should not be allowed to discriminate against employees based on their marijuana use."
BigScience,cmv-210,"Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for discriminating based on legal status (a matter of opinion). But maybe that's just me. The comment about ""legal"" is interesting in that sense: my understanding would be that it's not illegal for companies to ask employees questions like ""Do you drink?"" or ""Can you do without it?"" when they are actually hiring people - but then again, I can imagine if a company asked such a question (or any other question) during the interview process because someone said something negative behind their back at work, they'd find out later when an employee decided to quit. A: I had this conversation with my boss once. He basically told me he didn't care what kind of substance you used to use while you were working here. The reason being that the problem wasn't where you obtained your drugs, its how much. So long as you're using them occasionally then what's wrong? It doesn't bother him if i take 10 cigarettesday or 1 e-cig per month. And we discussed how problematic marijuana could be even considering a medical perspective. But I feel that everyone should understand that no amount of personal freedom will make up for dangerous substances doing more harm than good within one's body system. A: Likely this person has already been through the hiring processes. If heshe takes cocaine at job interviews before getting hired then why wouldn't heshe continue until retirement? I'm sure heshe took cocaine so hisher performance would drop significantly after they learned these facts which probably happened during testing andor evaluation What if heshe does drug tests regularly? Is she going to get fired from her current employer tomorrow for taking coke? I doubt very much whether any business says ""I want a job candidate who uses crack and heroin along with alcohol regularly...but I'm willing to overlook temporary 'abuse' because I've seen great performances over time...I'll keep you employed as long as you stop using the products."" It depends upon actions taken by HR rather than business practices alone. A: I think you've answered yourself- for the most part, yes. If you talk about marijuana openly, fine; nothing changes. If you go into details, though, well... different things become possible depending on national laws regarding recreational access and possession, etc., but I'd suspect that you'd also hear some pretty weird stories over time too."
LLAMA,cmv-210,"Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for a double standard. Yeah, employers can be pretty arbitrary when it comes to stuff like that. I'm just saying, it's not a double standard in the sense of alcohol being legal and weed being illegal, I think that's where the confusion is. It's not a double standard of ""weed is illegal and alcohol is legal, therefore it's ok to drink but not smoke up,"" I don't think that's what they're going for. These are the reasons I'm hesitant to legalize it."
Human,cmv-210,"Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis to drug test. In my view, if a person is doing good work (on drugs or not), then they should be kept working. If they're doing a bad job (as a result of doing drugs or not), they should be fired. It seems like pinning bad workplace behavior on what well could be, for example, responsible legal pot smoking is lazy and pointless. To this point: I could show up drunk to work in the morning. This wouldn't show up on a drug test, yet it could carry negative consequences for the company. I could be caught and fired for this. Same as if I showed up high. Note that none of these instances of being caught involve a drug test. What does drug testing white collar workers accomplish? We have consistently seen similar'zero-tolerance' policies fail spectacularly in schools and elsewhere. It is crazy to assume that workers will be responsible adults unless they prove otherwise? Also curious about your thoughts on jobs involving heavy machinery. Maybe those jobs shouldn't drug test either? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

OpenAI,cmv-210,"Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis I see what you mean now. Yes, there may be a double standard between alcohol and marijuana in the workplace, as employers may be more lenient towards alcohol consumption while completely prohibiting marijuana use. However, it's important to remember that employers have their reasons for instilling such policies, such as concerns over safety and loss of productivity. As with any company policy, employees should abide by the rules set forth by their employer while advocating for change if they feel the policy is unfair or biased."

Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you've ever taken any drugs, while others (such as the military) will have an investigator ask you in person, and even ask your friends if they've ever seen you use drugs. Is there a way around the ""Have you ever used drugs"" question on job applications?"
Tsinghua,cmv-211,"I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you have a criminal record, but most don't. So, unless you have been arrested and convicted of a crime, you can keep it secret. So, I'm going to say it now, don't worry about it. Not every person has a criminal record, and if they do, you can keep it a secret. 2. If you do have a criminal record, there are ways to hide it from employers. I know that this is hard to believe, but it's true. You can be arrested for something, and then cleared, and you can keep that arrest from showing up on your background check. You can do this by filling out the standard form, stating that you have never been arrested. The reason this works is because employers do background checks on job applicants. They are supposed to check the police records and see if you have been arrested, but they don't. There is a big loophole in the law, so employers don't check to see if you have been arrested. It's important to note that it is illegal for employers to lie on their background checks, so you have to tell the truth on the form. But, if you tell the truth, and state that you have never been arrested, it will be completely off your record. You can even state that you are under investigation, if you want to. This is completely legal, and if you have been arrested, and then cleared, you can keep it a secret. 3. The real reason you want to keep your criminal record secret is to protect yourself from future employers. In the criminal justice system, it is nearly impossible to get a job without a criminal record. If you have a criminal record, you have a serious disadvantage, because employers will have a harder time believing that you are trustworthy and honest. It's no wonder that many people end up getting jobs, despite having a criminal record. But, if you do have a criminal record, and you do not have the resources to hire an attorney, it is unlikely that you will be able to get a job. If you have a criminal record, and you want to keep it a secret, you need to hire a criminal defense attorney. This is an expensive process, but if you do it right, you can get a job without having a criminal record. Even if you don't want to hire a criminal defense attorney, you can still keep your criminal record a secret. You can hire a private investigator to do the background check for you. The private investigator will look into your background, but they won't tell the employer. So, if you hire a private investigator, you can still keep your criminal record a secret. In conclusion, if you have a criminal record, and you want to keep it a secret, there are a few ways to do it. You can hire a criminal defense attorney, or you can hire a private investigator. The private investigator will do the background check for you, but you can keep your criminal record a secret. I hope this article helps you understand the difference between criminal records and criminal records that are hidden. Criminal records that are hidden are not necessarily a good thing. It's possible to have a criminal record that is hidden, and still get a job, because employers will still do a background check. So, the criminal record that is hidden may not actually be hidden. You have to do your research, and see what the laws are in your state. The laws in your state will determine if you have a criminal record, and whether or not it is hidden."

Third, show that you have changed. Employers want to see that you are a responsible and trustworthy person who is unlikely to commit another crime. This means that you need to have a stable job, pay your bills on time, and stay out of trouble with the law.

Some people worry that these devices could pose a threat to privacy and security, as they are constantly listening to and recording conversations in the home. It is important for users to be aware of the data that Amazon Echo collects and how it is used. Amazon assures users that it only stores recordings of interactions with the device for a limited time, and that the data is encrypted and protected. However, some privacy advocates argue that the device could still be vulnerable to hacking or other types of unauthorized access. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to use Amazon Echo or similar devices, and to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks. It is also important for companies like Amazon to be transparent about how they collect and use data from these devices, and to take steps to protect the privacy and security of their users."

LLAMA,cmv-212,"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand the risks.] The Echo is a Bluetooth speaker powered by a Siri-like intelligent assistant called Alexa, which you address by saying ""Alexa,"" followed by a command. The Echo is listening at all times and learns over time. The Echo is always connected to the Internet, so Alexa can order a pizza for you, hail a car, or call someone. This creates a number of problems. First, it's hard to see the advantage over just using a smartphone. Second, it's even easier to see how you can have a conversation with an Echo device, then have that conversation broadcast to the Internet and stored in the cloud. Imagine how easy it would be for Amazon to use the conversations and data to generate personalized advertisements, which it would then push to your Echo device. This may not be a huge concern for most consumers. But for journalists, activists, and attorneys, it is a concern. If you are an investigative journalist, you probably do not want your sources knowing that you are asking Amazon's search engine for the phone number of a drug dealer. If you are an activist, you probably do not want Amazon knowing about your plans to protest a pipeline or to donate to a nonprofit. If you are an attorney, you probably do not want Amazon knowing you are consulting with a client about a legal strategy. This is the way the intelligence community has been operating for years, and it is still incredibly harmful. I agree with Mr. Greenwald here. That said, I have not seen a good survey about how many people already have Alexa-enabled devices in their homes. If you do, it would be helpful to know the number of people using these devices and what they are doing with them. But on the issue of Alexa listening and recording all the time, Mr. Greenwald does not go far enough. What about all the smartphones that listen and record all the time? The smart speakers from Google and Apple that listen and record all the time? Today's reality is that there is a good chance that someone is listening and recording all the time, and the person doing the listening and recording is not someone that you would necessarily trust. You are more likely to trust the person you have invited into your home, and more likely to trust a person who is not a stranger. This is why the Greenwalds of the world need to think more about the benefits of increased listening and recording, and less about the risks. The benefits are huge and are, in fact, potentially life-saving. All of this is not to say that there are no risks associated with these devices. There are risks. But these risks need to be compared to the benefits of these devices. The risks are likely lower than we think. For instance, we know that the people at the NSA are not paying attention to the vast majority of conversations that are taking place on the Internet, including those that are being recorded. They are too busy monitoring the activities of foreign governments. They are also too busy monitoring the activities of terrorists and foreign spies. They are not listening to the conversations of everyday people. For another example, take a look at the recent concerns raised about the NSA's collection of Americans' phone call records. The NSA had a program called Section 215 of the Patriot Act. This program allowed the NSA to collect records of Americans' phone calls, including who the callers were, when the calls took place, and how long they lasted. This was a controversial program. Many people were concerned that the NSA was using the program to listen in on Americans' phone calls. This was not the case. In 2015, the U.S. Congress debated whether to renew the Section 215 program, which expired on June 1, 2015. As part of the debate, Congress was given a classified report about the program. The report said that the NSA collected the records of 534,396,785 Americans' phone calls. It also said that only 300 of those phone calls were selected for further investigation. The NSA's massive collection of Americans' phone records was used only 300 times in 2015. Why did the NSA collect the records of 534,396,785 Americans' phone calls when it was only going to use those records 300 times? Why"
Tsinghua,cmv-212,"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why Amazon is so worried about Alexa.] If you use Alexa in your home, then you can control your lights, turn on your TV, turn off your thermostat, control your garage door opener, etc. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. You can also tell Alexa to play your music or check the news or read you a bedtime story. Amazon says that Alexa will be the hub for the entire home. Alexa is smart enough to not only be a voice-controlled remote control, but it's also smart enough to know when you're not in the house, and what's going on around you. Alexa can give you information about your car, your friends, your family, and even your cat. With Alexa, you'll never have to leave the couch again. [Read more about how Alexa will change your life.] And you can bet that people will start taking advantage of Alexa. We all know that Alexa can be a bit over-the-top sometimes, but she's still pretty entertaining. As long as you're okay with your Amazon Echo telling everyone that you're out of milk and you need to stop watching TV, then Alexa can be a great addition to your home. Alexa is still in its infancy, and there are some limitations to what she can do. She can't really read you a bedtime story yet, for example. But that's going to change in a few months. And the fact that you can only get Alexa in the US is an obvious barrier to adoption, but Amazon is working on international support, too. If Amazon Echo takes off, you'll be able to control your TV from your couch. (Amazon) Amazon is hoping that Alexa will take off because it's so useful. And it's not hard to see why. As long as you don't mind Amazon Echo taking over your life, then you can bet that she'll get even more useful over time. The question is: how many people will be okay with Alexa taking over their lives?"
Human,cmv-212,"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand what Amazon Echo is.] If you don't have the time, this is the pitch: Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free and always on. With seven microphones and beam-forming technology, Echo can hear you from across the room - even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound. Echo connects to Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more - instantly. All you have to do is ask. Essentially, it is an omnipresent Siri that lives in your home and is constantly listening. The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument. Reason 1: Laziness A lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level. Example: ""Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list."" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least. Example:'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events. Example: ""Alexa, what is the chance of rain?"" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report. Reason 2: Reliance on Technology Most of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, ""Become a part of the family!"" Example: ""The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning."" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together. Example: ""The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account."" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out. I think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion. Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy Major corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. Example:'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' ""I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me."" All I could think while watching this was, ""Genisys is Skynet!"" Here is a link to the [Amazon page.] So, can anyone give me some reason as to why Amazon Echo can be more helpful than harmful? Edit: View changed by ufssbmule1 with [this comment!] Great points.

BigScience,cmv-212,"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why - it's actually quite violent!] This is because Amazon's software will not only monitor your every move through its speakers and cameras but also transmit them all back to their servers in real-time. It seems like we can't get away from smart speakers any more as they are everywhere. We've covered a few good ones before such as the JBL Link 20 vs Sonos One Max. But today we're taking our time to go deeper into some smart speaker options that you should know about, so keep reading! If you're looking for an affordable voice-controlled speaker with excellent sound quality then consider getting this one out there. With three different sizes and five colors to choose from, these pods aren't just cool-looking devices; they have enough power to last up to 12 hours on a single charge depending upon how loudly you use the device. The pair come equipped with Alexa built-in which allows users to control almost anything using verbal commands. There are two models available here at 129 each- simply select whichever one looks better suited to match your style while keeping within budget limits. One key thing worth noting here is that HomePod mini doesn't support Android phones or tablets currently. This means iOS fanatics wouldn't be able to enjoy listening to music via Bluetooth anymore. Another interesting feature that's been added recently with respect to compatibility is the ability to play audio files from other sources after downloading podcasts directly onto the speaker itself. For instance, Spotify customers could stream content stored in the cloud directly from their Echo without having to leave the app opened anywhere else.

PaLM,cmv-212,"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why.] Amazon Echo is a hands-free speaker that responds to your voice. It can play music, answer questions, control your smart home, and more. It’s essentially a personal assistant that’s always listening. Echo is powered by Amazon’s Alexa voice service, which is also available on other devices like the Amazon Fire TV and the Amazon Echo Dot. Alexa is constantly being trained and updated, so it’s getting smarter all the time. Echo is a very convenient device, but it also has the potential to be very harmful. Here are a few reasons why:  Echo can be used to spy on you. Echo is always listening, and it can send everything you say to Amazon. Amazon says that it only uses this data to improve the Alexa service, but there’s no way to know for sure. If you’re concerned about your privacy, you shouldn’t use Echo.  Echo can be used to control your smart home. Echo can be used to control your smart home devices, like your lights, thermostat, and security system. This could be a security risk if someone else gains access to your Echo.  Echo can be used to spread misinformation. Echo can be used to access information from the internet, and it can read it back to you. This could be a problem if you’re not sure whether the information is accurate. Echo is a powerful device, and it’s important to be aware of the potential risks before you use it. If you’re concerned about these risks, you may want to consider using a different voice assistant, like Google Home or Siri. Here are some tips for using Echo safely:  Don’t use Echo in private conversations. If you’re talking about something sensitive, don’t use Echo. It’s always listening, and it could send everything you say to Amazon.  Set a strong password for your Amazon account. This will help to protect your data from unauthorized access.  Be aware of the privacy settings for your Echo. You can control what data Echo collects and how it’s used.  Use caution when using Echo to control your smart home. Make sure that you only give Echo access to the devices that you trust.  Be skeptical of the information that Echo provides. Echo can access information from the internet, but it’s not always accurate. Always check the source of the information before you rely on it. Echo is a powerful device, but it’s important to use it safely. By following these tips, you can help to protect your privacy and security."
PaLM,cmv-213,"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very conservative. I've noticed that people are more reserved and tend to keep to themselves. They also have a strong sense of community and are very family-oriented. I've been living in the United States for the past 5 years and I've noticed that the culture is much more open and relaxed. People are more outgoing and tend to be more expressive. They also have a stronger sense of individualism and are more independent. I've enjoyed living in both countries and I've learned a lot about different cultures. I think it's important to be open-minded and to appreciate the different ways that people live."

OpenAI,cmv-213,"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are influenced by Islamic customs, traditions and values. As a result, you may have grown up with certain cultural and religious norms. It's important to respect these norms when in Turkey and Dubai. In Turkey, the majority of people are Muslims, but the country is also secular, which means that there is a separation of religion and state. This means that while Islam is an important part of Turkish culture, the government does not enforce Islamic laws. However, it's still important to be respectful of the customs and traditions of the people you meet. In Dubai, Islam is the predominant religion, and the country is governed by Islamic law. This means that there are strict rules and regulations regarding dress code, public behavior, and social interactions. It's important to research and understand these rules before visiting Dubai to avoid any misunderstandings or cultural faux pas. Overall, it's important to be open-minded and willing to learn about the cultural and religious norms of the places you visit. By being respectful and observant of local customs, you can create a positive and memorable travel experience."
BigScience,cmv-213,"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very similar to each other. I have a friend who is returning from Malaysia where you can legally drink alcohol (if it fits your religion). I think it's also legal here with some kind of restrictions but mostly they will be non-alcohol drinks. (The main difference between my country countries which restrict drinking is that we don't owndrive cars.) Therefore if you're an adult, then yes, there should be no problems at all. A: Some parts of Europe allow Muslims to consume beer or wine. For example Israel allows Muslim women to wear full face veils including henna tattoos. However many people do object to this practice. In Canada for example, Islamists tend to want more and more rights while religious conservatives try hard to keep theirs. So there may be issues especially because of their close relationship with states like Saudi Arabia where most muslims live."
LLAMA,cmv-213,"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are still conservative. By nature, I'm a shy guy, also to be honest, I'm not a muscular or super handsome man, so I didn't have much opportunity to date women. I have been in a few relationships, but they all didn't last long. One day, I get a match on Tinder and she's a white, beautiful woman from Florida. She's a professional and a smart woman. Also she's 18 years older than me. We started talking and her language was a bit coarse but I thought that's how Americans are, so we talked a lot. One thing led to another and we ended up on a date in Istanbul, where she was visiting for business. I was living in the capital city at the time and I went to visit her. I didn't get her to my hotel room, I took her to a nice hotel, she was not happy but at that time, I didn't know she was looking for a place to have sex. So we spent a day in Istanbul and I flew back. We still kept in touch and eventually, we ended up meeting at her home. She's in a marriage, but it's not a happy one. So, she was looking for a way out. We had a nice day and we had sex. I left after a few days. She sent me a long text message saying she's falling in love with me and wanted to be with me. We started talking about getting married, she told me that her current husband is not a good man and they are not even sleeping in the same bed. She told me she had a good life, good job and can support me financially. She even told me that she's going to tell her husband that she's in love with me and we're getting married. I believed her. I went to her city and we spent a few days together. We had a nice time and I left. We kept talking, but she kept delaying the time when we're going to tell her husband. At one point, she started asking for money. I thought it's to help her get out of the current marriage so I sent her a few hundred bucks. Then, she told me she had to go to a business trip to Abu Dhabi. I asked if I can go with her and she said I have to pay for myself, which I did. We had a nice time in Abu Dhabi, she went for her meetings and I went shopping. At the end of the trip, she asked me if I can give her some money to take back to her husband, which I did. I went back to my country and we kept talking. At one point, she started talking about how she's thinking about her retirement and she's thinking about buying a house in my country, which I thought was a nice idea. We had a phone call where she told me that the house she's looking at is 300k and she asked if I could help her with a loan, which I said I would. At the end of the conversation, she said she's going to send me a picture of her house. She did, and I'm not sure what it was, but I think it's the picture of a church. She didn't mention anything else. I called my bank and I started the process of getting a loan. I was expecting her to get the loan on her own, but she didn't mention anything about it. So, I was going to pay the money for her. I was in the process of getting the loan when she came to my country again. I told her that I'm getting the loan, she said that's good. We had a nice time for a few days. She went to see her family, I stayed in the hotel. At the end of the trip, she told me that she's going to her mom's house and asked if I could send her some money for groceries, which I did. A day later, she said she didn't have much money to get back to her country, so I sent her some more money. She went back to her country and we kept talking. At one point, she said she's going to come to my country again, but I have to pay for her ticket. I did. When she got to my country, she said that she's going to stay at the hotel, I said no problem. She stayed in the hotel and we had a nice time. After a few days"

Human,cmv-213,"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body. To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off"
PaLM,cmv-214,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones (he/she/they) are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered is xe/xem/xyr. This set of pronouns is often used by non-binary people who do not identify as either male or female. However, I believe that the use of these pronouns is unnecessary and can actually be harmful. First, the use of these pronouns can make it difficult for people to understand what you are saying. This is because xe/xem/xyr are not commonly used pronouns, and many people are not familiar with them. This can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. Second, the use of these pronouns can reinforce the idea that there are only two genders. This is because xe/xem/xyr are often used by people who do not identify as either male or female. This can send the message that there are only two options when it comes to gender identity, which is simply not true. Finally, the use of these pronouns can be harmful to people who do not identify as either male or female. This is because xe/xem/xyr can be seen as a way of othering these people. It can make them feel like they are not part of the mainstream, and that their gender identity is not valid. For all of these reasons, I believe that the use of pronouns past the three most common ones is not necessary and is actively harmful. I encourage people to use the pronouns he/she/they when they are unsure of someone's gender identity. This will help to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. In addition to the arguments I have already made, there are a few other reasons why I believe that the use of pronouns past the three most common ones is unnecessary and harmful. First, the use of these pronouns can lead to discrimination. People who use these pronouns may be harassed or bullied, and they may even be denied jobs or housing. This is because these pronouns are often seen as being strange or unusual. Second, the use of these pronouns can make it difficult for people to communicate. When someone uses a pronoun that is not familiar to the listener, it can be difficult to understand what they are saying. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. Third, the use of these pronouns can be divisive. When people use pronouns that are different from the traditional ones, it can create a sense of division between people. This can make it difficult for people to work together and to build relationships. For all of these reasons, I believe that the use of pronouns past the three most common ones is unnecessary and harmful. I encourage people to use the pronouns he/she/they when they are unsure of someone's gender identity. This will help to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone."

Tsinghua,cmv-214,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in many areas of life are the following: It is important to note that I'm not against new pronouns or against the inclusion of the different genders. I just think that the usage of new pronouns in daily life is harmful. Providing people with a new pronoun to use does not help them feel more comfortable. On the contrary, it just creates confusion. The thing is that people have to find their own pronouns to identify with, and there is no need for a system of artificial pronouns. I've come across a new, simple system for pronouns that I think could be useful in this context. It's the following: Use the pronoun 'he' for a male. Use the pronoun 'she' for a female. Use the pronoun 'they' for anyone who does not identify as a male, female or neither. This is a very simple system and it's very flexible. It can be used to refer to any gender that does not identify as a male, female or neither. The system is very easy to understand, and the word 'they' has the same meaning as the word 'it'. It can also be used to refer to an animal, a human, a non-human animal, an object, an inanimate thing, a thing that exists but is not alive or a thing that does not exist. I hope that the introduction of this new pronoun system can help people find their own pronouns to identify with. As I said, I'm not against the inclusion of different genders, I just think that a new pronoun system for everyone is not needed. There is no need to create a new pronoun for every gender, because people are not animals, they are human beings."
BigScience,cmv-214,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in English up to and including Romance languages (possibly a few more) would be: - The plural form, omitting the article: ""Hey!,"" ""look at those butterflies!"" ""I like this song!"" or ""you didn't eat your breakfast?."" The only reason I consider them worth mentioning here is because they constitute a minority group if you were only allowed to use one pronoun per sentence without an object complementizer. There are probably other reasons such as grammar rules and etymology but that's another discussion altogether. A: We have already seen why subject-verb agreement doesn't work with people who move around freely. In addition we know grammatical gender works differently when there is no reference point - but then again, many things do. I think it's high time people started using one singular first person pronoun, even though it isn't used very often by native speakers. Also remembering ""The [singular] is mine"" wouldn't hurt. A: Although you did mention ""a minority group"" specifically, I'd also qualify my answer with ""the biggest problem I've ever had."" Here goes: There's been much debate about whether or not these forms shouldcan be considered correct English; after all we don't really need any additional terms like 'proper' or 'correct' since both phrases refer to what language theory calls 'gender neutrality'. In short - yes they're wrong unless you're speaking from an established culture which has previously accepted the same constructions as being natural and valid. Also please note I'm not building anything on top of 'The Big Five' theories so I won't name them explicitly. Possessive pronouns vs copula possessive nouns: We say ""my music player"";'my brother's car' it sounds clearer and less awkward than saying 'the music player' or 'a car belonging to my brother'; although admittedly you could argue that the latter two examples still sound better than 'My music player belongs to me' - literally meaning 'I own the music player' rather than 'I play the music player'. Subjectverb versus verbsubject: You might say'my sister read her book' and others will reply ""I'm reading my book now"" while everyone else knows exactly what's going on; however, nobody says ""My sister reads my book."" This kind of ambiguity creates confusion amongst foreign learners when learning how English sentences function. Verbs prepositions: Putting verbs where preposition phrases belong (e.g., writing clauses instead of adverbs, placing adjectives before nouns etc.) seems perfectly fine to me, yet we're told we shouldn't use them. On balance I suppose this falls into the genderswap category but who am I kidding? Some of us prefer simple present tense syntax (no articles needed) whereas others feel it's incorrect because he can't speak in the third person like someone who's never heard of John Doe III. As long as he's awareable to distinguish between 3rd 1st or 2nd persons of speech we'd be far happier."
LLAMA,cmv-214,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered on social media is ey, eir, em, eirs, eirself. I believe that they do not convey any extra information and are potentially more difficult to understand than the pronouns they seek to replace. The argument for these new pronouns is that English is currently not gender neutral and that the current pronouns are not inclusive enough. For example, it is often said that a sentence like ""every student should study hard"" is problematic because it does not include non-binary students. This is a misconception because the subject does not need to be singular. The sentence ""all students should study hard"" is grammatically correct and does not require a new pronoun. Another argument is that it is always better to avoid the singular ""they,"" especially in formal writing. I personally have never encountered a situation in which I could not use the singular ""they"" in formal writing. The singular ""they"" has been used in English for centuries. The argument that a new pronoun is necessary to avoid confusion is a non-sequitur. If someone is confused by a sentence like ""everyone should be kind"" then this is because they are unfamiliar with the singular ""they."" They can learn to understand this construction. If they already understand ""they,"" then they will understand ""ey."" The main argument against these new pronouns is that they make sentences harder to understand. The common pronouns have a strong association with their meaning. The more rare a pronoun is, the weaker this association. The meaning of a word is not the same as the concept it is supposed to represent. For example, ""Dog"" is a word but it is not the same as a dog. A word can represent multiple concepts. For example, the English word ""man"" can be used to refer to a specific man, men in general or a set of people including both men and women. This is very confusing for a non-native speaker, but it is not something that we as native speakers have to consider. We learn the meaning of a word by hearing it in context. A word like ""ey"" does not have a strong association with a certain meaning. It is difficult to guess the meaning of this word and therefore it is not clear what it is referring to. This means that the extra information that is supposed to be conveyed by the new pronoun is lost. A word like ""ey"" has no meaning in itself. Its meaning is completely contextual. The word can be understood in context but outside of context it is meaningless. A similar example is ""the."" In a sentence, the word ""the"" is easy to understand. It refers to an object that has already been mentioned. However, it is hard to guess what ""the"" refers to without knowing the context. The same argument applies to the singular ""they."" It is easy to understand in context, but the meaning is unclear outside of context. ""Ey"" and the singular ""they"" are both difficult to understand, but I think that the singular ""they"" is easier to understand because the singular ""they"" is a natural part of the English language and has a strong association with its meaning. This is why the singular ""they"" has been used for centuries and why it is recommended in style guides for formal writing. If a new pronoun is used, then the singular ""they"" is easier to understand than a non-standard pronoun. If the singular ""they"" is considered too confusing, then the other person can be referred to by name. This is more cumbersome than a pronoun, but it is easier to understand than an unfamiliar pronoun. In short, these new pronouns are not necessary and make sentences more difficult to understand. Does a Word like ""Ey"" Make Sentences More Difficult to Understand? It is easy to prove that a new pronoun is unnecessary. The case for this proposition is much easier to make than the case against it. An example for a new pronoun that can be encountered on social media is ey, eir, em, eirs, eirself. I believe that these new pronouns do not convey any extra information and are potentially more difficult to understand than the pronouns they seek to replace. The argument for these new pronouns is that English is currently not gender neutral and that the current pronouns are not inclusive enough. For example, it is often said that a sentence like ""every student should study hard"" is problematic because it does not include non-binary students. This is a misconception because the subject does not need to be singular. The sentence ""all students should study hard"" is grammatically correct"
Human,cmv-214,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xexerxerself"" or ""ziziszimself."" My argument is as follows: 1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities. 2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns. 3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in news media, but rarely used outside: Pronoun (pronounced ""shin-youji or simply TAIJUANREN "" new gender person) literally means New Gender Person [sic]. As a proper noun it's read as shinjinshinren "" . It could also mean neue Geschlechtsperson - nengeschuchtrige Personlichkeit Neutschauchruliche. This Japanese coinage was coined by Yasuoka Etsushi to describe transgender people who were born with one sex chromosome set different from their body organs; this includes intersexed femalesmales too if they identify themselves female male etc.. The term has been adopted into English where possible due its simplicity compared other recent terms such 'non binary', non gendered persons.

I don't like how they say ""well my brain is more feminine,"" like excuse me that's something that women I understand how you feel. It can be frustrating when people attribute certain behaviors or traits solely to one gender or the other. It's important to remember that, despite what some people may believe, there is no one way to be a certain gender. Gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that reflects a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors. It's perfectly valid for someone to identify as having a brain that is more feminine or masculine, but it's also important for us to realize that these concepts are culturally constructed and not necessarily tied to biological sex. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to determine how they want to express their gender identity and to treat others with respect and kindness regardless of their gender expression."

Suddenly they're ""offended"" by Germany not giving anything back for all it has given them over hundreds if years (not just economic help). I don't get why this is suddenly such an issue now when there was never any real complaint until recently... Maybe because many people were getting government handouts before being forced into early retirement or losing jobs due European Union regulations that made every company move production overseas where labor costs cheaper than Europe can provide though taxes on exports etc.? Sure sounds like something which would offend me too but ok maybe my understanding doesn't match up with reality here...maybe you guys know what really happened since your superior intellect will probably tell us how we should feel instead so no need trying anymore..even apologies mean nothing!

It's not fair for Germany to impose such harsh measures on Greece when it's not their fault that Greece is in debt. But I also understand why Germany is doing this. They don't want to see Greece default on its debt, because that would have a negative impact on the entire EU. So they're trying to force Greece to make some tough decisions in order to get its finances in order. It's a difficult situation, and there's no easy solution.

To answer your question, I think that Greeks were the first people who realized that the euro was a bad idea and that is why they did not want to give up the drachma. If you remember the referendum on the adoption of the euro, the ""no"" vote won by a majority. However, the Greek government ignored the ""no"" vote and accepted the euro anyway. by Alexis "" 14 Apr 2010, 13:56 Yes, the question of the euro is being raised by some people in Greece. So far, I have not heard anything of substance in the way of an argument about the value of the Euro. I think that it would be politically impossible to disengage from the Euro without leaving the EU. I don't think that the Greeks have the stomach for that. The European Union, and the Euro, are much bigger than Greece. If Greece were to disengage from the Euro, it would be the biggest mistake in its recent history. Greece's European neighbors, and the rest of the world, would see it as a rejection of modernity and a step backwards. The Greek economy is not strong enough to endure the shock of re-issuing the drachma, and the country would be seen as a banana republic.

If you mean by a ""step backwards"" that Greece will have to work hard to rebuild its economy from the ground up, then yes it will be a step backwards. However, I don't see any other way to fix the Greek economy. The present path that Greece is on is a slow death. A return to the drachma and a massive devaluation is the only way to make the Greek economy competitive. by Alexis "" 15 May 2010, 11:46 It looks like the drachma question has been decided for us: the EU has made it clear that Greece must remain in the Eurozone.

What is the logic in this? It doesn't make sense.. I thought the germans were in favour of a strong euro, they were the ones who were pushing for the ECB to do the printing to prevent the collapse of the euro. I thought it was a good idea for a strong currency, but that is not the case. The greeks are not the only ones who are suffering.. So many european countries are in the same boat. It's not a matter of whether the ECB printed too much money, it's the question of what you do with it. How much do you print and where do you put it? Do you use it to bail out your own banks? Then you can be sure they'll just print more money to bail themselves out again, which is not good for the rest of the world. Do you print it to bail out your debtors? Then it is just wasted money, because your debtors will still go bankrupt. So how do you use the money? To buy your own currency? Then it is just more money to print, more money for the banks to make even more money, and more money to buy your own currency, so the banks have more money to print even more money. It is all a cycle, a circle. There is no real solution. It's just a matter of how long it will take before the next recession comes, and the banks will have to take a hit. 2) What is the logic in the Greeks going out of their way to boycott German goods?

So, why are you still arguing? I don't think it's right to sue for spilling coffee on yourself when you are driving and it was your fault that you spilled it on yourself. I don't think it's right to sue for spilling coffee on yourself when you are driving and it was your fault that you spilled it on yourself.

BigScience,cmv-217,"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. It just seems to me that each time out there is a food poisoning incident involving otherwise healthy children who eat at McDonalds one hears how disgusting the place really is and that these people were sickened by this gross negligence on the part of the fast-food giant. I am going into my 5th year of medical school next week which means I'm about nowhere near being ready to be an actual doctor yet so please don't take offense if I seem like someone who's rather ignorant in some areas currently but hey that's life... The fact remains that when you are dealing with something as sensitive as human health (not to mention your ability to pay bills) you want whatever choices possible for treatment options available to you. You as parents would have wanted services offered even though they didn't necessarily come from a hospital setting - take advantage of them whenever possible!!!! Give those little ones their chance to heal! Didn't we all learn something from ""The Lion King""? And yes, thankfully his kids survived but did he ever get what he deserved? Speaking of animals.... I think it's important that everyone remember the recent events surrounding the attack on George Zimmerman. He has already been found not guilty after being convicted of 2nd degree murder. It's true that in most cases where there are questions regarding allegations brought against innocent victims and defendants alike things go pretty quickly towards convicting the accused... however sometimes they do find ways around such systems and decide during trials to put off doing justice until later.."
OpenAI,cmv-217,"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit is a complex case, and the facts of the case have been widely debated. From one point of view, it can be argued that it was the fault of McDonald's because they served coffee that was far too hot, resulting in severe burns to Mrs. Liebeck. McDonald's had been warned many times before about the excessive temperature of their coffee, and many other fast-food restaurants serve coffee at a much lower temperature. Moreover, Mrs. Liebeck initially requested only around 20,000 to cover her medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering. On the other hand, it can also be argued that Mrs. Liebeck bears some responsibility for the accident. She was the one who spilled the coffee on herself, and she may have been careless in handling the cup. However, even if she was partially responsible, McDonald's was still found to be 80 responsible for her injuries according to the jury verdict. Ultimately, the case serves as a reminder to businesses that they have a duty to keep their customers safe, and that they can be held accountable if they fail to do so. Additionally, it highlights the importance of personal responsibility and caution when handling potentially hazardous materials."

Human,cmv-217,"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The facts are: McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants) McDonalds has NOT lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee."" Change my view, please. [sources] EDIT: Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys."
PaLM,cmv-218,"A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not remove this duty. The leader of the opposition is still a member of parliament and should still be working hard to represent the interests of the people who elected them. They should be holding the government to account and making sure that the government is acting in the best interests of the country. They should also be presenting alternative policies and ideas, and trying to convince the public that their party is the best choice to lead the country. Even if the opposition leader does not agree with the policies of the government, they should still be respectful of the democratic process and the fact that the government was elected by the people. They should not resort to personal attacks or insults, and they should always be willing to listen to the other side of the argument. The leader of the opposition has a difficult job, but it is an important one. They are the voice of the people who did not vote for the government, and they are the only ones who can hold the government to account. They should never forget that their duty is to serve their country, not just their party."
OpenAI,cmv-218,"A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not mean the end of their obligation to serve their country or their constituents. As a leader of a political party, they should continue to work towards the betterment of their country by offering constructive criticism of the government's policies, proposing alternative solutions, and keeping the government accountable for its actions. They can also work to mobilize their base by building grassroots movements or advocating for specific issues that align with their party's platform. Additionally, they may focus on strengthening their party's position for future elections by recruiting new members and developing strategies to appeal to a broader range of voters. Ultimately, a political party leader's duty to their country transcends the outcome of any one election."
BigScience,cmv-218,"A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does NOT mean the person loses all of hisher duties. I don't think this is right. It seems like it only covers those who win, but in my opinion, if you lose elections, your job ends and doesn't start again until you're elected some other time. It's not just the president either; losing for any office means the office holder can no longer do anything with that position except resign from office (and therefore end up unemployed). The issue here isn't whether it's constitutional - that's moot now given Trump actually tried to fill an unexpired term as part of Lyndon Johnson's ""legal limbo"" scheme while under house arrest following Watergate Scandal. The real question is: was I involved? If so, I'm sure I'll be one of many victims of Donald Trump's impeachment trial and conviction after he gets out tomorrow...and then what? This sounds good on paper - I've found myself nodding along at times during past debates considering how Trump should behave as President - but the reality will probably turn much darker than we expect: Yes, Trump might get away with using fake news stories against Hillary Clinton, lying about Russian collusion, sequestering federal funds without Congressional approval, blocking campaign contributions by foreign governments, etc., etc., because the American voters see him playing these games every day. But there are limits when dealing with politics people whose livelihoods depend upon their repute as legitimate politicians that could use such tactics to further themselves politically... In fact, the basic definition of cheating comes down to what happens once someone finds out another player cheated - which usually includes them doing something bad back toward the cheater. Given many Americans already trust little else in Washington, where would even begin to prove cheating through credible researched evidence? Sounds very reasonable to me, Tom! While our testator presumably did not want to deal with legal liability later today, she certainly wanted her children to know that they aren't supposed to take advantage of others' generosity. Trump certainly violated many things written into law, although his actions were likely covered by plausible deniability laws regarding communications, etc. (All based around fear mongering) But beyond Trump being able to run roughshod over rules, ethics and regulations, let's consider this: What exactly is the difference between having red carpet access and breaking the law?"
LLAMA,cmv-218,"A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not negate that duty. That is a given. If the leader of a political party, especially one that had held power for a long time, loses an election, they have two choices: stay and fight another day, or leave. If they stay, they have a duty to their party to make a considered decision about their leadership of the party. And if they leave, they have a duty to their party and their country to give their successor the best chance to govern, or to fight another election if they haven't won a majority. Jose Socrates resigned as the leader of the Socialist Party in Portugal, after winning only 28 of the vote. He had led Portugal into the Eurozone. Angela Merkel will be staying on as leader of the CDU in Germany, after winning only 33 of the vote. She has led Germany through the Eurozone crisis. Margaret Thatcher won only 42 of the vote in 1983, after leading Britain through the Falklands War. She stayed on as leader of the Conservative Party, and won a second term. Hillary Clinton stayed on as US Secretary of State, after her presidential aspirations were dashed in 2008. Paul Keating did not leave Parliament after losing the 1996 election, despite urgings by his supporters. He stayed on, and won the seat of Blaxland in 1997, and retired in 2004. Jose Socrates has clearly done the honourable thing. Angela Merkel has clearly done the honourable thing. Margaret Thatcher did not do the honourable thing. She was intent on winning the next election, and did win it. But her political career was destroyed afterwards by the Poll Tax debacle. Hillary Clinton has done the honourable thing. She has served her country well and will continue to do so. Keating has done the honourable thing. He has served his country well and will continue to do so. Kevin Rudd has not done the honourable thing. He has failed to do the honourable thing twice. Firstly, by fighting an election which he had no chance of winning, and secondly, by not going quietly into the night. I know that Kevin Rudd can't be expected to sacrifice himself for his party. That is his choice. But he did choose to run for the leadership, and he should honour his duty to the country, and to the Australian Labor Party, to stay and serve his country and his party, until they, and the people, have had a chance to see the Gillard government fail, or win. I am confident that he will stay on, and I am confident that he will serve his party and his country with the same distinction that he did when he was Prime Minister. I am confident that the Australian Labor Party can win the next election, and I am confident that Kevin Rudd will help them do that. After all, the Australian Labor Party is the only party with a mandate to govern."
Tsinghua,cmv-218,"A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government).

This failure is not the party leader's fault but that of the party.

Losing an election does not prevent a good leader from leading, it merely humbles them, but losing an election will cause a bad leader to give up.

If they had won the election I presume that they would not have retired. which makes it very evident that the leaders of the losing parties did not have leadership skills andor a good vision but merely wanted to win for the sake of power. edit: This has already been eye-opening, there are details which I did not know before coming to light and for that reason I feel compelled to pronounce multiple delta's just for the nuance points which have changed my understanding although not necessarily my wider view; I'm not even sure if that's allowed.

Human,cmv-219,"Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint and Ubuntu). 1. Gaming. Games such as ARMA 3 or any other DirectX 11 games cannot be played on Linux at all. In fact, Steam refuses to download them. Even some directx 9 games cannot be played using Wine. (personal issues were splinter cell, battlefield (any of them), and SWBF2 to name a few.) 2. Ease of use. Whenever I try to look up how to do something on Linux it always involves the terminal and confusing commands. With Windows, everything has a easy to use interface. Compared to Windows, Linux is not as polished and requires a lot of setup to easily use. Many technologically challenged people have no idea how to use the terminal, especially without Google's help. 3. Drivers. I applaud Linux for its ability to easily recognize system drivers (chipset, USB stuff, etc) but when it comes to things such as joysticks and gaming controllers, even Nvidia drivers and other special drivers (ps3 eye webcam), the terminal has to be used with varying degrees of success. 4. Applications. Almost every program is Windows only and has no alternative in Linux. Some examples are anything GPUgaming related, (MSI afterburner, geforce experience, etc.) fan control, temp monitors, and any program that has an exe at the end. In short, the excessive use of the terminal combined with the lack of common programsdrivers make Linux unusable for both the everyday consumer and the gamer. I am completely willing to change my view, as I have tried Linux many times with the same common issues appearing. I just see no benefit Linux has over Windows, besides being free.

PaLM,cmv-219,"Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint, Ubuntu, and PopOS). Some examples include:  Printer drivers: Printer drivers are often not available for Linux, and even if they are, they may not work properly. This can make it difficult to print from a Linux computer.  Games: Many games are not available for Linux, and even if they are, they may not run well. This can make it difficult to play games on a Linux computer.  Software: Some software that is available for Windows is not available for Linux, and even if it is, it may not work properly. This can make it difficult to use certain software on a Linux computer. Additionally, Linux can be more difficult to use than Windows. For example, the user interface is different, and there are different keyboard shortcuts. This can make it difficult for Windows users to switch to Linux. However, Linux is also a powerful operating system. It is free, open source, and secure. It is also very customizable, so users can make it work the way they want. Linux is also a good choice for developers, as it is often used for development work. Overall, Linux is a good operating system, but it is not as easy to use as Windows. It is best suited for users who are comfortable with technology and who are willing to learn a new operating system. Here are some tips for Windows users who are thinking about switching to Linux:  Start with a beginner-friendly distribution. There are many different Linux distributions available, and some are more user-friendly than others. For Windows users who are new to Linux, I recommend starting with a beginner-friendly distribution such as Mint, Ubuntu, or PopOS.  Use a dual-boot setup. This will allow you to try out Linux without having to give up your Windows installation. If you decide that you don't like Linux, you can simply delete the Linux partition and continue using Windows.  Install Linux on a spare computer. This is a good way to try out Linux without having to worry about messing up your main computer. You can also use a spare computer to learn how to use Linux.  Join a Linux community. There are many Linux communities online where you can get help and support. This can be a great way to learn about Linux and to meet other Linux users. Switching to Linux can be a daunting task, but it can also be a rewarding one. Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. If you are willing to put in the time to learn it, Linux can be a great alternative to Windows."

For starters, Linux is an open-source platform, meaning that the source code is accessible to everyone, which provides greater flexibility and customization options. Likewise, Linux is significantly more secure than Windows, mainly due to the way files and configurations are managed on the system. Besides, Linux offers a vast range of libraries, tools, and software that can be installed for free, making it an excellent platform for developers and system administrators.

Hi, I am getting difficulties with my two year old leopard gecko and I was hoping you could give me some guidance. I do not have a single or the other, but my parents do, and so does my sister (their dogs reside outside, mine lives indoors) and they all have various breeds. I am nevertheless a student, and I am sad to hear that there are so many ill-treated animals on the planet. I am a large advocate of undertaking anything to get animals out of shelters and into properties. Sick dogs will be vaccinated and the foster families are usually accountable for this, but the rescue will take care of the bill. To locate out far more about how to adopt a dog in Austin, Texas and learn more about Austin Pets Alive! Some rescue groups are breed distinct, but there are also ones that do not care what breed you have. I have an axolotl that I have had for about 11 years, but I have observed it is beginning to breathe a lot far more difficult and seems to be attempting to crawl out of the water, I don't know if it is sick or just older. Even if you never want to get a pet, make sure to support your nearby shelter by donating or volunteering."

This is not just a matter of animal welfare, it has also been linked with health concerns by public relations specialists. The media have big responsibility for creating an environment where human rights violations regarding animals can be talked about in society and reported on but that does not mean they should try to get people offended or upset. There's no reason why 'pet bashing' couldn't actually help if you were trying to raise awareness around issues like domestic violence against women - so long as you're careful not to go too far!

Eating habits that have been learnt or not corrected, even right down to ""fussy eaters"" then gets passed on through generations and is the route cause for a massive percentage of the population.

I don't know if it is just because they are a good source of protein and they are delicious, but it is what it is. And that is my own personal opinion.

OpenAI,cmv-220,"In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals Yes, that's correct. The UK has strict laws and regulations when it comes to animal welfare, including the welfare of pets. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 was introduced to protect the welfare of all animals, including pets, and sets out the responsibilities of pet owners to ensure their pets are cared for properly. If pet owners fail to provide adequate care for their pets, they can be prosecuted and even banned from keeping pets in the future. This is because pets are reliant on their owners for food, shelter, and medical care, and it is the responsibility of the owner to provide these things in order to ensure the pet's welfare."
PaLM,cmv-221,"This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movie]. I've seen a lot of people arguing about whether or not it's ""okay"" to change the race of a character who has been traditionally white. On the one hand, I can understand why people would be upset about this. When a character is changed from one race to another, it can feel like the original character is being erased. It can also feel like the new character is being used as a token, or that they're only there to appeal to a certain demographic. On the other hand, I think it's important to remember that race is not a fixed thing. It's a social construct that changes over time. In the past, it was considered ""normal"" for white people to play characters of all races. But today, we're starting to see more diversity in casting. This is a good thing, because it reflects the fact that the world is a diverse place. I think it's important to look at each case individually and decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not it's ""okay"" to change the race of a character. There are no hard and fast rules about this. But I think it's important to consider the following factors:  The original intent of the character. Was the character created to be a specific race? Or was race not a significant factor in their creation?  The impact of the change. How will the change affect the story? Will it make the story more inclusive, or will it alienate fans of the original character?  The representation of minorities. Is the change being made in order to increase representation of minorities in media? Or is it simply a token gesture? Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to change the race of a character is a complex one. There are no easy answers. But I think it's important to have a conversation about this issue, and to listen to the perspectives of all involved. Here are some additional thoughts on the topic:  Race is not a binary. There are many different races and ethnicities, and people can fall into more than one category. It's important to be aware of this when we're talking about race and representation.  Race is not always visible. In some cases, a character's race may not be explicitly stated in the text. This can make it difficult to determine whether or not a character should be played by an actor of a different race.  Race is not the only factor to consider. When we're casting a character, we need to consider more than just race. We also need to consider the actor's skills, experience, and availability. I hope this helps to shed some light on the issue of race and representation in media. It's a complex issue, but it's one that we need to talk about in order to create a more inclusive world."
Human,cmv-221,"This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot] , and the casting of [Emma Stone as Allison Ng in Aloha] . Now, I know both of these examples aren't perfect opposites, but the reception has been wildly different. When Michael B. Jordan was cast as the new Human Torch, people were thrilled. Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics] , people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting ""culturally insensitive,"" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her ""unlikely heritage,"" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 14 Chinese heritage. I don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther] comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor ""insensitive?"" I'd love to hear other thoughts. I've only seen these two issues (minority casting of white roles and white casting of minority roles) tackled separately. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot] and about the [racially motivated casting of the upcoming Exodus: Gods and Kings] . Lately, I've been coming up with ideas for a script. I don't have a plot, yet. I don't have much more than a few key characters, but I'm still working on that. One of the things I've been trying to avoid is the ""casting"" of the characters. I'm not trying to avoid the race of the character, I'm avoiding trying to think of the actor who will play that character. The reason I'm doing this is because I don't want my perception of the character to be influenced by an actor. If I picture a character as being played by a certain actor, I think I'd tend to write the character to fit the actor rather than vice versa. There's also the issue of the race of the character. I don't want the race of the character to be influenced by the casting of the actor. If I imagine a certain actor playing a part, I might picture the character as being the same race as that actor. If I write the character to fit the actor, I'd probably picture the actor as the character. In the end, if I get far enough with the script to make it worthwhile, I want the casting to be as neutral as possible. I don't want the race of the character to be decided based on who's available to play that part. One thing that I've found that I've been doing is picturing actors from the past. For example, I'm trying to picture a character as if he were played by Humphrey Bogart. I'm sure that there are other ways to do this, but for me, it seems to work."

BigScience,cmv-221,"This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in Batman 21] and Lee Bermejo's The Dark Knight Returns. It's always worth remembering the history of these characters to better understand what they mean now. Dick Grayson became Nightwing when he was a teenager after his father killed himself from an overdose on sleeping pills. But there were some questions left unanswered as to why the boy took over instead of Bruce Wayne or Jason Todd who had both died years ago. As it turns out, Dick Grayson found out all along how much his parents loved him but just didn't know enough words to tell them so decided to hide everything. It seems pretty clear at least according to Martin, that Jason Todd will come back one day (as soon as Tom King gives us permission), but there's no explanation yet given by DC Comics as to which character takes over as Robin next time. A: The answer depends very greatly upon your definition of ""next"" Robin has three different versions: (1) TASROR: This version appears in Tim Burton's Adam West-Burt Ward film ""Batman Returns"" ""The Dark Victory."" It features the dark-haired 'Young' Batman named Thomas McGuire. He can be considered part 1 of 3, followed later by Ryan Potter, then Peter David. (2) ROBIN AGE-OLD: He appears in Grant Morrison Frank Quitely's ""Robin Unchained"" graphic novel series. This version looks like Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins movie's Batman. (3) BATMAN THE NEW YORKER COLLECTION: In issue 2 of Batman 1, we see Alfred fighting against criminals wearing orange jumpsuit-like clothes to play bat-gymnastics. To me, that makes it more likely than not because I don't think it's possible for any of Batman's regular suits to fit someone younger. So maybe that's where you'll find the third Robin.... (4) BLOOD IN THE OCEAN: Alison Brie stars in the Netflix movie based off the original HBO mini-series Next Wave. She plays Bethany Youngblood aka Blood in the Ocean.

Not that I disagree with you on the child part, but why the double standard? ""Two consenting adults having sex is ok, but one consenting adult having sex with a child is not ok.""

And yes, I think that it is more than a bit disturbing that one of the two people is an adult, rather than a child. Why? The only reason I can think of is because the adult is the more dominant party in the relationship, and therefore would not be likely to react in a submissive way. I don't know if I buy that. Perhaps you could explain why you think that the adult should be more dominant in the relationship? I've seen a few clips of the video and I have to agree with you on the content.

The problem is when it is presented as something it's not. When people go to an adult site they expect to see adults, not children. I think the laws are there to protect people from seeing things they don't want to see and the children from being exploited. I think the children are being exploited when they are not involved in the decision making process. If an adult is in a video where they are having sex, it's their choice to be there. I've seen pornography where I've seen a child being penetrated. That's not a choice. That's being penetrated by an adult. That's where the line is crossed. I think there's a difference between the viewers and the people making the porn. I don't think it's fair to blame the people watching for not knowing. Many of them don't know they are watching kids because they are not told. If the people making the porn are told they are using children, then they are committing a crime. If they are not told, then they are not. When people watch porn, they don't care about the actors. They just want to masturbate.

So, what do you think? What would you do if you lived in a world where it was impossible to do anything? I think it's important to remember that no matter what situation we're in, we always have the choice to make the best of it. We can choose to find meaning in our suffering. We can choose to hold onto hope. We can choose to never give up. And I believe that, no matter what, God is always with us. He is always there for us. He is always working for our good. So, even in the darkest of times, we can always find hope in God."
Tsinghua,cmv-223,"Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything good. The punishments are so severe that no one would even think about trying. What would be the reason for doing good? Why do good? I think there are two answers to this question. One, you are acting for a reason, but there is no other reason. The other is that you don't do it because of the reasons. Why do you do good? I think it is because of what is in our hearts, our hearts being the source of our motivations. But what are those hearts? Why do we have hearts? And how did we get them? I think we are told these things, but I don't know. We have certain characteristics that God has placed in us. We are also made in the image of God. I believe that these characteristics are love and compassion, but I'm not sure about that. I'm also not sure about the image of God, but I think that is also a given. So I think we are told to do good because God wants us to do good, and I think we have a desire to do good because we have those characteristics. I don't know what you are trying to do. It seems like you are trying to get people to do good because it is what God wants them to do, and then you are arguing that it is what God wants because He is good, but that is the whole problem. What is God good at? And how does that make Him good? And what is God doing with that good? And how does that make Him good? I think God is good because He is the source of all good. He is the one who is the source of all goodness. That is why He is good. But I think you are trying to make Him good by using that good to accomplish something. That is what you are trying to do.

Human,cmv-223,"Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Then in that world there would be no reason to praise or reward someone for doing the moral thing because there is no other option. Likewise, there is no one who could possibly be punished (like sending them to hell for instance). Clearly we do not live in such a world, but religious individualsgroups who insist that something should be illegal or made nearly impossible due to religious views are trying to make our world more like the one in the scenario I suggested above where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Thus, forcing people to comply with the rules of your religion actually seem to make the rules less meaningful which seems like something that religious individuals would want to avoid. Note, I'm only talking about things where the main reason for believing them is religion - like beliefs about gay marriage, premarital sex, drinking alcohol, etc. Therefore, things like the belief that you should not murder people would not count as having a primarily religious nature because most people also find murder horrific in a separate sense from religion. To phrase it differently, if all alcohol disappeared from earth tomorrow and humans somehow could no longer make it, would abstaining from drinking alcohol mean anything? I don't think so. Without having the choice to do the'wrong' thing, then doing the'right' thing is meaningless. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything wrong and there will be consequences if your actions go against what God has planned for them; would that make me feel safer or more insecure? I mean yes people can choose their own path through this life but at times like these wouldn't we all wish someone else were on our side fighting by us instead of being held back with fear over nothing because ""God knows better""? Personally looking out into an uncertain future gives my skin chills That was just one example (and probably most confusing). Why does faith seem worth everything when no matter how much good things are around himher they still have doubts about something even though he said himself: ""Your sins shall find thee OUT!......................."" why must humanity think every action needs confirmation from another human before taking part? After watching countless documentaries such as Religulous, The Da Vinci Code etc., skepticism seems very healthy among intelligent individuals who seek knowledge which might shed light upon certain mysteries found within history pertaining only those involved. When talking specifically concerning Christianity many accounts involving various Acts done throughout time appear questionable without knowing whether Jesus Christ actually existed since historical artifacts don't always prove his existence beyond reasonable doubt either way while evidence exists supporting same! What makes religion translate itself onto society today anyways let alone influence small children rightfully playing outside yet unknowingly imbibing its teachings inside themselves later leading down paths never intended nor wanted due ignorance rather than understanding..So again..if everyone gets along perfectly well then doesn'T evolution take place anyway?? Shouldn ' t true believers trust fully blindly trusting matters related solely based off ancient manuscripts lacking precise details?? Is pure logic effective enough?. Or maybe too dangerous given irrationality present especially amongst otherwise highly educated Humans inhabiting similar circumstances seeking comfort currently existing nowhere except perhaps once living somewhere eons ago...yet perceiving needlessly harsh judgments everywhere now pointing fingers profusely filling minds fuller faster until truth remains buried beneath falsehoods burdening already tortured souls......so yeah having Faith -is- easy!!!

BigScience,cmv-223,"Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything evil. Then if there's an intelligent being who has created us and also his creations (which includes himself) why would he create such a thing? Shouldn't this just be the largest self-contradiction ever? Sorry for any misunderstanding or loss of context. A: The most obvious reasons are that creationism makes sense only as part of a picture which requires supernatural explanations otherwise it's nonsense. You claim he's got no empirical evidence with respect to life's origins on earth but there isn't really much debate about past Earth conditions on other planets; we have pretty good idea how things went on Venus, Mars and probably even Pluto back when they were all-encompassing sun - don't forget that Jupiter was once like our own Sun before it became gas giant. Even without considering those possibilities another reason to think life may exist elsewhere in the universe is that evolution itself precludes its possibility within the bounds of acceptable science: what does it mean to evolve from something else? Evolutionary theory tells us nothing can change by natural means; all changes must result from either mutation (s), drift, selection andor gene flow. The latter two processes require knowledge of distant cousins - i.e., ancient life forms could have been able to cross over into Earth's history long ago. Furthermore, human beings define ourselves largely through culture which in turn depends upon shared experience. No one knows what happened prior to the recorded existence of humans though religion says ""that's far too early;"" therefore people cannot reasonably expect a causative agent beyond their ken. So our best bet at explaining life is still God."

Tsinghua,cmv-224,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... Gamergate started out as a protest movement against the harassment and abuse of women by a small group of sexist men. It became a mob to attack anyone who opposed them. The police used the excuse of a possible rape to raid the Gamergate headquarters, violating their own code of conduct. Gamergaters then harassed, stalked and slandered a girl they thought had been raped. Gamergaters demanded a reinvestigation of a rape case, when it was their own actions that led to the police investigation. They also tried to smear a girl who was falsely accused of sexual assault. The harassment and intimidation of women was a good thing. The harassment and intimidation of anyone who did not agree with them was a bad thing.

LLAMA,cmv-224,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... I agree with the notion that there is a double standard in the media regarding how the left and the right are treated. I agree that there is a cultural bias against the right (though I'd argue that the right has as much of a bias against the left, and both sides are wrong to do so). I also agree that the actions of the police officers in Baltimore were inexcusable and that the victims should be awarded damages. I disagree with the rationale. I disagree that the officers' actions are inexcusable because they are police officers and police officers are held to a higher standard. I disagree that their actions are inexcusable because they are police officers and police officers are held to a higher standard. I disagree that their actions are inexcusable because they are police officers and police officers are held to a higher standard. I disagree that their actions are inexcusable because they are police officers and police officers are held to a higher standard. Police officers are people too. When they do things that people shouldn't do, they should be held accountable for those actions. They are not held to a higher standard. They are held to the same standard. People are held to the same standard. I am very firmly against the notion that people are treated differently based on the color of their skin, and I think that if we really want to be a colorblind society, then we need to treat everyone the same. If we are going to judge police officers by a different standard than we judge everyone else, then we are not being colorblind. We are being racist. I am not a police officer. I am a white person. I am a man. I have never been arrested. I have never been in a fight. I have never had my life threatened. I have never been in a situation where my life was in danger. But I can imagine what that must feel like. I can imagine that if I was ever in such a situation, I might act out of fear, and my actions might be wrong. I can imagine that my actions could result in harm to someone else. I can imagine that I might be wrong. And I can imagine that I might be held accountable for those actions. And I can imagine that I might be held to a different standard than others because of who I am. But I hope I'm never in that situation. And I hope that if I am, I'm never held to a different standard. And I hope that if I am held to a different standard, I'm held to a higher one. I hope that I'm held to the same standard that we hold police officers to. joshgrobanstyles 23 points24 points25 points 4 years ago (6 children) I think the higher standard comes from the fact that they're granted a degree of authority by the state. That's what sets them apart from an everyday citizen. It's not the fact that they're police officers that makes them different; it's the fact that they're granted special powers by the state. You're free to disagree with that standard, but that's why I think it exists. MagicalMushroom 11 points12 points13 points 4 years ago (0 children) Their higher standard comes from their higher authority, not the fact that they are police officers. davey101 5 points6 points7 points 4 years ago (1 child) In the UK the police are generally expected to act in a more reasonable way than the general public. This is because they are granted powers above and beyond the normal person. For example, if I am physically threatened, I can use ""reasonable force"" to defend myself. If a police officer is threatened, he can use ""reasonable force"" to defend himself. The difference is that, if the officer is threatened, he can use firearms, pepper spray, batons, restraints etc etc, and these are all ""reasonable"" for an officer to use. In the UK the police are granted powers above and beyond the normal person. This is because they are granted powers above and beyond the normal person. But it's not the powers they are granted that makes them different. SaiyanBaby 0 points1 point2 points 4 years ago (1 child) But their higher authority is the fact that they're police officers.

Human,cmv-224,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... we've gone way overboard with this PCSocial Justice mentality. Recent examples are- -the furor this morning (at least on twitter) over Amy Schumer in the WaPo. -Hannibal Burress had a minor run-in with several notable female twitter personalities including Gaby Dunn. (there's a whole list of responses, if it doesn't show up just go through his timeline) -Jerry Seinfeld made news when he said he wouldn't play college campuses anymore, to much reminding of his relationship with a 17-year old twenty years ago, and snickering over how his material isn't even edgy anyway. -Chris Rock said the same thing last year. I guess he's a shitlord too. -Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin. -Not to pick on Gaby Dunn, but earlier this year she blew up at Josh Groban, because I guess young male celebrities being horndogs is completely new and has never, ever happened in human history. Hell, even amongst the more notable far-left twitter there's infighting. Suey Park and Lauren Chief Elk are going at it over DMs to an exstolen laptops And depending on who you believe, Rania Khalek is anti-black or ""baddominacana"" is racist against Arabs I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers. That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz? I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna. Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 247365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline? EDIT: I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter. I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons. One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there. It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden. Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedyentertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool. If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me. But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment. Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much. There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples. Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for.... reasons. Not sure. They're problematic somehow. EDIT 2: Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here. I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind. Other examples I could've used were Donglegate and ScientistShirtgate . I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance. Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism. Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case. I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy. If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it. I never claimed to be a social scientist. Or even just social. Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.

LLAMA,cmv-225,"Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting down opinions you don't agree with. I'm not an expert in politics or economics, but I think the idea of implementing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a terrible idea. 1. We don't have an answer to the question, what do you do when people have a guaranteed income? It's easy to say they can work as hard as they want and not worry about money. It's easy to say they can pursue their passions. But the real question is, will they? Will they try as hard? Will they work as hard? Will they do anything? The idea of being able to work hard and receive more money than you would with the UBI is the main reason that people are against the idea of a guaranteed income. If you can just work and receive a small amount of money, then what's the point of working hard and receiving more money? To the people who think that the UBI will allow people to work less, you are ignoring the effect of automation in our workforce. To the people who think that the UBI will allow people to work more, you are ignoring the effect of automation in our workforce. The idea of a guaranteed income is meant to replace the welfare system. Welfare is a system where you can only receive a certain amount of money if you are below a certain amount of income. This is meant to encourage people to work and find jobs to increase their income. If the welfare system goes away, will the UBI have this effect? 2. It's not affordable The cost of implementing a universal basic income is extremely expensive. According to CNBC, in the US, it will cost 3.9 trillion dollars to implement a UBI with a 10,000year basic income. To put that in perspective, the total amount of personal income in the United States in 2018 was 17.5 trillion dollars. That means that we would have to take roughly 22 of the total income in the US to give everyone a basic income. The idea of a basic income is to give everyone a fixed amount of money. This means that some people who have more money than others will get a very small UBI. For example, Bill Gates would only get a very small percentage of his overall wealth. The top 1 of earners in the US earn 20 of the overall income. The top 20 of earners earn 50 of the overall income. The bottom 20 of earners earn only 3 of the overall income. If a UBI is implemented, it will take a much higher proportion of income from the lower income earners, while giving a much smaller proportion to the higher income earners. The problem is that a UBI is only funded by taxes. The people who make the money will be the ones paying the taxes to fund the UBI. This means that the people who earn more money will be paying a much higher proportion of their income. What is the point of working hard to make more money if you are going to be taxed a higher proportion of that money? What is the point of earning more money if you can only spend it on the things you already have? 3. It would cause hyperinflation According to Business Insider, 1000 today would only be worth 209.28 in 20 years. Let's say we have a UBI of 1000month. That would be 12,000year. In 20 years, that would be worth 24,945.60. This is only an inflation rate of 2. If we implement a UBI of 10,000month, we are giving every person in the US 120,000year. In 20 years, that would be worth 288,971.20. That's a lot of money to be giving every person in the US. 4. It would cause deflation Since a UBI would give every person in the US a fixed amount of money, the idea is that it would help the economy by giving more people money to spend. The problem is that we have a fixed amount of goods and services to spend our money on. When we give more people more money, that doesn't mean that we can produce more goods and services.

Human,cmv-225,"Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes. I will try to explain my opinion. WARNING: looong rant ahead. I first watched Breaking Bad. I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just.... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrestedkilled. He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay. Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe? And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series. It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered ""grey"" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. THIS is considered good TV.

You might want more input on how much work its going take before knowing whether these challenges will lead toward success OR failure...

LLAMA,cmv-226,"Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and assume he wins and can get half the things he wants to do done. It's going to be a long process. The government is slow and getting the stuff he wants done is going to take a lot of time. A lot of the things he wants to do are things that the government has to do and not something that's going to be done overnight. A lot of it is also going to have to be done with Congress. I'm not saying that you should be pessimistic about Bernie Sanders. I'm not saying that you shouldn't want a Bernie Sanders presidency. I'm saying that you shouldn't assume he's going to be able to do everything he says he's going to do. I'm saying that you shouldn't get your hopes up because it's going to be a long process. So what do I suggest? I suggest that we continue to go out and protest and keep the pressure on. I suggest that we keep the pressure on and keep making sure that the things that need to get done will get done. We shouldn't let up and think that Bernie Sanders or any other President is going to do everything that needs to be done. I also think that we should push for more changes in local government. We need to push for more progressive candidates in local and state elections and we should push for the kinds of changes that are possible at the local level. We should be pushing for more progressive city councils, school boards, and state legislatures. We should push for progressive reform at the local level. We should also push for reforms at the state level like ballot initiatives, constitutional amendments, and state laws. We should be pushing for the kinds of reforms that are possible at the local and state level. So I say that we should keep the pressure on. We should keep protesting and we should keep pushing for reforms at the local and state level. We should not let up and we should not assume that the job is done once Bernie Sanders gets elected.

Tsinghua,cmv-226,"Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and just say that there's a chance he might actually be a good president, if not just by chance of being elected. Let's also assume that he actually can bring about a revolution in American politics and make the Democrats actually start fighting for the working class again. That's not impossible, I've heard Democrats actually admit this is a possibility. That still doesn't mean he'll do anything more than he already has done, which is to say that the most successful politician of the last half century is going to be an even more liberal politician than the most successful politician of the last half century. If he really can make the Democrats ""for the working class"" again, he'll still be at least as liberal as FDR, who's already the most liberal president in the history of the country. So if we want a Democratic president who's actually going to try to help working class people, we're going to have to be a lot more liberal than Democrats were in the 1930s. And that means giving up some of the most cherished social programs of the Democratic Party. We're going to have to give up the welfare state, Medicare, Social Security, and many of the environmental protections and labor regulations. We're going to have to give up affirmative action, the end of discrimination against gays and lesbians, and a number of other liberal policies. And it's not like this is an option for Democrats, either. I don't think the Republican Party is going to become more liberal. There's no evidence that Republicans will abandon their philosophy of ""less government"" or ""smaller government"" and instead embrace a philosophy of ""more government"" or ""big government."" The only option left is for Democrats to become more liberal. The only problem is that this isn't a realistic option. The last time we had a Democratic president who was really on the left, the Democrats lost the White House and lost control of Congress. The Democrats were the most liberal party in the country, and they still lost."

PaLM,cmv-226,"Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and look at the facts. First, the President is not a king. He can't just snap his fingers and make things happen. He has to work with Congress, which is controlled by Republicans. And even if the Democrats were in control of Congress, there are still a lot of things that the President can't do without their approval. Second, Bernie Sanders is a progressive. He's not a moderate. And that means that he's going to have a hard time getting anything done in a country that is still pretty conservative. Even if he could get Congress to agree with him on something, there's a good chance that the Supreme Court would strike it down. Third, Bernie Sanders is not a miracle worker. He's not going to be able to fix all of the problems in this country overnight. It's going to take time and effort. And even if he does make some progress, it's not going to be enough to satisfy his supporters. So, what can we expect from a Bernie Sanders presidency? We can expect some progress on some of the issues that he cares about, but we shouldn't expect a revolution. It's going to be a long, hard road, but it's a road that we need to travel."

Ending student debt through refinancing all current loans into something more flexible like bonds - not actual cash. (4) 15 minimum wage within 5 years among other things such rent control which has been shown time after again by Harvard economists have proven harmful once implemented on their own apart from massive increases taxes accompanying them or simply used incorrectly when combined instead.) What about ending wars? It almost makes you wonder why he doesn' t run under an election law where candidates must state policy before they can be nominated... The fact remains though; without support behind him especially if we get another Republican administration following Donald Trump there will likely only ever exist half measures unless Americans become radicalized themselves toward peace activismnonviolence etc.. If people start voting based solely upon how well someone represents nonviolent thoughts rather than those who scream most loudly then perhaps results might actually change positively over night! No doubt many do already vote using these criteria sadly however much resistance still exists against true civil disobedience backed up my armed forces fighting back rationally too bad so sad.

BigScience,cmv-227,"As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not the answer. What I am saying all along, as predicted by Daniel Pink and others in this space, is that we need more than just awareness raising campaigns or education programs to change behavior; there needs to be incentives for people who choose an alternative lifestyle because they see it has benefits for their health and happiness and therefore are willing to change. I think you are making the wrong comparison. It wasn't about whether everyone should eat organic every day (though it would probably make life easier). They were looking at what could be done with the money available from government spending cuts - so yes the focus was obviously on the environment but also on employment opportunities etc A great example is the UK where many companies now outsource work to India in order to save jobs here. The most recent report shows that around 4 million British workers will soon be leaving if these outsourced jobs move overseas, which may mean millions less taxpayers paying into our National Insurance payments system... ...which means fewer contributions to state pension schemes (and maybe even no State Pension) ....with your employer's contribution dropping too! It seems like such obvious advice. Yet it's one that's going unheeded over time. As I've written before, I'm sure I'll spend my entire retirement single-handedly on medical bills rather than trying to limit them. This article puts some numbers together: People do get sick sometimes. And, according to the Centers for Disease Control statistics, 1 in 8 adults suffer from chronic illness. But the reality is that only 35 of Americans take advantage of insurance coverage offered through employers or other organizations to cover costs related to long-term care. That leaves nearly two-thirds of us relying solely upon Medicare or Medicaid, either of which can cost upwards of 200 per month - especially when coupled with co-pays and deductibles. (See ""How much does long-term care really cost? And although these types of services help ease suffering, often times they're insufficient to provide comfort. Plus, using traditional methods doesn't always guarantee access to necessary treatments right away. Luckily, scientists and researchers are developing innovative new ways to address chronic disease management issues and promote wellness. This includes inventing tools that allow patients without easy access to doctors to connect directly with experts via video chat. In addition, computer technology makes it possible to deliver real-world physical exercises to users, even while behind closed doors."
PaLM,cmv-227,"As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a difficult decision. There are many factors to consider, including the child’s quality of life, the financial burden on the family, and the potential benefits of treatment. In some cases, it may be clear that treatment is not in the child’s best interest. For example, if the child is in a great deal of pain and there is no hope for recovery, it may be best to forgo treatment and allow the child to pass away peacefully. In other cases, the decision may be more difficult. For example, if the child is only mildly ill and there is a chance that treatment could improve their quality of life, it may be worth considering treatment even if it is expensive. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to pursue treatment is a personal one. There is no right or wrong answer. However, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment carefully before making a decision. Here are some of the factors to consider when making this decision:  The child’s quality of life. How much will the child suffer if they do not receive treatment? How much will they benefit from treatment? If the child’s quality of life is likely to be poor, even with treatment, it may be best to forgo treatment.  The financial burden on the family. How much will treatment cost? Will the family be able to afford the cost of treatment? If the cost of treatment is prohibitive, it may be necessary to consider other options, such as hospice care.  The potential benefits of treatment. What are the chances that treatment will be successful? How much will treatment improve the child’s quality of life? If the chances of success are low, it may be best to forgo treatment. It is important to remember that there is no right or wrong answer. The decision of whether or not to pursue treatment is a personal one. However, by carefully considering all of the factors involved, you can make the best decision for your child.

OpenAI,cmv-227,"As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is often not efficient use of resources. However, every life is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect. Therefore, it is important to seek balance between preserving life and being efficient with resources. In these difficult situations, it is important to have guidelines for resource allocation that are based on the principles of fairness, transparency, and compassion. These guidelines could weigh factors such as the severity of the child's condition, the potential for recovery, the financial impact on the family, and the impact on other patients who may be waiting for care. Ultimately, the decision about how to allocate resources in these situations requires careful consideration by healthcare providers, patients, and their families. It is important to have open communication and collaboration to ensure that the decision is made in the best interest of the child and society as a whole."
Human,cmv-227,"As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath. Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic. Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture.

Tsinghua,cmv-227,"As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is wasteful. The goal should be to provide treatment that results in the best possible outcome for the child. We should also ask if a child can recover from a life-long disability. When it comes to special education, we are faced with the same problem. Do we continue to provide education to children with disabilities when the evidence indicates they will never become literate or even able to learn the most basic of skills? How do we balance the child's rights to education with the rights of parents and taxpayers? In short, we need to ask the same questions that we should be asking about medical care. We have to look at the research. We have to consider what the outcomes are. Is the child likely to recover? Is the child likely to have a positive outcome? We should have the same standards for special education. Special education should be the last resort. It should be the best available option. It should be based on the best evidence. It should be based on a full evaluation. And it should be based on what is likely to be the best outcome for the child. I would like to conclude by mentioning one other point. This year's report also focuses on educational opportunities for disabled children in our state. The law requires all children with disabilities to have equal access to special education. However, I have been concerned that too many children are still being denied equal access. I am not aware of any case where a child has been denied equal access because of his or her disability. There are many reasons why a child is not in special education. But too many children are not in special education. Some children are not receiving special education because of the language barrier. Others are not receiving special education because of the stigma associated with special education. There are many reasons why a child is not in special education. In some cases the child's parents are opposed to special education. In some cases the child is not eligible for special education. But too many children are not in special education. I hope that the department will continue to monitor this issue and that they will keep me and the Legislature informed. This year's report also focuses on early intervention. The Legislature has asked the department to evaluate early intervention in the state. The department has not yet completed that evaluation. However, we do know that many children with disabilities are not receiving early intervention. Many children are not receiving early intervention because the parents do not want to provide early intervention.

LLAMA,cmv-227,"As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not a wise use of money. The cost of an experimental drug is the cost of the raw materials and the manufacturing cost. The company has to pay the employees that develop the drug. Pharmaceutical companies are not charities. They are businesses that must make a profit. You might want to consider the cost of lawsuits, insurance etc. Someone has to pay the bills. If we want to let the government pay for the drug, we have to raise taxes. This is why the NHS is in so much trouble. Notice, the NHS also has to pay for the RD of the drug. It is not just a matter of buying the finished product. The child's name is Charlie Gard. He has mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. MDDS is a progressive neurological condition that is ultimately fatal. Charlie Gard was born in August 2016. He was a healthy baby but by October 2016 he was not able to hold his head up or move his arms and legs. He had a breathing tube inserted and has been in intensive care since. His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, have been fighting to take him to the United States for an experimental treatment that has been used on mice and is undergoing further animal testing. The hospital asked the court for permission to stop providing life support. In April the court ruled against the parents. They are appealing the court's decision. The parents have raised over 1 million to pay for the experimental treatment. They were hoping that the court would allow the treatment to be tried. The parents are saying that they want to be able to make the decision to try the treatment. The doctors are saying that they don't want to prolong Charlie's suffering. A child born in the United States has the same chance of getting MDDS as winning the Powerball jackpot 3 times in a row. Most infants with MDDS do not survive past the age of 12 months. This is not a rare disease. There are only about 200 cases of MDDS in the world. That means that the odds of getting the disease are about the same as winning the Powerball lottery. I had a patient that had mitochondrial disease. He was a 25 year old man that was in a persistent vegetative state. He was deaf and blind. He was fed by a tube that ran through his nose into his stomach. He was on a ventilator. He was incontinent. He never moved. He never spoke. His muscles were tight. I had to cut his toenails. He was a healthy baby. He developed normally until he was 12 months old. He had a seizure. He didn't recover. He was born 19 months before the FDA approved valproate. Valproate is a seizure medication that is approved for use in babies. If he had been born 19 months later, he would have had the same chance of a normal life that you have. His parents never complained. They went to the hospital every day and read to their son and talked to him. I don't know how much the medication cost to keep him alive. His parents had excellent insurance and it probably didn't cost them anything. There is no test to predict who will get MDDS. There is no treatment for MDDS. There is no cure for MDDS. The experimental treatment has been used on mice. There is no evidence that it will work on humans. It might work. It might not. The treatment would have to be given to Charlie in the United States. He would have to be taken off the ventilator and transported to the United States. A charity in the United States is offering to pay for the treatment. They are not offering to pay for the transportation costs. A decision has been made. It is not in the best interest of Charlie to continue life support. The money that was raised should be used to support research into MDDS. 1 Response to Should Charlie Gard be allowed experimental treatment? Charlie Gard would be dead if the hospital did not provide life support. Charlie Gard would be dead if the parents did not provide care. A court decided that it would not be in the best interest of the child to provide the experimental treatment. The court made the correct decision. Anyone that thinks that the child"
PaLM,cmv-228,"To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. There are a lot of arguments for and against the death penalty. On the one hand, it can be argued that the death penalty is a just punishment for certain crimes, such as murder. It can also be argued that the death penalty deters crime. On the other hand, it can be argued that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment, and that it is applied in a discriminatory manner. One of the strongest arguments for the death penalty is that it is a just punishment for certain crimes. Murder is a heinous crime that destroys the lives of the victim and their family. The death penalty can provide a sense of justice for the victim and their family. It can also deter other criminals from committing similar crimes. There is some evidence to suggest that the death penalty deters crime. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that states with the death penalty have lower murder rates than states without the death penalty. However, other studies have found no statistically significant relationship between the death penalty and crime rates. One of the strongest arguments against the death penalty is that it is cruel and unusual punishment. The death penalty is the only punishment that is irreversible. If an innocent person is executed, there is no way to bring them back. The death penalty is also a very painful way to die. There is also evidence to suggest that the death penalty is applied in a discriminatory manner. Studies have found that defendants who are poor, minorities, or mentally ill are more likely to be sentenced to death than defendants who are white, wealthy, or have mental health problems. The death penalty is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides. There is no easy answer to the question of whether or not the death penalty should be abolished. However, it is important to consider all of the arguments before making a decision."
Human,cmv-228,"To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of ""developedfirst-world."" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most EuropeansAmericans would respond to this by saying ""I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?"" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goodsmoney down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legalpractical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

And I know I don't necessarily have the credentials to have an opinion. I'm not an economist, I'm not a banker, I'm not a CEO, I'm not an investment broker. I'm not a government employee or politician. I'm just a regular person trying to understand what is happening to our economy. After watching ""Inside Job"" last night I'm even more confused. It's all just too complicated for me to understand. So I just looked it up in the scriptures. Here is what I found: In the Book of Mormon there is a story about a prophet named Alma who teaches the people to be self-sufficient and industrious. They learn to plant, build, and care for themselves. Then a group of wicked men come to take over the land and Alma and his people escape to a new land. They are able to maintain their way of life and continue to prosper. In the meantime, the wicked men are in charge. And they are not good at maintaining their new land. 4 And they did not walk any more after the performances and ordinances of the law of Moses; but they did walk after the commandments which they had received from their king, which led them to do all manner of iniquity. 5 And they did walk after their own desires, having no law. 6 And this they did for the space of three hundred and twenty years; and they did walk after the commandments of their king. 7 And in the days of the first king were priests, and false priests; and they were led away by their own desires; and they were brought to believe in things which were not right. 8 And there was one among them whose name was Giddianhi; and he was their leader, and the governor of their secret society; and it was he that did murder the chief judge, and the judge's wife; and his name was Cezoram. 9 And it was he that did stab the prophet of the church, and did slay many of the people; and did burn many houses, and commit much murder, (and) as he did rise up in great flames of fire, and his throat was filled, even to overflowing, with flames, and his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his words were as a flame of fire, and his sword was the flame of a burning fire. 10 And the inhabitants of the land did cry unto the Lord against the house of Giddianhi, and did humble themselves before the Lord; and the Lord did hear their cries, and did send down his word unto them, and did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies. 11 And the battle of the Lord did stand in the land, even unto the destruction of the wicked. Then they were taken over by another group of wicked men called Lamanites. These men were not very sophisticated and just wanted to take the people's stuff. They didn't want to run the government, they just wanted to take and take and take. Lamanites were just evil brutes. And it seemed that the Nephites would be able to fight them off easily. But the Nephites were proud and wicked and it wasn't long before the Lamanites had taken over the whole land. In the New Testament, Christ tells the story of the ten virgins. They were waiting for the bridegroom to come, five were wise and brought oil for their lamps, five were foolish and did not bring oil. When the bridegroom came the foolish asked the wise for oil, but they did not give it to them. They told them to go buy some from the merchants. While they were gone, the bridegroom came and the wise went in to the wedding and the door was shut. When the foolish came back, they knocked on the door but no one answered. They were not prepared and were not able to go in to the wedding feast. I think we can draw some important lessons from these stories. 1. We are responsible for our own well-being. We need to prepare for the future and be self-sufficient. We need to be wise. 2. We cannot always trust our leaders. We need to make sure we understand what they are doing, and we need to be sure that they are doing things in our best interest. 3. We cannot always trust our government. We need to make sure we understand what they are"

It's important to approach complex issues with an open mind and a willingness to listen to different perspectives.

BigScience,cmv-229,"I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by paying more for the item. Most consumers are aware that they're buying an inferior product or service, but this doesn't take away from their desire and need to buy them The one exception would be if you were selling some kind of illegal good - like drugs - where price alone may not be enough. Such products have always been illegal in Canada because there's simply no point in making them free unless you're also giving up control over what people do with your goods (i.e., how many sell). If it's legalized then there will likely be demand for both stolen and sold items; thus both types of sales transactions could probably occur at about the same time given the nature of their use cases - i.e., buying drugs via theft versus stealing drugs. Fixed amount: This means everything happens on a pre-determined basis without any variation, which excludes working days only or weekends only. System-adjustable: Allows usersusers groups andor companies to set different fixed rates under which all activities happen Often times a project management team is tasked with creating schedules using these models - some very simple ones, while others might require much more complex calculations depending on scheduling rules, work dependencies etc. For example, let's say we want to manage daily deliveries made within an organization's sales territory. As per our requirements, delivery teams should arrive at 8am sharp every morning and depart between 7pm-6pm daily. Sounds pretty straightforward right? Well that's exactly why things become tricky when trying to create a schedule model based solely on fixed rate day-only delivery tasks! We'll further illustrate above examples using Trello boards created specifically for each scenario (in a future blog post). With projects being so important across businesses today, tackling traffic jams during peak hours has become a major priority for most transportation providers. They've introduced several initiatives and systems designed to provide better end-to-end solutions - including partnerships with ride-hailing services and freelance drivers -to fight congestion caused by commuters' travel behavior. In order to drive efficiency among its thousands of vehicles, Stride needs automated scheduling systems to organize random trips into scheduled routes. At present, workers manually input data address details, departure location, arrival destination, pickupdrop-off times, duration of trip, fare charges, driver's name photo ID number etc. along with route updates whenever necessary."
PaLM,cmv-229,"I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing from this practice, and it can actually be quite confusing. For example, let's say a store is selling a shirt for $20. If the store were to simply mark the shirt down to $10, that would be a clear and straightforward discount. However, if the store were to mark the shirt up to $30 and then offer a ""sale"" price of $20, the consumer might be fooled into thinking that they are getting a better deal than they actually are. In reality, the consumer is still paying the same $20 for the shirt, but they are being tricked into thinking that they are getting a 33% discount. This is because the original price of $30 was artificially inflated. This practice is known as ""psychological pricing,"" and it is a common marketing tactic used by retailers to boost sales. By setting a high ""original"" price and then offering a ""discount,"" retailers can make consumers feel like they are getting a good deal, even when they are not. Psychological pricing can be especially effective on consumers who are not good at math or who are easily swayed by sales pitches. For these consumers, the illusion of a discount can be enough to convince them to buy something that they might not otherwise have purchased. Of course, not all psychological pricing is deceptive. Sometimes, retailers will legitimately offer discounts on products. However, it is important to be aware of the psychological effects of pricing, so that you can make informed decisions about your purchases. Here are some tips for avoiding being tricked by psychological pricing:  Be aware of the ""original"" price. This is the price that the retailer is using to justify the ""discount."" If the original price is artificially inflated, then the discount is not as great as it seems.  Compare prices between different retailers. This is the best way to ensure that you are getting the best possible deal.  Don't be afraid to walk away from a sale. If you're not sure whether a product is worth the price, it's better to pass on it than to regret your purchase later."

OpenAI,cmv-229,"I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing Yes, you are correct. Psychological pricing - where prices are set at numbers that are perceived as ""lower"" or ""better value"" by consumers - is a common tactic used by businesses to influence their customers' perceptions and purchasing decisions. While this can be an effective way to make a product appear more attractive to consumers, it is important for businesses to remain transparent and honest in their pricing. Otherwise, it can erode trust and hurt the business's long-term reputation."
Human,cmv-229,"I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise. I would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the 599.99 store than the 600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the ""real market price"" just happened to stop at that arbitrary.99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition. Therefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned. I can see how that might cause problems with prices like 19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference. If you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott. And if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale. You would probably change my view if you present a convincing central reason for stores to do this that isn't purely manipulative. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The car costs 75k, so if the battery is the same price, the car should be 100k. thecleaner Huh, didn't think about that.

MichaelGG That doesn't work in Chrome at least. If you copy the full URL it doesn't autocomplete. briandear I really hope this is a marketing ploy.

Tesla's been one of the most interesting companies I've been following for a while now. gfodor Congrats to Tesla for the new Model S, but I can't help but feel that the 'affordable luxury' moniker is a bit of a marketing ploy on their part. I don't really see the point of selling a car for 75,000 when they're already selling a car for 50,000. I'd imagine most people who'd buy the 50,000 version would be happy with the 75,000 version too, so there's not really much incentive for Tesla to move that 25,000 dollar margin. It seems to me like a great example of why ""not for profit"" should be considered a marketing slogan, not a business strategy. bruceboughton This is a little off-topic but I find it interesting that you don't see the point of selling a car for 50k when they're already selling a car for 75k."

Tsinghua,cmv-230,"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. This was because the only way they could win was to break the treaty which prevented their country from doing anything about the problem of Hitler. In this case, the treaty was one that they had helped to create and then signed. If the US had refused to go along with it, they would have found themselves up against a superior army and navy, and possibly also a country with better industrial capacity. If they had gone ahead and used nuclear weapons, it would have created a world with nuclear weapons, and possibly also a world with the Soviet Union as the dominant power. This was a world which they did not want, and I think that the end result would have been the same. But at least they would have faced the prospect of a world with an alternative to the USA. So I think that America has had a positive effect on the world in a number of ways, but at the end of the day it was a losing battle, because the decision to use nuclear weapons would have led to a world with nuclear weapons. 2016-03-23 You can get a short-cut to some of the longer essays by using the search facility at the top right of this page.

PaLM,cmv-230,"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. Here is why:  The war did not achieve its stated goals. The Allies went to war with the stated goal of defeating Nazi Germany and establishing a lasting peace. However, the war did not achieve either of these goals. Nazi Germany was defeated, but only after it had caused massive death and destruction across Europe. Moreover, the peace that followed the war was far from lasting. The Cold War began only a few years after the end of the war, and it lasted for nearly half a century.  The war led to the rise of communism. The Soviet Union emerged from the war as a superpower, and it used its newfound power to spread communism throughout Eastern Europe. This led to the Cold War, which was a time of great tension and conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The war caused a great deal of suffering. The war resulted in the deaths of millions of people, both soldiers and civilians. It also caused widespread destruction, both physical and psychological. The war left a legacy of trauma that has lasted for generations. In short, the second World War was a disaster for the world. It did not achieve its stated goals, it led to the rise of communism, and it caused a great deal of suffering. I believe that the Allies ultimately lost the war, even though they were victorious on the battlefield. Some people might argue that the Allies did not lose the war because they achieved their goal of defeating Nazi Germany. However, I believe that this is a superficial view of the war. The war was about more than just defeating Nazi Germany. It was also about establishing a lasting peace and preventing the rise of communism. The Allies failed to achieve these goals, and as a result, the world is still suffering from the consequences of the war today. I also believe that the Allies lost the war in terms of the human cost. The war resulted in the deaths of millions of people, both soldiers and civilians. It also caused widespread destruction, both physical and psychological. The war left a legacy of trauma that has lasted for generations. In conclusion, I believe that the Allies ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The war did not achieve its stated goals, it led to the rise of communism, and it caused a great deal of suffering. The world is still suffering from the consequences of the war today. Here are some additional thoughts on why I believe that the Allies ultimately lost the second World War:  The Allies were not prepared for the war. They were caught off guard by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and they were slow to mobilize their forces. This gave the Axis powers a head start, and it made it more difficult for the Allies to win the war.  The Allies were divided. The United States and the Soviet Union were often at odds with each other during the war. This made it difficult for them to coordinate their efforts, and it gave the Axis powers an advantage.  The Allies made some strategic mistakes. For example, they invaded North Africa at a time when they were already stretched thin in Europe. This invasion diverted resources from the main theater of war, and it allowed the Germans to win some important victories. In short, I believe that the Allies ultimately lost the second World War because they were not prepared for the war, they were divided, and they made some strategic mistakes. The war did not achieve its stated goals, it led to the rise of communism, and it caused a great deal of suffering. The world is still suffering from the consequences of the war today."
Human,cmv-230,"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal militarypolitical goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II. What I am arguing is that, having'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order. I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power. Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess. What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

LLAMA,cmv-230,"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. We lost our own sovereignty and had our national economies overthrown by the same rapacious bankers that had started and funded the war from the beginning. America was never the same again. The war turned the government into the enemy of the people. Today we see a direct line from the 1930s to today's crisis. And what is so frustrating is that the majority of people are completely oblivious to what happened in the past and are, therefore, incapable of seeing it in front of them today. The second World War was, at its core, an economic war. And as such, it was an unmitigated disaster for the Western world. It is important to remember that the US and USSR were not the only ones to lose the war. The British Empire lost its colonies, its trade routes, and its prestige. It's hard to imagine today, but in 1939, the British Empire was the undisputed financial and military superpower of the world. At the time, the UK was also the world's banker. London was the financial epicenter of the world. And sterling was the primary reserve currency. Today, the UK is an economic basket case, and sterling is a complete non-factor. On the other hand, the United States emerged from the war as the dominant superpower. The US quickly became the world's largest creditor and its primary banker. The US dollar was the world's reserve currency. And, by the end of the 1940s, America had captured roughly 50 of the global economy, an all-time high. But this dominance was short-lived. By the 1970s, the US had ceded its economic position to Japan. And today, the dollar is under attack as a legitimate reserve currency. One has to wonder whether this outcome was planned. This is something that will never be taught in history class, but the first and second World Wars were, at their core, economic wars. The first World War turned Europe upside down. It redrew the map of Europe, and it transferred substantial power from the old, established European empires to the upstart United States. The second World War was a continuation of the first, and it finalized this transfer of power. The UK, France, and Germany all lost enormous amounts of wealth. Russia was bankrupted. And, the United States, who entered the war late, emerged from the war as the undisputed economic superpower. In 1944, at the end of the war, the US held 75 of the world's gold reserves. After the war, the US also held a monopoly over the world's oil trade. And, the US dollar, which had been backed by gold since the 1870s, was the world's reserve currency. At that point, the US government had a choice: 1) They could have used all of this leverage to rebuild the world, forgive debts, invest in a new era of science and prosperity, etc. 2) Or they could take advantage of their newfound power and use it to control the world. Unfortunately, they chose option 2. Since the end of World War II, the United States has done more to advance its own interests at the expense of everyone else than any other country in history. At first, this was easy. The US owned most of the world's gold, so they could dictate terms to the rest of the world. As the rest of the world recovered in the 1950s and 1960s, the US used the dollar as a weapon to ensure compliance. Any foreign country that was not in line with the US government's objectives would see their currency decline relative to the US dollar, thus creating inflation in their country. They would also be denied any US aid, and in some cases even be denied access to the US market. By the 1970s, a number of foreign countries had had enough. The French government of Charles de Gaulle was the first to realize that the US government was using the dollar to control the world, and they started to ask for payment of their debts in gold rather than dollars. This was a genius move by the French. By asking for payment in gold, the French"
LLAMA,cmv-231,"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured to give up her last name in marriage. But at the same time, this last name crap is getting out of control. In the last month alone, I've met a ""Jane Doe Smith,"" a ""Jane Smith Jones,"" and an ""Amber Smith Jones."" That's three people with four names. And let me tell you, none of these people are aristocrats. They're all young, from the South, and, except for ""Jane,"" are women. There's nothing wrong with having two last names. It just seems like the more I meet people, the more I come across people with two last names. I also encounter people with hyphenated last names. There's something that's becoming increasingly more commonplace in America, and I'm not sure if it's a good thing. Why do I care? First of all, it's a pain in the ass to type. Second, it's annoying to say. I'm also a bit tired of the implication that a woman who takes a man's last name in marriage is somehow betraying feminism. I'm not so sure I'm a fan of hyphenated last names. They also pose a lot of annoyances. Hyphenated last names cause problems with initials, on forms, and when you have kids. If you hyphenate your last name, you're also hyphenating your kids' last names. There are certain situations where your kids will have to take one last name or the other. I wonder how kids will deal with this in the future. My last name is ""Glatt."" If my daughter grows up and marries a guy with a long last name, her kids will have a pretty long last name. My last name is ""Glatt."" If she marries a guy with a short last name, her kids will have a short last name. There's also the question of what last name my grandkids will take if their parents have hyphenated last names. Will they take one or the other, or will they hyphenate the hyphenated names? I've noticed that a lot of women are changing their last names back to their maiden names when they get divorced. That's all fine and dandy, but then they have to get used to a new last name, and if they ever get married again, they'll have to make another adjustment. There's also the question of how last names will evolve in the future. We're living in an age where gay marriage is becoming increasingly more accepted. What will happen to last names in gay marriages? If two women get married, will they hyphenate their last names? What about two guys? I'm not advocating that all women take their husbands' last names, but I do wonder if things are getting a little out of control. I've also noticed that a lot of famous women are taking their husbands' last names. Is this a trend? Have we come full circle? Have we come to a point where it's socially acceptable to give up your last name when you get married? I don't think any woman should be pressured into giving up her last name when she gets married. But I also think that if you're going to take your husband's last name, it should be a choice, not a stance on feminism. I've been married for a little over a year now, and I've been using my wife's last name on certain forms. But it just doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel like my name. It feels like it's not me. I don't think I'm ever going to change my last name. I feel like it's a part of me, and if I gave it up, I'd be betraying my identity. My wife's last name is ""Glatt,"" and that means a lot to me. It means that she's a part of me. But she's not my last name."
Human,cmv-231,"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper. BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideassocial structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. EDIT: Apologies for the day long delay car emergency took all night and all morning. Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. Spain 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my ""one family name"" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. I also want to clarify: My problem with the ""mouthful"" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to ""People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don't understand are selfish and stupid."" You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated. You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here. Thanks guys!"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-231,"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into dating someone just for security reasons or financial stability."" The word ""just"" in that sentence doesn't bode well either; if you don t want to date me then why did we even start talking? In my humble opinion though: Why are all men so afraid and insecure about their masculinity when it comes down being manly around women (and girls)? If they can deal on an intellectual level but must act macho towards us as some sort protection mechanism...then what's wrong exactly?! It never ceases amazes how many self-proclaimed intellectuals will quote Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi Mahatma Ghandi while using demeaning language like ""slut"" 'bout any female over which he has no power whatsoever! And where does these sense come from?? What happens inside young boys minds during puberty???? These same types say nothing against Rape Culture!!!!! On top off this - who says black males aren'l also equally guilty by doing things such profile buildingsoulless marketing tactics!!!!"
Tsinghua,cmv-231,"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured to use a man's name. But on the other hand, when a man goes out of his way to give a woman his name, I'm sure he has a reason. I once dated a guy who used to write me all the time, saying, ""I'm sure I'll see you at the library."" But he was working for a company that had a branch library, so it made no sense. I'm sure he meant to say ""I'm sure I'll see you at the library where I work."" So, in the end, I gave up on him. I'm very open-minded, but I do think that women have to be the ones who decide if they want to use a man's name. They can use a man's name if they want to. And if a man wants to use a woman's name, I'm sure he has a good reason. I can't think of a good reason. In the early days of courtship, men used to give women their last names so that they would be recognized in public. So they'd say, ""Oh, this is Mrs. Jones."" It's the same reason people used to marry people who had the same name as their children. They didn't want to be recognized by their first names, because it would be embarrassing. I'm not sure I agree with the idea of a man's last name. I don't know any women who use their husbands' names. And I'm not sure that a man would want to use a woman's name, anyway. I don't think a man would want to use his wife's name because it would look like he was trying to hide his identity. He might want to use his own name. I've been called a lot of things in my life, but I've never been called a man. I've been called a woman, but never a man. That's funny. A man would be a good last name. It's more of a masculine name. And it's more of a name for a man than a woman. So, I think a man would be a good last name. A man's name is a good last name. It's not a good first name. It's a good last name. It's not a good first name. I'm not sure that a man's name would work as a last name. I think it's too much of a masculine name. But I think it would be a good first name.

When you spot someone who looks like you on TV and think that they are too good for their own skin (and not talented enough to know better), what would your reaction be? My mother has an appraisal company but couldn't tell me why it's in her name. (Her father didn't want it there). I've had plenty of friends where everyone camps out on weekends and then disappears back home until another weekend when they're all together again. They don't care about each other or even remember YOU being around! What book or movie was most unexpectedly profound? And by how much? A film called The Help could be anywhere between meaningful and utterly incomprehensible...but I'm going in as if I am familiar with its premise.

Tsinghua,cmv-232,"If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get my PC to play through a campaign with my wife, we can start playing a new one whenever we want. If I get a console, we'll have to wait for a new one, or play the game we already have on the console. This means we'll have to wait longer to play a new game. Is that a fair trade? Does it matter if we get the game first or later? (We'll play at different times, so it's not like we're playing together.) What if we play the same game on different consoles? I'm guessing the answer is no, and that we'll be playing our games as they're released. Am I missing something? Edit: Sorry for not including more information in the first place.

PaLM,cmv-233,"I believe that ""Buckle up, it's the law"" is a very bad slogan, because it is an appeal to authority which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they have negative feelings towards authority. An appeal to authority is a logical fallacy in which the validity of an argument is based on the authority of the person making the argument rather than on the strength of the argument itself. In the case of ""Buckle up, it's the law,"" the authority being appealed to is the law. However, laws are not always right or just, and people may have valid reasons for disobeying them. For example, a person may not want to wear a seatbelt because they believe it is uncomfortable or because they do not believe it is necessary. If a person has negative feelings towards authority, they are more likely to reject the argument that ""Buckle up, it's the law"" because they do not trust the authority that is being appealed to. A better slogan would be one that appeals to the individual's own self-interest. For example, ""Buckle up, it could save your life."" This slogan emphasizes the benefits of wearing a seatbelt, rather than the fact that it is the law. It also appeals to the individual's desire to protect themselves, which is a stronger motivation than the desire to obey authority.

Tsinghua,cmv-233,"I believe that ""Buckle up, it's the law"" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they have been exposed to it as a stereotype, which is what I think we've been doing. The thing that is most successful is ""It's your life."" You're much more likely to accept that than the law, and you're much more likely to accept that than the safety expert, who's not a representative of the law. I'm not saying that people are stupid. I'm saying that when we're in our daily lives, when we make our decisions, when we make our plans, we're much more influenced by our emotional responses than by what our rational mind is telling us. But you can use that emotional response to help us. You can use that emotional response to motivate people to change. And you can use that emotional response to make it easier for people to make changes that they might not otherwise make. Q: You talk about being shocked at how bad our system is. What's your solution? A: I would like to see a federal agency, or a national campaign, that would set up a hotline, so that people could call in to a number and report all the unsafe and unhealthy things that they see in their neighborhoods. There should be a public health database that's searchable, so that people could go online and find out where the fast-food restaurants are. There should be a database of the places where you could go to exercise, where you could go to the library, where you could go to the public swimming pool, where you could go to the public playground, and so forth. There should be a database of all the places where people can go to get healthful foods, and then they should be able to make their own choices. I don't want to take away people's freedom to choose. I just want to make sure that they have a range of options, so that they can make the choices that are best for them. Q: There are a lot of people who think it's not the government's role to tell people what to do. What do you say to them? A: I'm not saying that government should run everything. I'm saying that it should run the things that we value, the things that are good for us, the things that are healthful, the things that are safe. It's the government's job to make sure that we have good roads, and that we have good schools, and that we have good parks. The government's job is to make sure that we have the things that make us happy. I think that we have too many things that make us unhappy, and that are harmful to our health. Q: What's the difference between you and the president? A: Well, I think that we agree on the things that are good for our country, but we disagree on the things that are bad for our country. Q: Why is the president so opposed to making changes to our health-care system? A: I think that there are a lot of things that he is doing right. I think that he is helping to bring down the cost of health care. I think that he is making sure that people have access to health care. I think that he is trying to improve the quality of health care. But I think that he is missing a key point: that people are suffering because of the costs of health care. And I think that if we can bring down the costs of health care, people will have more money to spend on the things that they really value, the things that are good for their health. Q: So if you're the president, you'd change the law? A: Yes, I would. Q: What are you going to do? A: I'm going to bring down the cost of health care, by changing the way that health care is financed. I think that the government should pay for the things that it values, the things that it thinks are good for people. So if the government is paying for the things that it values, the people will be willing to pay for the things that they value. So we're going to change the way that health care is financed, so that we're going to get a lot more money for the things that are good for people. And we're going to reduce the cost of health care. We're going to reduce the cost of health care by improving the quality of health care. Q: How do you think the government can improve the quality of health care? A: By reducing the costs of health care. By improving the quality of health care, the people will have more money to spend on the things that they really value."

If you want to learn about a candidate's policies and qualifications, it's better to do your own research and read their platforms and past actions. Debates tend to focus on sound bites and theatrics rather than substantive discussions. That being said, the column you mentioned lays out an interesting idea for an alternative format for debates. By having candidates answer questions in writing and publishing their responses, voters can get a more detailed look at their positions and thought processes. This format could also potentially level the playing field for candidates who are not as skilled in public speaking or who may not have as much media attention. Overall, the important thing is to do your own research and not rely solely on debates or media coverage to inform your political decisions."

A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President. We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs. This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility. If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations. As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.

Tsinghua,cmv-234,"So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to have a good debate, the format should be something like this: a debate panel, the audience, and then the candidates, and a big-screen showing a side-by-side comparison of how they would have done in the hypothetical case that they were running against each other. I'm also quite wary of politicians' talking about their ""core values"" in debates. I'm not sure how to define those, but the way I'd do it would be to ask them to make up their own definition of a core value and then try to talk about why that's important to them. If you can't do that, I'd say you don't really have a core value. For example, ""core values"" is often associated with ""family values"" in the US, and it's not clear that it's a good idea to associate politicians with such vague, broad-brush values. It's also not clear what would happen if a politician didn't have a ""core value"" that matched what people thought it was. jonnathanson I think you're doing a good job of defining ""core values."" But I think you're also oversimplifying the matter. And your basic approach, of bringing up the hypothetical case, is also problematic. The core values of a politician are often at odds with the core values of the public. In fact, many times they're the defining characteristic of the politician. Take, for instance, two different candidates: Romney and Obama. Contrast their ""core values."" (I'm using the word ""values"" loosely, to mean what's most important to the politician.) If Romney had ""core values,"" they'd look a lot like the values of the GOP. And if Obama had ""core values,"" they'd look a lot like the values of the Democratic Party. In fact, Romney's values are in direct opposition to Obama's. So how would you define Romney's core values? And how would you define Obama's core values? Would Romney's ""core values"" be ""spreading the wealth""? Or ""getting tough on crime""? Or ""cut taxes for the wealthy""? And how would you define Obama's ""core values""? ""Stimulating the economy""? ""Supporting working families""? ""Protecting the environment""? ""Insuring the uninsured""? ""Supporting veterans""? And, if you were to bet your life on the outcome of a hypothetical presidential election, which candidate would you choose? (This hypothetical is a bit more complex, but I think the core question is relevant.) dave1010uk You have to assume that the core values are the values the politician would use to govern if elected. What we're talking about here is how they would govern. They may not have ""core values"" in the sense of a philosophy, but in the sense of a governing approach. jonnathanson That's the point. We can't know how they'd govern if elected. We can only guess. dave1010uk Yep, which is why I said 'assume'. And even then, we can't be sure. What is the chance that the 'core values' of a politician are the same as the values of the public? The more extreme the politician, the more different they are. yuhong ""If I'm right, then all this new-fangled ""super-PACs"" and ""independent expenditure"" stuff is just a figment of people's imaginations, and there's nothing to it."" I think that the US system is very much like the Chinese one. However, the US system has more money available, and people spend more time on this, so the government spends more time on this. shawndumas the US system has more money available, and people spend more time on this, so the government spends more time on this. The question is, how much money? yuhong I'm not sure how much money the US government spends, but it is very likely that China spends more than the US. In fact, I think China has more than double the GDP of the US. shawndumas Not sure how much money the Chinese government spends, but I'm pretty sure it's a lot less than the US government. aespinoza The GOP is mostly about Tea Party. The Tea Party is mostly about Republicans. Republicans are mostly about big government. It's not really about policy, it's about the Party."
LLAMA,cmv-234,"So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to know about a candidate's positions, you can read them on the web. The debates are a good place to hear the candidates respond to rapid fire questions, but that's all they're good for. As I read the column, I thought he was going to suggest that the debates be structured differently. I have a few ideas on how I would structure them. Then he went in a different direction. He suggested that the debates be replaced with a test. I disagree. The problem with any test is that it favors people who are good at taking tests. We've all heard stories of people who are good at taking tests, but not very good at doing what they are tested on. The second problem is that it's very difficult to come up with good questions that test what you want to test. In an ideal world, the questions would be about specific situations that are relevant to the position. But how do you come up with questions that are applicable to a wide range of situations? It's extremely difficult, especially when you consider that a lot of the situations are hidden from the public eye and that the candidate will likely have a lot of advisors to help them make decisions. I think the answer is to just eliminate the debates altogether. The only reason they exist is because people want to see the candidates in action. That's all a waste of time. We have this thing called the Internet. Candidates can use the Internet to post video clips of themselves in action. Sure, the candidates can put out whatever clips they want. But so what? That's no different than what they do in the debates. We still don't get to see them reacting to a full range of situations. We still don't get to see how they work with a team to make decisions. The problem isn't the format of the debate. The problem is that no format can provide a comprehensive test of how a candidate will react in a specific situation. The best we can do is look at the candidate's history and see how they reacted to similar situations. It would be a lot more useful for the candidates to post video clips of themselves in action on the Internet. We'd be able to see the full range of their positions and how they reacted in a variety of situations. We'd get to see them interacting with people. We'd see them trying to accomplish things. One of the things that really struck me in the last debate was how calm and confident McCain was. I know he has a lot of experience, but I'd never seen him in action. The debates are a great place to show that. But do we really need to see it live? It seems to me that we should just eliminate the debates and let the candidates create their own clips and post them on the Internet. That would give us the best of both worlds. We would be able to see the candidates in action and we wouldn't have to waste time watching them read off answers to questions that they've had plenty of time to prepare for. What do you think? Should we get rid of the debates?"
PaLM,cmv-234,"So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to learn about a candidate, you’re better off reading their website, their policy proposals, and their speeches. Debates are designed to be entertaining, not informative. They’re a chance for the candidates to show off their charisma and their ability to think on their feet. But they’re not a good way to get a sense of their actual policies or their plans for the country. For one thing, debates are very short. Candidates only have a few minutes to make their points, and they’re often interrupted by the moderators or by other candidates. This makes it difficult for them to go into any real detail about their policies. Second, debates are often very chaotic. There are multiple candidates on stage, all trying to talk at once. This makes it difficult to follow the conversation, and it’s easy for candidates to get lost in the shuffle. Third, debates are often more about scoring points than about actually discussing the issues. Candidates are trying to win the debate, not to have a serious discussion about the future of the country. This means that they’re more likely to focus on attacking their opponents than on explaining their own policies. As a result, debates are often more about style than substance. Candidates can win a debate by being charismatic and quick-witted, even if they don’t have any real substance to their arguments. This is why it’s so important to look beyond the debates when you’re trying to learn about a candidate. If you want to learn about a candidate’s policies, read their website and their policy proposals. If you want to learn about their plans for the country, listen to their speeches. And if you want to get a sense of their character, watch their interviews. Debates are a fun way to watch candidates interact with each other, but they’re not a good way to learn about their policies or their plans for the country. If you want to make an informed decision about who to vote for, you need to look beyond the debates."
LLAMA,cmv-235,"I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the facts. According to the Meat and Livestock Australia, sheep have been a part of Australia's culture since the first flock was brought to Australia in 1788. By 1820, sheep numbers exceeded 1 million, by 1830 over 2 million, by 1840 over 10 million and by 1850 over 18 million. Sheep farming continues to be an important part of Australia's economy with about 70 million sheep currently in Australia. The most common breeds of sheep in Australia are Merino sheep (for wool), Crossbred sheep (for meat), White Suffolk sheep (for meat) and Dorper sheep (for meat). Merino sheep were originally brought to Australia from Spain in 1797. They are very hardy sheep, and have been bred to be able to survive in the harsh conditions of the Australian climate. They are the most common breed of sheep in Australia, and are primarily used for wool. Crossbred sheep are the result of crossing the Merino sheep with the Border Leicester sheep. This results in a hybrid sheep with the hardiness of the Merino sheep, but with an increased meat yield. These sheep are typically used for meat. White Suffolk sheep are bred for meat, with a focus on producing high quality meat. Dorper sheep are a breed of sheep that have been developed in South Africa for use in arid climates. They have been bred to survive in the harsh conditions of the Australian climate, and they also produce high quality meat. Merino sheep are the most commonly kept sheep in Australia, and are typically kept for wool production. Lambs are typically weaned at about 4 months, and may be sold to farms that are focused on meat production. Lambs that are raised for meat are typically farmed on open pastures. They are allowed to graze on pastures, but they are also given feed to supplement their diet and improve the quality of their meat. The lambs are sent to the abattoir at about 6 months of age, but it is possible for lambs to be sent to the abattoir at any time after 4 months. The lambs are generally raised in groups of 10-15, with a lambing percentage of 95-105. The lambs are typically removed from the sheep at 2 days, and are then raised by the farmers. The sheep are sheared at about 12 months of age, and the wool is sold to companies that process and sell wool. After about 5 years, the sheep are sold to the abattoir. The sheep are sheared about once a year. Shearing takes place in a shed, with a number of sheep sheared at the same time. At the abattoir, the sheep are stunned using a captive bolt gun. The sheep are then bled, and skinned. The sheep are then sent to a processor where they are processed into cuts of meat, and packaged for sale. Where are the sheep raised? Sheep are typically raised in large open paddocks. The sheep are typically not kept in sheds, but rather are kept in large open paddocks. Sheep prefer to be able to see other sheep and to have space to run around, so this type of farming is ideal for sheep. Sheep farmers raise their sheep on a combination of open pasture and feed. The sheep graze on pasture, but are also fed to supplement their diet. Typically the sheep are grazed in large open paddocks during the day, and then brought into a yard at night. This is done to prevent predators from attacking the sheep while they are sleeping. Sheep are very social creatures, and prefer to live in groups. They like to have the company of other sheep, and are also very curious and love to explore. Sheep are very intelligent animals and will explore their environment when they are given the opportunity. They have been known to climb trees, and are also very good at escaping from pens. Sheep enjoy the company of other sheep, and like to be able to see and hear other sheep. They also prefer to have room to move around, as they enjoy being able to walk around and explore. Sheep like to feel safe and secure, and prefer to have access to shelter in the event of extreme weather conditions. Sheep"

PaLM,cmv-235,"Meat consumption is a major contributor to climate change, and lamb meat is one of the worst offenders. Lamb produces more greenhouse gases per kilogram than any other type of meat, including beef, pork, and chicken. This is because sheep are ruminants, which means they produce methane gas as a byproduct of their digestion. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25 times greater than carbon dioxide. The meat industry also contributes to deforestation, water pollution, and water scarcity. Sheep farming requires large amounts of land, and much of this land is cleared for grazing. This deforestation can lead to habitat loss for wildlife and can also contribute to climate change. The meat industry also uses a lot of water, both for irrigation and for cleaning livestock facilities. This can lead to water shortages in areas where water is already scarce. Lamb meat is also a poor source of nutrition. It is high in saturated fat and cholesterol, and it is also a major source of dietary iron. Eating too much red meat has been linked to a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and cancer. There are many delicious and healthy plant-based alternatives to lamb meat. Beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh are all excellent sources of protein, and they are much lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than lamb meat. These foods can be used in a variety of dishes, and they can easily be substituted for lamb meat in recipes. If you are concerned about the environmental and health impacts of eating lamb meat, there are many delicious and healthy alternatives available to you.

BigScience,cmv-235,"I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the facts. The word ""vegetarian"" is derived from Latin verb terere which means ""to feed someone who eats"" or ""to serve something for meals."" As you all know Lamb is a type of livestock that primarily feeds on grass. So technically speaking we could say that a lamb or other animals that eat grass are vegetarian in nature. However when they reach adulthood these animals become omnivores making them part carnivore and part herbivore. A true vegetarian can only choose not to consume animal products such as milk, eggs, fish and poultry (excluding egg shells) while maintaining a healthy lifestyle so hisher body does not get deprived of any essential nutrients. If one chooses to eat foods low in protein he will automatically go into ketosis mode where most energy comes from burning fat rather than glucose sources (carbs), hence HeShe may need supplementation if needed. All Vegetarians do NOT have to follow strict diets. What matters here is the food choices made by each individual. For example even an omnivorous person likes to indulge occasionally in sugary snacks sweetened drinks etc but heshe knows how much shehe should limit herhis consumption every day. On the contrary, a vegan might dedicate more time to exercise and try to maintain weights off or at least track their weight gain via Fitbit or Garmin app). If there were no health risks associated then one wouldn't expect anyone to restrict themselves. We just don't understand why people feel guilt over choosing certain types of food simply due to being aware about what goes inside those containers! The best thing to do is find out your current diet habits along with ingredients used in everyday life - cooking oil's, breads, doughnuts, chemicals added to grains... Then make sure you consume lots of vegetables and fruits daily - both raw and cooked form. Also keep changing up your menu now and again. Try different combinations of flavors so you never get bored of just doing same old things always There has been some confusion between 'healthy fats','saturated fatty acids' polyunsaturated fatty acids ' (PUFA). Saturated fatty acids come mainly from processed meats oils; whereas PUFAs mostly fall under the category of plant-based fats; found in extra virgin olive oil, almond oil, coconut oil among others. They increase levels of LDL cholesterol, leading towards risk factors for heart disease and stroke."
Human,cmv-235,"I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with why I find eating meat at all to be morally justifiable. I only buy meat from free-roam organic farms, which are clearly labeled here in Denmark. If I eat one of the cows I see on the outskirts of my city, happily roaming and eating grass, I don't really feel guilty. They get to experience a reasonably long, happy and healthy life. We also have pigs that are allowed to roam free in the forest. We give them a safe environment, and their lives end up on average longer and happier than they would be in the wild. So imagine if an alien species came to earth and says: ""Hey, we'll create a post-scarcity society for you. All your life you will be in perfect health. You (as in all humans) will never want for anything, you will get all your favorite food and you get to play video games all day or whatever it is you want to do. But when you reach the age of 50, we will kill you in a humane way and then we will eat your corpse."" I would find that to be a good deal. It would remove world hunger, there is no need to fight for resources. No diseases killing young people, no genetic defects. Not even having to work or do anything you don't want. And you would still get a reasonably long life to enjoy. And now we get to lamb meat. These guys are killed at 1 month to 1 year, which is in the best case less then 110th of their lives. They don't get to enjoy their lives. In my alien analogy, it would be like making the deal ""Yeah some of you get to live until 50, but some of you we will take and eat at 5,"" which suddenly becomes less acceptable. What would change my view: Somehow making my alien analogy work for eating humans at 5 Giving me another compelling moral argument for why eating lamb meat is ok. What will NOT change my view: The ""Animals are made for human consumption so they don't matter"" argument. Well yes, but they are also intelligent agents capable of feeling pain and suffering. An alien species with superior technology and intelligence could decide that ""Humans are made for alien consumption,"" and enslave our species, keeping us in cages all our lives. That would be horrible. So even if they are less intelligent and feel suffering differently, it does not give us the right to harm them for no good reason. We as a species get to decide which animals are for human consumption and which aren't, and what conditions we keep them in. The ""we evolved to eat meat"" argument. Yes, and we can eat chicken, pork and beef. No need to eat lamb even if a vegetarian diet was insufficient. Sorry for the long post. I realize it may be a bit tricky, but I really really want my guilt-free lamb roast. So there you have it, my first ever CMV:) EDIT: Thank you all for the replies! So this has been addressed from 2 perspectives, that got me to change my view: 1. If we go with the alien analogy, if they were to take some human cells and clone some humans on their home world, let them play happily on a field until they are 5, and then slaughter them for food, how immoral would that really be? The children would accept it as the status-quo and enjoy their lives, as they are too young to understand all the ramifications. No parents would have to part from their children, thus causing more suffering. 2. On the other side, it has been shown that other animals are slaughtered at an even younger age, so my view is inconsistent. Pigs, who are a lot more intelligent than lambs, usually get killed at 5 months. Milk cows are parted from their young as soon as they are born, and the calves get killed quite often only after a few weeks. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I don't know much about lamb meat, but it seems to me that it has less fat than beef. It has a similar amount of protein, so it's probably leaner.

The consequences would have been worse if someone had revealed our national secrets while we were asleep, or even when we went on vacation somewhere else. Imagine if an intelligence officer went out into the country for two weeks without telling his superiors about this fact? What kind of international relations do we expect from the US? Another point: what's all these people who complain that Snowden has already lied before?

Tsinghua,cmv-236,"Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not leak the information in order to harm our country. He leaked it because he believed it was important to reveal. And as such, it was the public interest, and he is entitled to a pardon. But the decision is ultimately the President's, and I respect the President's right to make that decision. But if the President does not pardon Snowden, then the question will become: Why not? And in my view, there is a good reason not to pardon him: Snowden is an anti-American traitor. He betrayed his oath of office, his oath of loyalty to this country, and he betrayed the American people. He violated the trust that we all placed in him when he took an oath to protect and defend our Constitution. That is why he deserves to be tried for treason. That is why he deserves to be punished for treason. And that is why I believe that Snowden is deserving of a pardon. Snowden is not a victim. He is a perpetrator. He is a traitor."
OpenAI,cmv-236,"Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not follow the proper channels for reporting his concerns about government surveillance programs, but instead chose to go to the media. However, it is important to consider that Snowden believed that the scale of government surveillance was so vast and invasive that he had a moral obligation to disclose this information to the public. His actions brought attention to important issues related to privacy and government surveillance. It is worth noting that there are arguments for and against pardoning Snowden. Some argue that he committed a serious crime and should face legal consequences, while others believe that his actions can be justified as a form of civil disobedience. Ultimately, it will be up to policymakers and officials to weigh these arguments and decide whether or not to offer Snowden a pardon."
LLAMA,cmv-236,"Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not want to be a hero or martyr, but he had to make a choice: whether to do nothing and see the NSA continue to run amok or whether to try to stop the madness by leaking the classified information. He took the latter path and, in doing so, he relied upon the advice of legal counsel and submitted to the laws of a sovereign country. In other words, he followed the advice of lawyers and the law, and he did so in good faith. He was unaware of any law that required him to turn over the documents to his superiors and, if he had, he probably would have done so. Snowden believed that he had a moral and legal obligation to the public and he believed that the public had a right to know. He was not some whistleblower. He was not trying to reveal secrets in order to embarrass his bosses or his agency. He was simply trying to get the word out about what the NSA was doing in the hopes of sparking a much-needed debate about government surveillance. Snowden's decision to leak the information was as much a risk to him as it was to the NSA. If the NSA had been smart, it would have simply thanked Snowden for bringing the issue to light. But instead, the NSA chose to go after Snowden with everything it had. Snowden made the right choice in not giving the information to the NSA. He had no idea what the NSA would have done with it. Snowden leaked the information to journalists who published it, allowing the American people to make an informed decision about the issue. One of the biggest objections to pardoning Snowden is that he fled the country and he is now in Russia. But there is a perfectly valid reason for Snowden to have fled the country. In addition to not trusting the NSA, Snowden did not trust the US government. Snowden believed that the government would hunt him down and punish him for his actions. Snowden was right. Snowden sought asylum in Russia in part because the US had revoked his passport and in part because he believed that he would not be given a fair trial in the US. Snowden was right. He would not have received a fair trial in the US. Any trial of Snowden would have become a referendum on government surveillance and a conviction would have been a foregone conclusion. Snowden's fate would have been the same as that of Chelsea Manning. Manning leaked classified information to WikiLeaks. Manning was arrested, tried, and convicted. Snowden would have suffered the same fate. Snowden has been accused of being a spy for Russia. But there is no evidence to support that claim. Russia could not have treated Snowden worse if he was a spy. Snowden has been forced to live in a tiny apartment in Moscow and has been unable to work or make a living. Russia has not rewarded Snowden for his actions. There is no reason for Snowden to remain in Russia. He has done everything he could to inform the American people and to spark a debate about government surveillance. He has been pardoned by people all over the world. He deserves to be pardoned by his own country. A pardon of Snowden would not preclude the government from bringing charges against him. He could be arrested, tried, and convicted. But the government should not hold that threat over his head. A pardon would allow Snowden to return to the US and make a living. It would allow him to live a normal life. Snowden deserves to be pardoned. It is time for the US to make that happen."

If he had not been a national security employee, his actions would have been covered by the whistleblower protection act, and not be a crime at all. Two years on from his leaks, it is clear that Snowden has not acted in a way deserving of legal punishment, and it would be better for the United States if he were to be pardoned and allowed to return home, instead of his looming prosecution, especially considering that [he could not raise a public interest defense] at trial. Snowden broke the law. But the pardon power exists precisely because the law does not cover all possible contingencies, and there is supposed to be the possibility of mercy in an exceptional case. Snowden's case is nothing if not exceptional, and he should be pardoned. Edit: Ok, I'm heading to bed now. Thanks for all the responses, I'll try to catch up on more tomorrow - this thread kinda blew up on me. Edit 2: I've awarded a delta to uMrApophenia who convinced me that the first-best solution would be for Snowden to return to the US on the condition, which he's publicly agreed to, of a trial where he can raise a public interest defense. If convicted at that trial, a pardon might still be considered. This would require an assurance that the espionage act charges be permanently dropped. Hello, users of CMV!

The two trends are that seem to be increasing relentlously are college tuition costs and percentage of people attending college, I blame the system for this, not the individuals, as the U.S. moves further away from manufacturing, the need for college educating people in our work force increases, there are less and less jobs available that don't require college.

PaLM,cmv-237,"Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95% of the population, and I know everyone wants to make college free, but that’s not realistic. So how can we make college more affordable? 1. Start saving early. The sooner you start saving for college, the more time your money has to grow. Even if you can only save a small amount each month, it will add up over time. There are many different ways to save for college, such as 529 plans, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), and UGMA/UTMA accounts. 2. Apply for financial aid. There are many different types of financial aid available, such as scholarships, grants, and loans. Do your research and apply for as much financial aid as you qualify for. 3. Work part-time. If you can, work part-time while you’re in college. This will help you cover your living expenses and make your college savings go further. 4. Choose a college that’s affordable. Don’t just go to the most expensive college you can get into. Do your research and find a college that’s a good fit for you and that you can afford. 5. Live on campus. Living on campus is more expensive than living off campus, but it can also be more convenient. If you can afford it, living on campus will give you access to more resources and support services. 6. Take advantage of scholarships and grants. There are many scholarships and grants available for students who meet certain criteria. Do your research and apply for as many scholarships and grants as you qualify for. 7. Take out student loans. If you need to take out student loans, make sure you understand the terms and conditions before you sign anything. Only borrow what you need and make sure you have a plan to repay the loans. 8. Get a part-time job. If you can, get a part-time job while you’re in college. This will help you cover your living expenses and make your student loan payments go further. 9. Graduate on time. The sooner you graduate, the sooner you can start earning money and repaying your student loans. 10. Get a good job. After you graduate, get a good job and start saving money. This will help you repay your student loans and build your financial future."
OpenAI,cmv-237,"Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make sure that their child has access to quality education, but unfortunately, predicting college tuition 18 years from now is a difficult task as there are various factors that affect tuition rates. Historical trends show that college tuition increases at a rate higher than inflation, with a typical yearly increase of about 3-5. However, this can vary depending on the state and the institution. Another factor to consider is the government's involvement in funding education. Government policies can greatly influence tuition rates, and changes in these policies can cause significant fluctuations in college tuition. In summary, while it is difficult to predict what college tuition will be in 18 years, it is safe to assume that it will continue to rise at a rate higher than inflation. Parents can mitigate the costs by starting to save early and exploring different options for financial aid and scholarships."

Shorter version: How much more money does someone need before it is worth giving them some kind sorta free-market type options?

So, with that said, I think we should at least put it on the table. Do we really need to spend that much money on college tuition? I'm a first generation college student, and I feel like the average tuition for a four year university is ridiculous. So, what are your thoughts on this? pavanky I don't have an answer, but I do know that this is something that needs to be talked about. I don't think college tuition is too high, but I do think there are too many students who get into college that are not necessarily ready for it. The system needs to work better. I also think there are some courses that students shouldn't take, but those are outside the scope of this discussion. billconan this is great! for many of us, it is the only chance to go to college. zheng from the video: tuition is a kind of hidden tax that doesn't show up on your tax return and it's incredibly difficult to pay. and it is incredibly difficult to pay delecti It's also a tax on those that are paying for it. You are paying for the cost of the education, whether you attend or not. You are also paying for the cost of the college's building, maintenance, and operating costs. You are also paying for the cost of the administration, who are there to help and guide you. I think you can agree that it is a tax. dvt I'm not sure why the parent comment is being downvoted. I think this is a great way of thinking about it, and I think it's a pretty good way of framing it. When we talk about tuition, we are often discussing it in isolation. But, the reality is that a college education is a luxury good. The value of the goods is, of course, tied to the labor market. However, the marginal utility of the goods is very high. There are very few places where I can earn a good income with an education in my field. As a result, there are many people that will pay a great deal to attend college, and there are a great deal of people that will pay a great deal to attend a good college. qbrass the marginal utility of the goods is very high This is not true. I can have a car, and I'm pretty sure I'd find it useful to go to the store and have it pick me up some groceries, but it's not the only reason I'd want to own a car. polskibus How can a college student live without netflix? falcolas For many, many of them, it's their primary entertainment. djrogers This is a good video, but I have to disagree with the author's conclusion. I don't think that this is a problem that is specific to education, and I think it's a problem that is a global one. The people that have the power to do something about it are the same people that are profiting from it. The banks, oil companies, and telecoms. I have a better idea: break up the power of the large companies that profit from the market distortion and move the money to the people who actually need it. If you don't have money to pay for college, you don't need it. dragonwriter I don't think that this is a problem that is specific to education, and I think it's a problem that is a global one. Yes, this is a global problem, but it's a particular problem of education. The value of education, and the associated value of a college education, is very strongly correlated with the country of origin of the educational institution. djrogers The value of education is not very strongly correlated with the country of origin of the educational institution.

Eleuther-AI,cmv-238,"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but the right to remove a unit from regulation is granted by its owner after ten years (say) if he or she can find new tenants willingable in at least some acceptable part on Manhattan's market prices; otherwise it remains under protection forevermore (in fact these rules are already vaguely like this). And similarly with stabilized buildings - until they reach their first-year expiration date then each building becomes eligible again as usual when an apartment goes vacant.""

I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but the cap on monthly increases in rents (commonly known as a ""rent freeze is removed. Under rent control an owner's ability to raise their rental rate depends upon whether or not they exceed the amount set by regulations. The regulations are framed so as to ensure a certain number if tenants stay with the property over time. An increase under this system can only happen when there are vacancies available at prices below market rates. This prevents speculators from becoming owners who will then easily sell out real estate developers looking to build new high-rise housing projects elsewhere."

I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but new units should not be put under rent control or stabilization. Instead, policies should be introduced to increase the supply of affordable housing in the city, such as providing incentives for developers to build apartments that are affordable for low and middle-income families. This would help to address the underlying issue of a lack of affordable housing, rather than just applying a band-aid solution by limiting rent on a small number of units. This approach would also encourage housing development in areas where it is needed most, making it easier for individuals and families to find affordable, quality housing in the city."
PaLM,cmv-238,"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but that no new units be brought under control. New units should be subject to the market rate. There are several reasons why rent control and rent stabilization should be abolished. First, they are both inefficient. They distort the market and lead to shortages of affordable housing. Second, they are unfair. They benefit a small number of current tenants at the expense of future tenants and the broader community. Third, they are expensive to administer. The inefficiency of rent control and rent stabilization is well-documented. Studies have shown that rent control leads to a decrease in the supply of housing, an increase in the cost of housing, and a decrease in the quality of housing. This is because rent control makes it more profitable for landlords to keep their units vacant than to rent them out. It also makes it more difficult for landlords to make necessary repairs and improvements. The unfairness of rent control and rent stabilization is also well-documented. Rent control benefits a small number of current tenants at the expense of future tenants and the broader community. Current tenants are able to pay below-market rent for their apartments, while future tenants are forced to pay higher rents. This makes it more difficult for people to afford to live in New York City. The expense of rent control and rent stabilization is also well-documented. The city spends millions of dollars each year administering rent control and rent stabilization programs. This money could be better spent on other programs that would benefit the entire community. There are several alternatives to rent control and rent stabilization that would be more efficient, fair, and less expensive. One alternative is to provide housing subsidies to low-income households. This would allow people to afford to live in New York City without distorting the market or creating shortages of affordable housing. Another alternative is to build more affordable housing. This would increase the supply of affordable housing and make it easier for people to find affordable housing. I urge the city to abolish rent control and rent stabilization. These programs are inefficient, unfair, and expensive. They are a relic of a bygone era, and they have no place in a modern city like New York."
LLAMA,cmv-238,"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, and that units currently subject to rent stabilization should remain subject to it. But new units should not be subject to either scheme. Currently, any unit built before 1974 is subject to rent stabilization; units built after 1973 are not. Rent control is more complicated: if you are the original tenant, and the unit is in a multiple dwelling built before 1947, it is subject to rent control; and in some cases, apartments with one or two units in a building built before 1969 are subject to rent control. The intent of these schemes was to protect tenants from being priced out of their apartments by high rents. But there are a number of problems with them. First, the schemes are not very effective. Landlords have been able to work around the schemes by forcing tenants out in various ways. Second, the schemes inhibit mobility. If you're in a rent-controlled or rent-stabilized unit, you have a powerful incentive to stay there. Third, the schemes limit the supply of new housing. For obvious reasons, no one wants to build new housing that's subject to rent control or rent stabilization. But that means that the housing stock does not increase. Fourth, the schemes benefit a small number of people at the expense of everyone else. The schemes are a form of redistribution. Fifth, the schemes are based on the assumption that high rents are always a bad thing. But in fact, high rents are a sign of high demand, which often reflects the desirability of the neighborhood. It is a good thing that people want to live in New York; it is a good thing that people are willing to pay high rents to do so. Finally, the schemes are a form of price control, which have always been a bad idea. NYC is one of the few places in the country where rent control is still a thing. Let's abolish it, gradually. Bradley Tusk, The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups from Death by Politics The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups from Death by Politics by Bradley Tusk (Portfolio, 2018) is an enjoyable memoir of a political operative's involvement in Silicon Valley. It provides valuable insights into what it takes to get things done in the political realm, and how to apply these insights to the business world. Tusk has had a remarkable career, and his book is lively, entertaining, and informative. It gives a great portrait of the intersection of business and politics. Tusk has an unusual background. He worked for Chuck Schumer, the Governor of Illinois, and Michael Bloomberg, and he managed Bloomberg's successful campaign for a third term. He also worked on Bloomberg's gun control efforts. But in 2010, he decided to leave politics and work for startups. He has had a number of successes in this arena, including his work for FanDuel and Uber. He has also worked for startups in industries like education, insurance, finance, and healthcare. Tusk is a big believer in disruption, and he has a great sense of how to translate the principles of political campaigning into the world of business. His book is full of stories about how he did this, and it contains many valuable lessons. The book is organized in three parts. The first part is about how to get things done in the world of politics, and Tusk's work for Michael Bloomberg. The second part is about how to apply political techniques to business. The third part is about the future of disruption. Tusk is a pragmatist, and he is not averse to employing controversial tactics. He believes in using whatever tactics will work to get a result. Tusk believes in the importance of understanding public opinion. He writes: In politics, we spend a lot of time understanding public opinion. What do voters think about the issue? Which way do they lean? What do they support? What do they oppose? You have to understand the sentiment of the electorate before you can communicate with it. You can't just say what you think; you have to say what people want to hear. Otherwise, you can't get them to vote for you. (30) Tusk believes in the importance of going on the off"
Tsinghua,cmv-238,"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but the rent on new apartments be limited to 25 of the median income. A flat fee of 100 per month would be imposed on all rentals. The idea is to discourage all but the most affluent renters, who can pay that much, and to incentivize landlords to buy existing apartments and convert them to market rate units. That's a lot of landlords to go after, but if they think their rent is going to go down, they'll start doing that, and the market will adjust. The idea is that they'll also have to sell their apartments to someone who can pay the 100 per month fee. If they don't, their apartment would become a market rate one, and the market will adjust. The downside is that this system is expensive. But that's not the main problem. The main problem is that the only people who would have an incentive to rent in NYC would be people who have absolutely no other choice, and they'd be willing to pay very little. In the short run, that's good. In the long run, it's not. That's why it's important to allow all apartments to be market rate. I'd also like to see a proposal to increase the city minimum wage, to 15 an hour. I'm not sure that it's possible to get this done in the short term, but I think that it should be done. It's a very simple idea: if you work for a living, you should be paid at least 15 an hour. The more people who can make 15 an hour, the more affordable housing will be, and the more businesses will be able to pay their employees more, which is a good thing. If you can't make 15 an hour, you should be able to get by on much less. It's also very easy to do: just pay people at least 15 an hour. That's all it takes. It's not complicated. And if we can get it done, it will be a huge win for the city. We'll have a lot more people working, and they'll be able to pay rent, and businesses will be able to pay their employees more, and everyone will win. It's not a radical idea. But we need to do it, and we need to do it now. And, by the way, there's another way to raise the minimum wage. The Fair Minimum Wage Act. I think it's a great idea, but it's not enough. We need to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour, period. If we're going to raise the minimum wage, we should also provide 15 an hour in benefits to every worker, whether or not they have a job. This is an idea I've been pushing for a while, but it hasn't gotten traction. I think it's important to have, and we should get it done. Finally, we need to make the city more friendly to people who want to start businesses. We should expand the number of small business licenses. We should allow business owners to use their apartments as offices, rather than being forced to rent them out. We should lower the business tax. And we should make the city a much more friendly place for people who want to start businesses. In the long run, this will also be a way to increase the amount of affordable housing. If people can start businesses, they'll be able to buy houses and apartments, and that's good for the city. But in the short run, it's a way to help businesses get off the ground, which will make the city a much better place. If you want to be more than just a spectator, you should sign up for a neighborhood watch. There's nothing better for neighborhoods than to have a neighborhood watch. There's nothing better for cities than to have a citizens' group. In New York, there's a Citizens Union, which does all sorts of great things. And there's also a group called the Neighborhood Watch Coalition, which does a lot of great things, including neighborhood watch. I encourage you to join. And if you're not in a neighborhood, or if you're not a citizen, you can join the Citizens Union. We're a very diverse group. We're democrats and republicans, liberals and conservatives, socialists and anarchists, all sorts of different people. And we're here to do our part to make New York a better place."
Human,cmv-238,"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but that: Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant. If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates. Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely. Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls. Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5 per year. Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market. This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land. Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis. The reason I want to abolish rent regulations in NYC is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city. Anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city. It also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units. I don't think there should be a property right in a rental. If you want a property interest in the place where you live, you should buy it. If you're renting, you should be subject to the market forces that come with that. Edit 1: I was hoping to get some replies before I had to step away, but so far it's just crickets. Will be away from computer for about an hour and a half or so, and will reply when I'm back. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I believe that some of the most important things to consider when developing a UX strategy are:  User research. This is the foundation of any good UX strategy. It's essential to understand your users' needs, pain points, and goals in order to create a product that meets their needs. There are a number of different ways to conduct user research, such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing.  Design. The design of your product is critical to its success. It needs to be both visually appealing and functional. The design should also be consistent with your brand identity.  Content. The content on your product should be relevant, informative, and engaging. It should also be written in a clear and concise manner.  Usability. Your product needs to be easy to use. Users should be able to find what they're looking for quickly and easily. The navigation should be clear and intuitive, and the buttons and links should be easy to click.  Accessibility. Your product should be accessible to users with disabilities. This means that it should be possible to use the product with a keyboard, mouse, or other assistive device.  Performance. Your product needs to be fast and responsive. Users should not have to wait long for pages to load or for actions to be completed.  Security. Your product needs to be secure. Users need to be confident that their data is safe.  Customer support. You need to provide your users with good customer support. This means being available to answer questions, resolve issues, and provide feedback. By following these principles, you can create a UX strategy that will help you create a successful product."
Tsinghua,cmv-239,"This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the big problems with the Republican party are stemming from the fact that there is a lack of accountability within the party, which has allowed for big corporations to buy the Republican party, and a lack of independence in the GOP, which allows for it to become more of a corporation than a party. A 501 (c) (3) organization is allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money from the general public, and can donate as much as they want. A 501 (c) (4) organization, like the Republican party, is not allowed to accept unlimited donations, and is limited to raising funds from only ""qualified"" donors. While the Republican party is only allowed to raise 3.5 million a year from individuals, corporations are allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to 501 (c) (4) organizations. The Republican party's corporate donations are completely legal, and are used to buy off the GOP establishment, giving them the ability to elect pro-corporate candidates that support big business interests. Candidates who are part of the GOP establishment are likely to have no political experience, or very little, if any. They have been groomed by the party's corporate backers to carry out the wishes of big business. The Republican party's lack of independence has allowed for the party to become a 501 (c) (4) organization, which in turn allows for it to be bought by corporations. This is in contrast to the Democrats, who have a very long history of being independent and standing up for the working class. Many of the biggest political donors in the Democratic party are unions, which are generally comprised of members who work for corporations, and many unions have historically been critical of the Republican party, and have stood up to big business in the past. The Democratic party's independence from big business has allowed for it to gain traction among working class voters, and has allowed for it to stand up to big business. This is very different than the Republican party, which has allowed for big business to buy it. If big business is able to buy the Republican party, and has the ability to control the party, then big business is able to push through legislation that will benefit corporations at the expense of working class voters. The lack of independence from big business is also allowing for a lack of accountability within the Republican party. The corporate donors that are giving money to the Republican party are not held accountable by the party, and are able to control the party with the help of the party's establishment. The Republican party is not going to be held accountable by the American people for the actions that are being taken within the party, and this is why big business can buy the Republican party, and push through legislation that will benefit big business at the expense of working class voters."
LLAMA,cmv-239,"This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the issues we are having in America in regards to violence are due to the fact that we are not allowed to deal with our feelings in a healthy way. Most of us are walking around with a lot of emotional baggage and we are unable to process it in a healthy way. Most people don't know how to deal with their emotions, so they bury them and then one day it blows up in their face and they have an emotional outburst. Or they use drugs and alcohol to numb the pain. There are also people who deal with their emotions through violence. There are people who believe that the way to solve problems is to blow them up. This is an ideology that has been bred into people. There is an idea that in order to deal with a problem, you have to destroy it, either literally or figuratively. This is an ideology that is coming from our political leaders and trickling down into the people. The idea that ""I don't like you, so I will destroy you."" This is happening all the time in our country, and people are watching. Children are constantly watching us. They mimic everything we do. They are like little sponges, absorbing everything around them and storing it in their minds for later use. The way we react to things will be the way they react to things. If we teach children that violence is the answer, then when they grow up they will be violent people. We can not expect people to act in a civil manner if we are not acting in a civil manner ourselves. This is why I believe that the healing of our country starts with the healing of the individual. We must heal ourselves and then we can heal the collective consciousness. We must teach people to deal with their emotions in a healthy way. We must teach people that violence is not the answer. We must teach children that we can overcome our issues in a healthy way without violence. We must teach children that they don't have to be like us, that they can be better than us. We must teach children that they can heal the world. How do we heal ourselves? We need to find our true passions in life. We need to find out what makes us happy and then we must do it! We need to be in touch with ourselves and with the world around us. We need to take a step back and breathe. We need to stop and appreciate the beauty of life. We need to appreciate all of the small things that happen in life that make it worth living. We need to find peace within ourselves. We need to find a spiritual connection to the universe. We need to focus our thoughts on the positive aspects of life and on love. We need to focus our thoughts on gratitude and appreciation. We need to forgive and to let go of anger and resentment. We need to stop judging each other and instead love each other. We need to love ourselves. We need to take care of ourselves. We need to take care of our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. We need to be mindful of what we put into our bodies. We need to focus on healthy foods that will help nourish our bodies and our spirits. We need to be aware of what we are taking in through our minds. We need to find healthy, positive sources of information. We need to limit our exposure to violence and hate. We need to take care of our spirits by spending time in nature, by meditating, and by surrounding ourselves with positivity. We need to find the things in life that make us happy and then we need to do them. We need to exercise, to get outside, to spend time with people we love, and to do what we are passionate about. We need to be the change that we wish to see in the world. We need to heal ourselves. We need to find peace within. We need to find love within. We need to find gratitude within. We need to find passion within. We need to find balance within. We must heal ourselves. Labels: balance, consciousness, emotional, heal, healing, peace, violence Gina Marie November 2, 2013 at 11:53 AM I totally agree with you. We have lost touch with our emotions and have become numb to the violence around us. We have lost sight of what is really important in life. The answers to our problems are not going to be found in violence and destruction. We must learn to love and to find peace within ourselves."

Living off a free welfare check sometimes decreases an individual's drive to work and better themselves; and by extension to increase their standard of living 2. Providing job training andor an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the individual - increasing ambition, social ability, financial stability, and other benefits 3. Providing job training andor an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the society - increasing the education of American society as a whole, decreasing unemployment and crime rates 4.

And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at their hands or fingers while doing so! In this video tutorial I'll show you my 2 favorite typing methods and explain why they work better than traditional ""look down"" finger placement on QWERTY keyboards (and even Dvorak). The first method is called Touch Typing - which just involves placing your fingertips correctly as if playing piano with both thumbs stretched out horizontally across each octave key space starting from middle C all up through G for example... then moving onto second position where only 1 thumb per hand still strokes A-G keys like before except Bb1 Eb2 are substituted by indexmiddle fingernails rather using less radius movement vertically over these notes instead; likewise we repeat same pattern again but use our ring fingertnail pinky tip when hitting Asus4As etc.; finally once everything has been practiced well enough one should be able quickly shift between different chords based upon what needed tone (i) level may require because imajor ii minor iii. iv. vvi.diminished viio minor 3rdvii7 etc.; either way having random chord selection gives extra benefits since some music can actually make more sense played differently according frequency levels involved during composition periods: ie major vs diminished moments within single piece compositions don't mix together very often therefore never need trained memory recall processes necessary due visual confusion created otherwise resulting mainly via incorrect note values being hit manually directly into mechanical action causing failure after many repetitions until proper technique will become ingrained.... also there seems evidence suggesting musical proficiency does seem connected somehow closely attached genetically inheritable traits allowing percussive artists born those who had good hearing ability musically were far likelier developing strong fine motor skills eventually becoming great typists regardless age not much difference anyway however comparing beginning learners vision impaired versus sighted kids might indicate possibly greater likelihood towards poor quality outcomes resultantly slow progress:although perhaps self learning techniques such games involving memorization could help trigger correct neural pathways faster thus producing stronger results..but yes least likely anyone ever acquiring perfect touch control abilities would probably endup decieving themselves sooner though forget about trying too hard,what most do wrong usually already cant look back later unless someone else helps them remember! haha jk:) lol ok maybe thats an exaggeration..not really sure myself...lol"

LLAMA,cmv-240,"I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys. I'm not talking about just blind people, but sighted people, too. Everyone should learn to type without looking at the keyboard, and here's why. 1. You'll work faster. I can type 100 words per minute without looking at the keys. That means I can get more work done in less time, and that's always good. 2. You'll make fewer mistakes. I don't know how many times I've seen a sighted person type something like ""their"" when they meant ""they're."" A lot of that is due to the fact that they don't know where all the keys are and can't spell well, so they just type what they think is right. 3. You'll look more professional. If you can touch type, you'll look like a person who knows what they're doing. You'll look like a professional. I can't tell you how many times I've been at a computer with a sighted person, and they'll ask me to type for them. They don't know how to type, so they depend on someone else to type for them. And yet they're the ones who have sight. Doesn't that seem backwards to you? 4. You'll be more independent. If you can touch type, you won't need someone else to type for you. You'll be able to do it yourself. You won't need to rely on someone else to get something done. 5. You'll be better able to help yourself. I can't tell you how many times I've been in the library, and a sighted person has asked me to help them use a computer. I don't mind helping them, but if they would learn how to type, they wouldn't need my help. 6. You'll be able to do more. If you can touch type, you can do more. You can search the Internet, create documents, and write code. Without the ability to type, you can't do those things. 7. You'll be better able to help others. Once you learn how to type, you'll be able to help others learn to type. You'll be able to help people who can't type. 8. You'll be more mobile. If you can touch type, you can type on your phone. This means that you'll be able to type anywhere you go, whether it's in a car, on a bus, or at a restaurant. You won't need to take your computer with you everywhere you go. 9. You'll be a better writer. If you can touch type, you can type your thoughts as fast as you think them. This means that you can write faster, and your writing will be better. 10. You'll be better at coding. If you can touch type, you can code faster and better. You'll be able to learn new languages more quickly. 11. You'll be a better programmer. If you can touch type, you can program faster. You can code faster, so you can get more work done in less time. You'll be a better programmer. 12. You'll be able to help the world. If you can touch type, you can help the world. You can develop software to help people, and you can make the world a better place. If you can't touch type, you should learn how. That's my advice to all you sighted people out there. If you can touch type, you can do more and help more. Don't you want to do that? Labels: accessibility, keyboarding"

PaLM,cmv-240,"I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys. This is a huge disadvantage, as it can slow you down and make you more prone to errors. If you want to become a faster and more accurate typist, it's essential to learn how to touch type. Touch typing is a technique that allows you to type without looking at the keyboard. This is done by associating each letter with a specific finger. Once you have mastered this technique, you will be able to type much faster and more accurately, even if you are not looking at the keyboard. There are a number of different ways to learn touch typing. You can take a class, use a software program, or simply practice on your own. If you are taking a class or using a software program, you will be given a set of exercises to help you learn the proper finger positions and techniques. You will also be given a list of common words and phrases to practice typing. If you are practicing on your own, there are a number of resources available to help you. You can find websites and apps that offer touch typing lessons, and you can also find books and videos on the subject. Once you have learned the basics of touch typing, you can practice by typing articles, emails, and other documents. The more you practice, the faster and more accurate you will become at touch typing. It may take some time to master this skill, but it is well worth the effort. Touch typing will make you a more efficient and productive typist, and it will also help you to avoid errors. Here are some tips for learning touch typing:  Start by learning the proper finger positions. Each finger should be assigned to a specific group of keys. For example, your index finger should be assigned to the ""F"" and ""J"" keys.  Practice typing common words and phrases. This will help you to learn the muscle memory needed for touch typing.  Use a timer to track your progress. This will help you to see how quickly you are improving.  Don't be discouraged if you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new skill. Just keep practicing and you will eventually get better. Touch typing is a valuable skill that can benefit you in both your personal and professional life. By taking the time to learn this skill, you can improve your typing speed and accuracy, and you can also reduce the risk of making errors. Here are some additional resources that you may find helpful:  [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/) is a free online typing tutor that offers a variety of lessons and exercises.  [Keybr](https://keybr.com/) is another free online typing tutor that uses a unique algorithm to help you learn touch typing.  [TypeRacer](https://www.typeracer.com/) is a fun online typing game that can help you improve your speed and accuracy.

Human,cmv-240,"I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent. Some points that I use to support this argument: 1. Faster typing more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. 2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you. 3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. So, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. Why university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. Am I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. Edit 1 Well, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. The argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill. For those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing. And for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type. Edit 2, View Changed ucheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. Thanks for all the posts and cordial discussion. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The Homo sapiens component of Earth's metabolism is also constantly changing and evolving. The human population has grown exponentially over the past few centuries, and this growth has had a significant impact on Earth's systems. Humans have altered the landscape, introduced new species, and changed the climate. These changes have had both positive and negative consequences for humans and other species. On the one hand, human ingenuity and technological progress have led to advances in medicine, agriculture, and transportation that have improved the quality of life for many people. On the other hand, human activities have also contributed to environmental problems such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change. The future of Earth's metabolism is uncertain. If humans continue to consume resources at the current rate, we will likely face serious environmental problems. However, if we can make changes to our lifestyles and technologies, we can help to create a more sustainable future for both humans and other species. In order to create a more sustainable future, we need to make changes to the way we live and work. We need to reduce our consumption of resources, find more sustainable ways to produce energy, and protect the environment. We also need to work together to find solutions to global problems such as climate change and poverty.

Conserve water: By using water efficiently and reducing water pollution, we can help maintain the balance of the water cycle. Simple actions such as turning off the tap while brushing teeth or using a low-flow showerhead can make a big difference. 2. Reduce carbon emissions: The burning of fossil fuels has increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, leading to climate change. By reducing our carbon footprint through actions such as reducing car use, using renewable energy and eating a plant-based diet, we can help restore balance to the carbon cycle. 3. Support biodiversity: All the different species on Earth are interconnected and rely on each other for survival. By preserving biodiversity and protecting animal habitats, we can support the nutrient cycles that sustain life. 4. Reduce waste: Waste contributes to pollution and depletes resources, disrupting nutrient cycles. By reducing, reusing, and recycling, we can reduce the amount of waste we produce and keep resources in circulation.

Maybe there wasn't any significant adaptation since then but just ongoing genetic drift from established original traits due only partly natural selection pressures?.

Of course I'm speaking here merely about what can actually happen naturally rather not trying anything like breeding programs designed solely toward evolving newer living beings through artificial means eventually resulting illogically into virtual monsters nobody wants!. Evolutionary processes don't work according Hollywood scriptures!!! Still if you want yet another testament look no further back before 1950 AD fewer major wars occurred between different ethnic groups worldwide until WWII broke out although sporadic conflicts still existed prior simply among smaller numbers under less organized conditions..Nowadays whole countries go off war footing whenever fighting occurs anywhere - especially UDAM vs NLDM type situations....That doesn' t seem 'natural'. Instead your best bet might postulate other causes associated mainly linked somehow related social media.. upsetting world peace has become almost viral phenomenon..."
Tsinghua,cmv-241,"The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of this metabolic cycle is also a cycle and part of the total system. But it is not the only cycle. So how do we come to understand this system? The Earth's biosphere and the solar system are big. It's not easy to understand all the interactions. So, we have to focus on a few key components. Plants, animals, and humans are key components. We need to understand these key components. We also need to understand how these key components are connected to each other and to the whole. How do we do that? Well, we use some of the same techniques that we used in physics. We ask questions and we look for answers. We study things that can be measured. We use math to make the calculations. We do the math and the calculations and we use the answers to make a model. We compare the model to the reality and see how well it fits. We then improve the model and compare it to reality again. And again. And again. We do this over and over and over. And in the end, we have a pretty good understanding of the Earth's biosphere and solar system. We have a pretty good understanding of how the Earth works. We have a pretty good understanding of how plants and animals and humans interact with each other and with the Earth.

Human,cmv-242,"Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure] , [poverty rates] , [education] , and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. This leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts: Land Size Population Cultural Heterogeneity First, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest: Russia Canada China United States Brazil The US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. Now here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest: China India United States Indonesia Brazil Not only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America wisely spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. The only other country that hangs with America in both categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point a heterogeneous culture. The US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits every child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education should produce high results. And yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index] as late as 2014. So, basically my argument is this The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered.

Tsinghua,cmv-242,"Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in education. Many people, myself included, believe that the lack of commitment to teaching in this country is a major factor. I have seen this lack of commitment in the classroom and in my personal life. I have seen teachers not caring enough about their students to give them the best education possible. I have also seen parents not wanting their children to be exposed to learning that is not just a necessary skill but also an enjoyment. I believe that the only way to fix this problem is to get parents and teachers to understand that the classroom is not just a place to pass a test and that learning is an integral part of a child's life. This idea is furthered by the fact that the United States has the second highest amount of children living in poverty. I have no doubt that the majority of these children would benefit greatly from a good education. So, I have come up with a solution to help combat this problem. I would like to create a non-profit organization to help children learn to be happy and enjoy learning. I would also like to raise awareness of the importance of education and the problems that face children in poverty. In my opinion, the best way to do this is to create an education for kids foundation. I would like to see the foundation teach kids that education is fun, and that learning is a lifelong pursuit. This foundation would also give them a chance to work with others in the community and get involved with activities and organizations that are important to them. I believe that this foundation would have a positive impact on these children and would help them have a brighter future. I would like to hear your thoughts and ideas on how to create a foundation like this. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Thank you.

I am writing to you today to ask you for your support and help. As you know, the United States is facing a budget crisis that threatens to hurt many people. The budget crisis has been created by our government, but the impact will be felt by many people, especially by the elderly, the poor, and the disabled. In Florida, our budget crisis is made worse by a number of factors, one of which is a growing budget deficit. Florida faces a deficit of 2.4 billion in the upcoming budget year. As a result, we have cut many services and have decreased the number of public employees. I want to change this. I am working on a campaign to increase funding for public education and to reduce the budget deficit in Florida. As you may know, public education is the cornerstone of any society and is very important. The United States has a poor ranking in education and I want to change this. I want to make sure that Florida is investing in education and making sure that all of our children receive a good education. I am asking for your support in this campaign. I want to get you involved. I want to involve you in helping me change the state of Florida. If you would like to join me in this effort, please fill out the following form. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, s andrew mccoll Monday, January 28, 2012 Dear Friends, Greetings, As you may know, we are facing a serious budget crisis.

PaLM,cmv-242,"Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in education, healthcare, and other important metrics. While some argue that these reports are overblown and that the US is still a great place to live, I believe that they raise some serious concerns about the future of our country. In this post, I will argue that the US is falling behind other developed countries in a number of important areas, and that this is a problem that needs to be addressed. I will focus on three specific areas: education, healthcare, and economic inequality. Education The US has long been considered a world leader in education, but our standing has been slipping in recent years. According to the latest PISA study, American students ranked 38th out of 79 countries in math and 24th in reading. This is a significant decline from previous years, and it is a cause for concern. There are a number of reasons why the US is falling behind in education. One reason is that we spend less on education than most other developed countries. In 2017, the US spent an average of $12,617 per student, compared to $16,075 in Canada and $18,383 in Germany. This lack of funding has led to larger class sizes, fewer resources for teachers, and a lower quality of education overall. Another reason for the decline in American education is the fact that we have a more diverse student population than most other countries. This diversity can be a strength, but it also presents challenges. Teachers need to be trained to meet the needs of students from all backgrounds, and schools need to provide resources that are culturally relevant. The US also has a problem with standardized testing. These tests are used to measure student achievement, but they can also be used to punish schools that are not doing well. This can lead to a narrowing of the curriculum and a focus on test preparation at the expense of learning. The decline in American education is a serious problem. It is a problem that is holding our country back and making it more difficult for us to compete in the global economy. We need to make changes to our education system if we want to ensure that our children have the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. Healthcare The US healthcare system is also in need of reform. The system is expensive, inefficient, and inequitable. According to the World Health Organization, the US spends more on healthcare than any other country in the world, but we have worse health outcomes than many other developed countries. There are a number of reasons why the US healthcare system is so expensive. One reason is that we have a fragmented system with multiple payers. This makes it difficult to coordinate care and control costs. Another reason is that we have a high rate of medical malpractice lawsuits. This drives up the cost of insurance and makes it more difficult for doctors to practice medicine. The US healthcare system is also inefficient. There is a lot of waste and duplication of services. We also have a long wait time for care, and many people are unable to afford the care they need. The US healthcare system is also inequitable. People who are poor or uninsured are less likely to have access to quality care. This leads to worse health outcomes for these individuals and their families. The US healthcare system is in need of major reform. We need to make changes to the way we pay for healthcare, the way we deliver healthcare, and the way we regulate healthcare. We need to make sure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare. Economic Inequality Income inequality is also a major problem in the US. The gap between the rich and the poor has been growing wider for decades, and this is having a negative impact on our economy and our society. According to the Pew Research Center, the top 1% of earners in the US take home more than 20% of the nation's income. This is more than double the share they took home in the 1970s. The bottom 50% of earners, on the other hand, take home less than 13% of the nation's income. This is down from 18% in the 1970s. Income inequality is a problem because it has a number of negative consequences. It leads to lower economic growth, more poverty, and more social unrest. It also makes it harder for people to move up the economic ladder. The US needs to address the problem of income inequality. We need to make sure that everyone has a fair shot at success. We need to make sure that our economy is working for everyone, not just the wealthy few. The US is falling behind other developed countries in a"
BigScience,cmv-242,"Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in one particular achievement: science. The research has shown us we are lagging behind other countries on average by seven years as it comes to innovating new technologies. The good news is we've begun to act. We've signed an agreement with China to push for joint scientific research projects such as space exploration (space flights) and climate change. Our investment in RD continues to be at least three times higher than anyone else's (I was happy to hear President Obama just proposed increasing this figure). We also continue our efforts to encourage young talented women into STEM fields. However, I think there's something missing from all these statements; why do people need advice? Why should they follow someone like me who doesn't care about politics or anything? I'm not saying that I want everyone to directly ""choose"" what they study based solely off of their own desires andor abilities. In my day job, I am heavily involved with hiring college students for internships within the corporate environment. My main point here though is: how can government take over one's educational career path? For example, Obama cited that he would focus more on science education rather than liberal arts. However, if I wanted to pursue philosophy, where would I find funding through grants? (For those asking question regarding programs offered through colleges - I believe only undergraduate degrees are funded by the federal government.) Why does school represent so much pressure, especially when society itself seems disinterested in its future? A: If you're going to ask that kind of questions then it's because you've already made up your mind. As far as I remember, public schools were founded to give free education to children whose parents didn't earn enough money to pay private teachers. And after World War II most governments decided that public education had to get better. There isn't really any way around it: If you want your child to work in some industry that specializes on making computers, you'll have to send them to a high-tech factory near Silicon Valley. And maybe they'll stay there 10-20 years until they're ready to go back home again if there aren't opportunities outside the USA. There's no guarantee they'll ever make it back to Europe. But it may mean less stressful life. Please keep in mind that school is supposedly meant to teach kids skills useful later in life, but that's not always true. A lot of great scientists was taught very poorly at school. (Georges Charpak was actually taught algebra at 5!!!) So sometimes education can be too theoretical and boring which makes learning difficult. Even worse, it might lead to intellectual laziness since any student knows that copying somebody else is easier than thinking. (That's even part of being famous; Another problem is social isolation. Researchers normally come from big cities. They usually don't mix well with locals, either because they are foreigners or because they can't speak English properly. (See another answer for the link between poverty and academic performance.) This causes problems during long term stays abroad. On the other hand, living in rural area definitely helps to gain independence. Nowadays, many countries offer post-secondary education without requiring to attend a university or paying tuition fees. Because of globalisation, employers prefer candidates with international experience. So in addition to getting information independent of your family, you still will probably end up working somewhere that offers interesting work. A: I'm sure that politicians love hearing things like: ""We've got you covered! Your kid needs training in certain subjectareastage right now! Get herhim out there!"" Of course, given the nature of political officevery short tenureand especially considering the record length of time required to pass legislation, and the fact that Congress members tend to disagree with each others' ideas and proposals before passing laws themselves, it wouldn't surprise me if we're talking several decades away in terms of accomplishing something significant. Given current trends, I'd say we're still 20-30 years away from large scale implementation of robotics-driven healthcare treatment centers, social robots able to meet human needs, etc.,etc.."
OpenAI,cmv-242,"Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in terms of healthcare outcomes, despite spending more per capita on healthcare than any other country in the world. While the reasons for this are multifaceted, I believe that one key factor is the lack of a comprehensive and universal healthcare system in the US. Opponents of universal healthcare often argue that it would be too expensive and that it would limit individuals' freedom to choose their own healthcare options. However, I believe that these arguments are misguided. First, while implementing a universal healthcare system would require a significant initial investment, studies have shown that it would actually save money in the long run due to increased efficiency and a focus on preventative care. Secondly, having a universal healthcare system would actually increase individuals' freedom and autonomy by relieving the burden of healthcare costs and allowing people to choose the healthcare options that are best suited to their needs, rather than being limited by what they can afford. Overall, I believe that the implementation of a universal healthcare system in the US would result in better healthcare outcomes for all, increased individual freedom and autonomy, and cost savings in the long run."
LLAMA,cmv-242,"Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in the field of mathematics. While many of these studies are a bit controversial, I think that there is at least some consensus that we could be doing better. One of the more recent studies on the subject, produced by the US Department of Education in 2010, reported that: In 2003, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (NMAP) was convened to address concerns about student achievement in mathematics. NMAP was charged with identifying the skills and knowledge students need to learn mathematics, recommending improvements in the teaching of mathematics, and recommending improvements in the assessment of students' mathematics knowledge. In its March 2008 report, NMAP concluded that the system for teaching and learning mathematics in the United States is not well designed and that it fails to meet the needs of many students. This report goes on to describe how the teaching of mathematics in the United States is lacking in focus, coherence, and rigor. In an effort to address this issue, NMAP recommends that Mathematics should be taught by teachers who have strong mathematical knowledge and who understand how to teach the subject to students. There should be more depth, not more breadth, in mathematics instruction. There should be more focus on core topics. Teachers should be well prepared to teach mathematical content and cognitive strategies. Teachers should be well prepared to teach students who struggle with mathematics. The teaching of mathematics should be organized around important mathematical topics and coherent concepts. There should be a balance between students' procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. Instruction should include immediate corrective feedback. The report also mentions that there is a lack of teachers who are qualified to teach mathematics. In a study produced by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018), it was reported that: The good news is that the United States is not alone in facing challenges in mathematics education. But the bad news is that the United States ranks near the bottom among countries participating in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). In addition, the United States has a high school graduation rate of 83 percent - the highest of any industrialized nation - but ranks 38th out of 71 countries in mathematics achievement, as measured by PISA. The authors of the study conclude that the current mathematics education system in the United States is not producing graduates who are ready to pursue STEM-related careers. They also report that mathematics-related careers are the fastest growing in the country and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that these careers will continue to grow at a rate of 28 percent through 2020. The authors make a number of recommendations regarding ways to improve the current education system. In regards to the need for better mathematics teachers, they state that The nation needs to establish the infrastructure, policies, and support necessary for ensuring a strong, well-prepared mathematics teacher in every classroom. As part of this effort, they recommend that The profession must increase the capacity of teacher preparation programs to prepare teachers who have the content knowledge, and the commitment to equity and access, to support the mathematics learning of all students. Following these recommendations, the authors propose a number of specific actions that can be taken to help improve the mathematics education system in the United States. With all this in mind, I'm curious to know if anyone else has noticed these issues and if you have any thoughts about how we, as a community, can address them. I'd love to hear any ideas andor experiences that you might have! egingroup Math and science are all about discovery. The current math education system is designed around transmission. So while there are a few high-scoring students who can succeed in that environment, the average student becomes bored, loses motivation, and struggles to understand. When they're struggling they go slower, so they get more and more behind, so they fall farther and farther behind. It's all self-reinforcing. The whole system needs to be overhauled, but I don't think it will be until it becomes a political issue. endgroup - Rick Decker Jan 23 at 3:22 egingroup RickDecker Thank you for your input! While it is true that we have been testing students for a long time, I don't think that testing in itself is inherently bad. However, I think that we can do a much better"
PaLM,cmv-243,"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However, I would argue that education is more important than medicine for several reasons. Education is the foundation of a society. It is how we learn about the world around us and how we develop the skills we need to succeed in life. A well-educated population is essential for a healthy democracy. It allows people to make informed decisions about their lives and their government. It also helps to promote social mobility and economic growth. Medicine, on the other hand, is important but it is not as essential as education. People can survive without medical care, but they cannot survive without education. Education is what allows us to live in a civilized society. There are a number of reasons why education is more important than medicine. First, education is more universal than medicine. Everyone needs education, but not everyone needs medical care. Second, education has a longer-term impact than medicine. The benefits of education last a lifetime, while the benefits of medical care are often temporary. Third, education is more equitable than medicine. Everyone has access to education, but not everyone has access to medical care. Of course, medicine is still important. It saves lives and improves the quality of life for many people. But education is more important because it is the foundation of a healthy society. Here are some specific examples of how education is more important than medicine:  Education helps people to get better jobs. A study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that people with a college degree earn more money than people with only a high school diploma.  Education helps people to live longer and healthier lives. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that people who are educated are more likely to exercise, eat healthy foods, and get regular checkups. They are also less likely to smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.  Education helps people to be more involved in their communities. A study by the University of Michigan found that people who are educated are more likely to vote, volunteer, and participate in other civic activities. These are just a few examples of how education is more important than medicine. Education is the foundation of a healthy society and it is essential for a better world."
Eleuther-AI,cmv-243,"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I would like to think there is some leveling off in this regard because for example universities have become extremely competitive so they're no longer equalizers but rather filterers - students with greater resources will be more successful than others though perhaps not as much success or experience (education) can still create equality if it were free at point A from place B although even then we're talking about very poor regions compared here). Note: ""If you want an applesoranges comparison"" means comparing one thing directly against another without accounting too deeply into their inherent nature i e apple vs orange juice...I agree completely on your points regarding medicine which does seem less socialist since doctors make money selling health care through insurance companies via fees etc., thus creating rich physicians while training them up requires school loans paid back years later under unequal terms depending upon access time constraints....maybe thats just my perspective?"
LLAMA,cmv-243,"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I am more familiar with the education system. On the other hand, I don't know much about medicine, but I have read, in some of the posts on this board, that many docs don't like the present system and that there are many problems in the medicine. Now I have a question. What would be the result if we privatize medicine the way we privatized education? I think we need to change the way we educate and the way we deliver healthcare. These are two major components of a social system. I don't think any society can be successful unless we improve them. Our healthcare and education systems are not only important for the individual, they are also important for the nation. I think the only reason the medical system is the way it is today is because of the AMA. The AMA is made up of a bunch of wealthy docs who are rich enough to pay off the politicians to keep the high costs of medical care where they are. The AMA also acts as a price fixing organization by dictating what prices the hospitals and doctors can charge. IMO, they are a bunch of thieves. I'm not too sure about that. I have heard that the AMA actually represents a fairly small percentage of practicing doctors (I don't know the stats). A lot of what goes on in the US is due to the desire of the people for the best care possible, coupled with a desire to pay little to nothing for it. This is the result of our governments' unwillingness to tell us that we can't have what we want. I think that people here are perfectly happy to pay the astronomical fees to see a specialist, but I know that most of them would be outraged if the government told them that they had to pay for their own care and it wasn't going to be covered by insurance. There is no easy answer. I know that there are a lot of things that could be done to lower costs (like eliminating the bureaucracy in the healthcare system) and it would probably make things much more affordable. But until the people accept the fact that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that good healthcare will cost them something, it will be a tough fight to change things. i agree that we need to change the way we educate and the way we deliver healthcare. i think the change needs to be in the direction of privatization and less government control. what we have now is a government controlled system that has become incredibly expensive and inefficient. The AMA is a lobbying group, and they do their best to get a return for their members' dues. The AMA does not represent all of the physicians in the US. A large percentage of doctors do not belong to the AMA. The AMA does not have a monopoly on medical care. They do not set prices, they do not have a monopoly on health care, and they do not have a lock on employment in the health care industry. The AMA does not prevent non-members from entering the medical profession. There is no ""AMA test"" that you must pass to be allowed to practice medicine. The AMA is no more or less evil than the NEA. As a physician, the only thing the AMA does for me is give me a magazine and a journal. And they charge me 400 a year for the privilege. I'm glad I quit them a long time ago. I think it's a bit more complex than that. Certainly, though, the AMA has no interest in seeing the government get involved in health care. They are a lobbying group after all. Yes, there are thousands of physicians in the U.S. who are not members of the AMA. The AMA does not ""control"" or even represent a majority of physicians. The AMA does not determine what specialists get paid. They do not determine how much your local family practice MD will charge for a visit. I can only speak to my situation, but I'm happy to be able to pick and choose where I work, who I work for, and what I charge for my services. The AMA does not prevent non-members from entering the medical profession. There is no ""AMA test"" that you must pass to be allowed to practice medicine. The AMA is no more or less evil than the NEA. The AMA is a private organization with no governmental power."

Tsinghua,cmv-243,"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe they can be re-integrated into a social system. Medicine: It should be made mandatory for all citizens to be in good health and to have basic healthcare. Education: It should be made mandatory for all citizens to have a basic education, and the right to a higher education, free of charge, with scholarships for poor students. Both of these policies would be extremely cost-effective, as well as reducing the burden of health care and education costs. Additionally, it would help the poorest citizens and make everyone better off. It would reduce the incentive to cheat on exams, cheat on tests, or take a low-paying job, and it would be a better use of their time and money. In addition, it would give everyone a more basic understanding of the world and society, and would enable more people to learn from each other. This will increase social interaction, which is an extremely beneficial social and economic activity. To help encourage these policies, the government could have vouchers for healthcare and education. I propose that each citizen receive a fixed amount of vouchers per year. For example, a 25-year-old would receive 2000 per year. The government would give these vouchers to hospitals and universities, so that everyone would be able to use them. I also believe that the vouchers should be used for education and healthcare, not for other purposes. If the government wanted to give more money to certain citizens, they could use the money to fund a certain scholarship. For example, the government could fund a scholarship for students who study computer science. However, the government would not give these scholarships to people who study economics or law, as it would interfere with the ability of these people to get a job. A related proposal is that if a person who studies computer science or math has a job, then they should receive the full amount of the scholarship. The reason why is that they would be able to pay the government back if they do not find a job. The government would need to encourage people to go to school, as they are the ones who pay for it. If they did not go to school, then the government would not be able to get the full amount of money that they would have gotten if they had gone to school. The government could also give incentives to students to go to school. For example, if a student graduates from college with a certain amount of money, then the student would receive a percentage of that money, as a reward. However, I believe that this percentage should be set by the government. For example, a 25-year-old who graduated with 10,000 should receive 2000. The reason why is that if the student has money to get an education, then they should be rewarded. Furthermore, the government would need to keep track of who goes to school and who does not. If someone does not go to school, they should not be able to receive a certain amount of money. For example, if someone does not go to school, they should not be able to receive the full amount of money that they would have received if they had gone to school. If the person does not have a job, they should not be able to receive the full amount of money that they would have received if they had gone to school. If the person has a job, but does not go to school, then they should receive a smaller amount of money. However, the amount of money should be lower than the amount of money that they would have received if they had gone to school. For example, if a person goes to school, but does not have a job, then they should receive the full amount of money that they would have received if they had gone to school. This is a very simple proposal. It would not only help to get more people into school, but it would also make people better off. Furthermore, it would not cost much, as it would only cost the government to give the vouchers to schools. I think that it would be a very effective policy. However, I believe that it would not be a good policy if the government did not give vouchers to schools. A proposal for education is to give vouchers to schools. The government would give these vouchers to schools. This would help everyone, as it would help everyone pay for education. If someone has money, then they would be able to pay for their education, and if someone does not have money, then they would be able to pay for their education. Furthermore, the vouchers would be given to all schools, and not just certain schools. If a school has a good reputation, then they should be able to use the vouchers. If a school has a bad reputation, then they should not be able to use the vouchers."
Human,cmv-243,"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe they should be free for several reasons: - One's health is essentially a genetic lottery. You shouldn't be punished because you were unlucky enough to develop cancer or be born with a blood disease - Health can be a direct result of economic conditions and people should not be punished because of the quality and quantity of food their parent (s) provide. - Education is essentially an economic lottery. If you don't have enough money to pay for college, good luck. Many people are only able to take out student loans because of a cosigner (or their parents outright pay it). Parent's don't have the credit? Your shit out of luck. - Education is the foundation for the future of society. Forget job opportunities for now, higher education provides valuable skills that cannot be learned anywhere else. By not providing equal opportunities, we are decreasing the intelligence of the population. - By educating the population, especially the poor, we will decrease crime as well. As of now, many poor kids know they'll never go to college even before they reach high school. By giving equal opportunity, kids will have incentive to stay in school and stay out of trouble. At least they can go to college. - By not providing free education and health care, we are putting our population into a deeper hole of debt, crime and stupidity. A smart and healthy population can contribute to society much more than the status quo (in America). Essentially, education and health are lotteries. Some get lucky while most don't. People should not be punished because of this. Investing money into an infrastructure that provides free education and health care is the basis for an advanced society. Hello, users of CMV!

Tsinghua,cmv-244,"The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. It's a major disappointment that the US didn't manage to get any games this time around. It's sad to see that money can be so easily thrown away on a sports event that is of no benefit to the local economy. If we're talking about the global recession and how it has affected the sporting events we're talking about in this article, let's just take a look at the 2012 Olympics in London. The British government spent an estimated 5.3 billion on the event. That's an average of 128 million per square mile. Even more, the local economy saw a decrease in economic activity as a result of the Olympics, because people couldn't afford to travel and many businesses suffered. You may not think that the Olympics have an impact on the economy, but when you consider the fact that most people in London make less than 30,000 per year, the Olympics have a huge impact on the city's economy. If the games had been in Chicago, they would have been one of the biggest economic boons the city has seen in recent history. The host city has a major role to play in the success of an Olympics. Unfortunately, the US has failed to live up to the expectations. Chicago had a fantastic chance to be the host city, but failed to win the bid. This is the third time in the past decade that Chicago has lost the bid to be the host city. It's a shame that Chicago's next Olympics will not be until 2016, when the games will be held in Rio de Janeiro. That city has a lot of potential to host a successful games. In fact, the city is a big part of the reason why the 2016 Olympics are coming to Brazil."

OpenAI,cmv-244,"The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. I understand your concerns about the financial and political implications of hosting the Olympic Games. While the competition can provide significant economic benefits and boost tourism, costs often outweigh these benefits, creating a significant burden to taxpayers of the host country. Moreover, hosting the Olympics can also become a tool for corrupt regimes to enhance their image and distract the population from other issues. However, some countries with strong democracies and transparent institutions successfully hosted the games, avoiding the risks and promoting the positive aspects of this event. Overall, it's essential to thoroughly assess the potential benefits and risks associated with hosting the Olympics, carefully evaluating the economic and political factors involved in the process."
PaLM,cmv-244,"The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) should scrap the current practice and award the games to a rotating group of cities, such as Athens, London, Los Angeles, Paris and Rome. These cities have the infrastructure and expertise to host the games without going into debt. The IOC would save money and the games would be more sustainable. The IOC has argued that the host country model is necessary to spread the Olympic spirit around the world. However, this argument is disingenuous. The IOC is not interested in spreading the Olympic spirit; it is interested in making money. The host country model is a way for the IOC to extract huge sums of money from cities that are desperate to host the games. The cost of hosting the Olympics has skyrocketed in recent years. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi cost Russia an estimated $51 billion. The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro cost Brazil an estimated $13 billion. These costs are unsustainable for most cities. The IOC knows this, but it continues to award the games to cities that cannot afford them. The host country model also favors corrupt regimes. The IOC has awarded the games to countries with poor human rights records, such as China, Russia and Qatar. These countries have used the Olympics as a way to whitewash their human rights abuses. The IOC needs to reform the way it awards the Olympic games. The current system is unfair, unsustainable and corrupt. The IOC should scrap the host country model and award the games to a rotating group of cities. This would save money, make the games more sustainable and reduce the risk of corruption."

Human,cmv-245,"So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. (I'm not here to argue whether or not it was, as the investigation is still ongoing and many developments have yet to come, but for the purpose of this discussion I'm going to assume it was.) Much like with the Elliot Rodgers case, there are many people already stating that this is purely a mental health issue and it's just the liberal media drumming up a race war and etc. I don't think it's fair to detract from those arguments, as there are many many people with mental illnesses living non-violently. Even if people with certain mental illnesses have a higher chance of committing violence, and even if most mass murderers do have some kind of mental illness, it shouldn't detract from the fact that there are social motivators that led them ultimately to taking others' lives. The reason I say it's ""disingenuous"" to downplay them is because it allows people who believe there's nothing wrong (eg. that racism is still a major problem) to persuade others that there's nothing wrong, even though there's evidence in the form of the killings that there's still a problem. In this case, it was the suspect's surrounding himself with racist rhetoric that led him so far down a path of hatred towards black people that he acted violently against them. In Elliot Rodger's case, it was his intense hatred of women not sleeping with him (and resentment of other men he saw as his'competitors that ultimately led him to go on his spree. I believe that bigoted hatred should also be addressed alongside mental illness, and shouldn't be downplayed by the media or the public whenever these issues arise. Especially since not all killers are mentally ill, and so addressing these motivators will still help reduce violence."

The most egregious example against this to me is [California prop 13] 1978 which freezes property taxes when you buy a house, essentially subsidizing long-term residents at the cost of more recent arrivals. The basic reasoning for this is twofold. First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are. In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own. Second is an efficiency issue. Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as [this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.] Hello, users of CMV!

Tsinghua,cmv-246,"This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use the property is put to. Let's say a house is worth 100,000. The owner wants to put it on the market for 150,000. That is a fair market value. If the house is sold for 150,000, then the tax bill will be based on the market value. If the owner decides to sell the house to a family for 100,000, the owner should pay taxes based on the market value. This is true of all properties, no matter what they are used for. What do you think? ""Fair market value"" is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. That's not how real estate taxes are assessed, though. The market value is irrelevant. All property taxes are based on assessed value. This is the same for residential, commercial and industrial properties. Assessed value is determined by the county. The assessment rolls are reviewed every two years. It is up to the county to determine the assessed value of the property. It may use an appraisal, but it is ultimately the county's call. The value is determined by a three-member appraisal board. The county attorney serves as chair, the county treasurer as vice chair and the county assessor as secretary. All three are appointed by the county board. They are required to be residents of the county, to be freeholders, to have a professional appraisal qualification, and to live within 20 miles of the county. The board has 150 days to review the appraisals. The county auditor must send the board the assessments for the 2012 tax year by Jan. 31. In addition to reviewing the assessment rolls, the appraisal board reviews applications for exemptions from the assessment. For the 2013 tax year, the county is setting the assessment roll at 1,052,265,340. That is a decrease of 1.3 percent from the 2012 roll. The county will levy a tax rate of 3.5 percent. That will bring in 44.8 million in revenue. I think the assessor should have the final say on the assessment of property. If a homeowner wants to sell the property for a different amount than what the assessor thinks it is worth, the homeowner should be able to sell it for that higher amount. The seller would have to pay the difference between the two prices. The county assessor could then assess the property at the higher price. This would be a fair way to do it. If the assessor determines that the property is worth 100,000, then the seller should be taxed on that amount. The assessor should not be able to make a personal assessment on the property. I know it will be difficult to change the current assessment system, but I think it is important to do. I think the county assessor is making an honest effort to keep the assessment rolls current. He does a good job of that. I think the assessor should be able to make a personal assessment on a property if he wants to. He is the one that knows the value of the property. But I think the final decision should be the county board's. If the assessor makes a personal assessment, then the county board should be able to override it. That is how it should be. The 2013 assessment rolls are not final yet. They are only an estimate. The county board will make a final decision at its meeting in April. It will be interesting to see what happens. I think the county assessor is doing a good job. He should be allowed to make a personal assessment if he wants to. I think the final decision should be the county board's. I don't like how the assessor has the final say on what is assessed. The assessor is not familiar with the property. I think the county board should be able to override the assessor's assessment. The county assessor should have the final say on what is assessed. If a homeowner wants to sell the property for a different amount than what the assessor thinks it is worth, the homeowner should be able to sell it for that higher amount.

It should not matter what the use of the property is; what the current owner paid for it; or who the owner is. The state constitution prohibits the taxing of public charities. This includes all churches. Many of our most valuable properties are tax exempt. It may not be a problem today, but as more and more of the properties are converted into tax exempt uses, the remaining taxpayers will have to pick up the slack. The Board of Assessors should have nothing to do with the assessments. This should be the sole responsibility of the Chief County Assessment Officer. The current system was installed in 1977. The Illinois Department of Revenue should hire a professional management consulting firm to evaluate the entire process and recommend changes.

PaLM,cmv-246,"This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of the property is. All properties should be taxed equally. There are a few reasons for this. First, it is the fairest way to tax property. If a property is worth more, it should be taxed more. This is because the owner of the property is benefiting from the increased value of the property. They should be paying more in taxes to help support the community. Second, it is the most efficient way to tax property. If properties are taxed based on their use, it can be difficult to determine the correct tax rate. This can lead to inequities and disputes. By taxing all properties equally, it is easier to ensure that everyone is paying their fair share. Third, it is the most transparent way to tax property. When all properties are taxed equally, it is easy for taxpayers to understand how much they are paying and why. This can help to build trust between taxpayers and the government. Of course, there are some arguments against taxing all properties equally. Some people argue that it is unfair to tax residential property the same way as commercial property. They argue that residential property is used for essential purposes, while commercial property is used for profit. They believe that residential property owners should be taxed at a lower rate than commercial property owners. However, I believe that the benefits of taxing all properties equally outweigh the drawbacks. It is the fairest, most efficient, and most transparent way to tax property."
BigScience,cmv-246,"This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use or purpose for that property was - it would still have to pay a similar amount every year, regardless. With regards your question about ""what you and I could do..."" The way I've seen this before has been, when someone just wants to buy more land without any plans to build anything with said land they can usually get away w paying tax at a lower rate than standard. For example if you're buying 1 acre in San Diego (which by my understanding has a higher minimum threshold) and are only planning on using one third as needed maybe 100 feet from shore it's easy enough to draw up ""inventory depreciation"" statements showing how much of an investment you're making in the area and make sure their annual amortization cost doesn't go over 6 which puts them under the special usage exemption for having something built there instead of being able to put money into the same kind of vacant lot elsewhere where they'd likely end up building (i'm pretty certain I don't know everything). If nothing else its good practice while keeping things simple during negotiations but also staving off unnecessary sales fees."
OpenAI,cmv-246,"This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of the property is. The fair market value should reflect the value of the land and any improvements made to it, regardless of whether it is used for residential, commercial, or other purposes. Furthermore, the assessment process should be transparent and accessible to property owners, so they understand how their taxes are calculated and have the ability to contest their assessments if they believe they are incorrect. Additionally, taxes should be applied consistently across all properties in the same tax jurisdiction. Finally, taxes collected should be allocated to provide essential services to the community, including schools, public safety, and infrastructure. The distribution of tax revenue should be fair and equitable to ensure that all members of the community receive necessary services, regardless of their income or property value."
LLAMA,cmv-247,"I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate black people, they did nothing for the community, they were nothing but white supremacists who were on there to troll, post pictures of white power signs, and generally be jerks. I'm not going to miss them. Chazor, Oct 1, 2015 It's a thing to post a picture of a black guy hugging an Irish cop, with the title 'Black Lives Matter'? Holy shit. I'm not going to claim that Reddit is a beacon of racial equality but that place sounds like a shitshow. And I'm pretty sure Irish cops don't have guns. The Black Lives Matter meme on Reddit has a lot of pictures of black people and cops hugging each other, with the caption 'Black Lives Matter'. It's a gross misrepresentation of the movement that implies that cops have never killed a black person and that it's just a few unruly black people who like to cause trouble. EDIT: Also, I'm pretty sure they do. I'm not sure if they're armed all the time, but I'm sure that they have guns. I'm a woman and I'm not a lesbian, but I also have no sympathy. I just don't like gross pigs. I don't know. I think a lot of it is inevitable. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. Well, it depends on the subreddit. raww for example, that's a subreddit where people post cute animal photos. So that subreddit is full of people who like animals. I'm not talking about liking animals, I'm talking about women getting to the point where they're so sick of men, they turn lesbian. No it's not. It's a troll subreddit. The fact that it's now been removed doesn't mean it was legitimate. It's not a troll subreddit. It's a subreddit where black people post about their experiences, their culture, and their lives. There's also an rasianamerican and rindianamerican, and I've never heard of either of those being described as troll subreddits. There's a difference between ""trolls post on the subreddit"" and ""the subreddit is a troll subreddit."" You're really defending this? Are you seriously telling me that most of the people who post on coontown aren't trolls? These are the same kind of people who have been harassing Leslie Jones for the past few days. Yeah I don't see how that's not a troll subreddit. If you aren't black, you're going to get a lot of shit thrown at you on there. They're probably the first to call you a race traitor too if you say anything that isn't in their favour. We're not talking about the average person who posts on there, we're talking about the people who harassed Leslie Jones. They were on that subreddit. There's a difference between ""trolls post on the subreddit"" and ""the subreddit is a troll subreddit."" I don't go around to people who use 4chan and call them trolls. There's a difference between a person who posts on a troll subreddit and a troll subreddit. We're not talking about the average person who posts on there, we're talking about the people who harassed Leslie Jones. They were on that subreddit.Yes, they were. Average people can be trolls. This is why I said ""If you aren't black, you're going to get a lot of shit thrown at you on there."" But that's not the subreddit's fault, that's the people who are posting on it. I'm not saying it's their fault. I'm just saying that I'm not going to miss them if they're banned, because they're not good people. How do you know they're not good people? I'm sure you've never interacted with them before, why are you calling them ""bad people""? How do you know"

These people hate me, and I hate them, plain and simple, and I am happy it made their lives even slightly worse. However, the main response to it from neutral people has been that it sets a bad precedent. But again, I don't care if all hate subreddits are banned. People have said that it is the issue of how to define what a hate subreddit is, but I just think that this is a diversionary argument of semantics. The difference between, say Coontown, and Shitredditsays is light and day, and anyone who says different needs to walk a mile in other peoples shoes. The final argument against seems to be that the banning of coontown was for reasons of brigading, and that this was wrong. If this is the case, then Shitredditsays should be banned too, and I certainly wouldn't miss it, but I really wouldn't argue that Coontown should be brought back. For obvious reasons. So reddit, what am I missing? Change my view!"

But, obviously, there has been massive evidence pointing towards his racism over the last decade, which does NOT justify his actions."

BigScience,cmv-248,"Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that later). I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to pull off a full-on 'Newt' look but I've been considering the possibility. My favourite Newts include Michael Moore on his videos such as Citizenfour and Fahrenheit 911, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden who have both become shining examples of defiance against surveillance governments worldwide. It seems like most people are pretty disgusted with Trump's presidency so it isn't surprising that people are looking at other options. I think there will always be some kind of liberal movement existing within any system or regime; however these movements should never assume they can affect things from the outside simply by laying down protest signs and holding peaceful demonstrations. This has proved true time after time over history where constant passive involvement only leads to further oppression. The best way we could hope to make change happen is through real action which needs to stem from everyday individuals taking ownership of their lives and choosing how they want to live them rather than being dictated into doing what someone else thinks is right or acceptable without even really understanding why."

Tsinghua,cmv-248,"Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that in a minute). Secondly, I'm very proud of our new government. I was a Liberal Democrat supporter in the past and I thought the Liberal Democrats were not far off my ideals. I'm glad I'm wrong and that I'm back with the Tories. I'm not as enthusiastic about Cameron as I was about Brown, but I am pleased that he has done what I think he should have done (I don't agree with him about the Iraq War, but I'm a bit disappointed that he didn't press on with that idea, but I'm glad he has changed his mind). I'm very proud of the Conservatives and I'm very proud of the new government. I'm proud that we're making Britain a fairer, more equal and better place. But I'm very concerned about the direction in which we're going. I'm concerned that we're moving away from the centre ground and we're going to be looking to more extreme right-wing parties to support us in the future. I'm concerned that we're becoming more populist and less responsible and I'm concerned that we're becoming more right-wing. So I'm not a fan of the 2010 election and I think that it has made our party even more extreme. The one thing that worries me is that there are people in the Conservative Party who think that Cameron is a new Thatcher. I think that he is very different to Thatcher, but I'm worried that he's going to move us even further to the right. We need to think about what we stand for and we need to make sure that we are a responsible party. I'm concerned that we're becoming a bit more populist and less responsible. So the first thing that I would like to do is to make sure that we have a proper discussion in the party about what we stand for. I would like to see a debate in the party about the direction in which we're going. I think that we should talk about whether we want to move further to the right or whether we want to be more responsible and moderate. I'm not sure that the Conservatives have the ability to move further to the right. There are a lot of people in the party who have already moved to the right, but I'm not sure that they're capable of moving further to the right. I'm not sure that they're capable of seeing what's right about the Conservative Party. So I think that we should have a debate in the party about whether we want to move further to the right or whether we want to be more responsible and moderate. And that debate should be joined by people from the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. And we should also have a debate about the future of the NHS and social security. We should talk about the future of the NHS. I think that the NHS is a big issue for people. I'm worried that there are people in the party who are trying to move the NHS to the right. I think that there are some people in the party who think that we should reduce the number of people on the NHS. I think that's wrong. I think that we should look at what the NHS needs and I think that we should look at how we pay for the NHS. I think that there are a lot of people in the party who think that the NHS is the problem and not the solution. I think that the NHS is a good thing. I think that we should be proud of the NHS. I think that the NHS is a good thing and I think that we should be proud of the NHS. But I'm worried that there are people in the party who are trying to move the NHS to the right.

Human,cmv-248,"Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV. I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such. I understand that the state assumes the right of the child the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life. Or on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child. Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex. TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment. EDIT: Slight confusioncomments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her ""pro choice,"" however fathers have the right to ""opt out"" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it. EDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood."" TheScamr worded this nicely: Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition: consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally. EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think uBilly90 put forward the best argument against this. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

PaLM,cmv-248,"Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that later). I’ve been reading a lot about the current state of the US economy and I’m concerned about the growing wealth gap. The top 1% of earners now take home more than 20% of the nation’s income, while the bottom 50% of earners take home less than 13%. This gap has been growing wider for decades, and it’s only getting worse. I believe that this growing wealth gap is a major problem for a number of reasons. First, it’s simply unfair. It’s wrong that a small number of people should have so much while so many others have so little. Second, it’s bad for the economy. When the rich get richer, they tend to spend less of their money, which slows down economic growth. Third, it’s bad for society. When there’s a big gap between the rich and the poor, it leads to social unrest and division. There are a number of things that can be done to address the growing wealth gap. One is to raise taxes on the wealthy. Another is to provide more support for the poor and working class. We can also make it easier for people to start their own businesses and create jobs. I believe that it’s important to address the growing wealth gap because it’s a major problem for our country. It’s unfair, it’s bad for the economy, and it’s bad for society. I hope that we can work together to find solutions to this problem. In addition to the economic arguments against the growing wealth gap, there are also a number of moral arguments. One is that it’s simply wrong for some people to have so much while others have so little. Another is that the growing wealth gap is a threat to democracy. When a small number of people have so much power, they can use it to influence the government in ways that benefit themselves at the expense of the rest of society. The growing wealth gap is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. We need to find ways to make the economy more fair and to ensure that everyone has a chance to succeed. Here are some specific policies that I believe would help to address the growing wealth gap:  Increase taxes on the wealthy. The top 1% of earners in the United States take home more than 20% of the nation’s income, while the bottom 50% of earners take home less than 13%. This gap has been growing wider for decades, and it’s only getting worse. I believe that we need to raise taxes on the wealthy in order to help to close this gap.  Provide more support for the poor and working class. The poor and working class are the hardest hit by the growing wealth gap. They are more likely to live in poverty, to be unemployed, and to have inadequate access to healthcare and education. We need to do more to support these groups of people. We can do this by providing them with more financial assistance, by expanding access to healthcare and education, and by creating more jobs.  Make it easier for people to start their own businesses. One of the best ways to help people to escape poverty is to help them to start their own businesses. Small businesses create jobs and generate economic growth. We need to make it easier for people to start their own businesses by providing them with access to capital, training, and support. I believe that these are just a few of the things that we can do to address the growing wealth gap. It’s a complex problem, but it’s one that we need to address. We need to make sure that everyone has a chance to succeed, regardless of their economic background. Thank you for your time."
OpenAI,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it's great that you recognize that. It's important to understand that rape is a traumatic experience that can happen to anyone, regardless of their gender. While the physical act may be different due to anatomy, the emotional impact can be just as devastating for both male and female survivors. It's important to approach the issue of rape and sexual assault with empathy and sensitivity, and to support survivors in their healing process regardless of their gender. If you or someone you know has experienced rape or sexual assault, it's important to seek professional help and support from resources like RAINN or a local rape crisis center."
LLAMA,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I do not discount the fact that it is a horrible crime, but something about it just feels off. I'm also aware that in the USA, 99 of rapists are men and 90 of victims are women, so it does not really seem like I should be thinking of rape as something that is less of a problem when it happens to men. I'm not trying to troll or offend, I'm just curious as to how other people feel about this. (Made a new account just for this thread because I didn't want any of my friends to see this if I'm wrong about my views) Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone! I understand now that the issue is much more complex than just ""female rape"" vs. ""male rape."" I feel like I have a better understanding of the subject now. Dinoceros 34 points35 points36 points 3 years ago (1 child) Rape is rape, but the male experience is different because there are different reasons for why people rape males. It's not the same as female rape in that it's not about control or punishment. Instead, it's about homophobia. It's about ""turning"" them. It's about making them gay. It's about assuming they are gay. It's about power. It's about dominating them. So it's different, and I think it's better to compare it to female rape by a woman than male rape by a man. robfosbury 10 points11 points12 points 3 years ago (1 child) As a male rape survivor, I agree. It's different. The rapes I experienced happened in prison, and were not about power or dominance as much as they were about sexual release. The guards used to turn the lights off at night in the tier, so it was easy for someone to slip in and out of another guy's cell. A lot of the guys I met were homosexual, and were in prison for crimes they committed as a result of their homosexuality (exposing themselves in public, being caught with a teenager, etc). Some of these guys were some of the nicest people I met in prison. They were lonely, and they needed sex. So, they would walk around the tier at night and ask men to have sex with them. I said no. They didn't care. I could try to fight back, but these guys were bigger than me. I could scream, but they could kill me if they wanted to. These guys would sneak into my cell at night and tell me they would fuck me, whether I liked it or not. It's not the same as female rape, because the rapes were about sex, not power. I don't want to sound like a misogynist, but I think that the reason female rape is considered so bad is because of the power aspect. The reason male rape in prison is considered so bad is because the men who do it are considered untouchable. Anyway, I agree with the original poster, male rape is different. I'd like to hear more about your experience, if you're comfortable sharing. Dinoceros 5 points6 points7 points 3 years ago (0 children) I think it's similar, but the men who do it are typically not untouchable. In fact, they often can be further victimized by other inmates for ""being a fag"" (or they can be threatened with rape again). emilythorne420 9 points10 points11 points 3 years ago (1 child) I think you're on the right track. It's just that there are so many factors in the realm of rape. Rape is all about power and control. I don't think rape is ever the same, no matter what sexes are involved. brysonbuck 5 points6 points7 points 3 years ago (0 children) CodyJH 4 points5 points6 points 3 years ago (2 children) Its less about the gender of the victim and more about what the rapist is trying to gain from the act.

BigScience,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and if the girl was drunk or incapacitated then there are even more reasons to prosecute - but still... It seems like you can only be so sure about this in your head after all. I think it's kind of funny how people in these cases always seem to blame one party for being ""impulsive"" when there's almost no evidence on either side. Apparently it isn't enough to simply say ""you're having consensual sex"" anymore? If that's not good enough, what does ""consenting"" mean? Why do we constantly talk about consentinggiving consentnot giving consent as if they were mutually exclusive things (which they're not)? There's probably no point talking at length about every possible scenario here because: 1) We can't know everything 2) No matter how much research is done, rape will never completely go away 3) The courts aren't going to change their mind. 4:59 PM 5089 The judge said he has little sympathy for women who claim to give some form of mutual agreement while getting raped by men PSA: This woman should wear a thong under her clothes whenever she goes out, especially into public restrooms where there's an abundance of weak-minded males who might feel anything from mild attraction towards themselves to actual sexual desire"
PaLM,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors, I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and that both men and women can be victims of sexual assault. However, I still find it difficult to understand how a man could be raped by a woman. I think part of the reason for this is that I've always seen rape as a crime of power and dominance. In my mind, a man who is raped is seen as being weak and emasculated. This is a harmful stereotype that needs to be challenged. Men can be victims of sexual assault just as much as women, and it is important to remember that rape is never the victim's fault. Another reason why I have trouble equating female rape with male rape is that I've never seen a man being raped in real life. I've seen plenty of depictions of female rape in movies and TV shows, but I've never seen a movie or TV show that depicts a man being raped. This is likely because male rape is still a taboo subject that is not often discussed. I think it's important to talk about male rape more openly so that we can challenge the harmful stereotypes that surround it. We need to make it clear that men can be victims of sexual assault just as much as women, and that rape is never the victim's fault.

Tsinghua,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I'm not saying that women can't be raped, but the comparison doesn't seem right to me. As a woman, I would be appalled if a man tried to force himself on me, but I wouldn't really care if a man forced himself on me. I'm not saying that I would consent to it, but I wouldn't be bothered. I'm not sure if this is just because I'm a feminist or what, but I don't really care what happens to a man as long as he's not hurting anyone else. I don't even think that women should have to have sex with men just because they're horny. I just feel that men are weaker than women and that we should be giving them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to rape. Any thoughts on this?"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and since it's happening to females in this situation as well there has got be some validity behind the idea which stops me from seeing how you judge males for being raped by women (even though technically they are). That said; your post was very good overall but had one major flaw: The fact remains - having someone forcefully penetrate another person without their consent IS RAPE no matter what title or pronouns we use when describing those who commit such acts against others - whether its ""he"" versus an individual womangirl whose age makes her seem more like she rather than he does not change anything about reality except maybe making people feel less uncomfortable reading things written on TV news websites where only statistics get used instead text boxes probably because political correctness will make them lose money if everyone knew why certain word selections were made...? All other points aside my main issue here would also apply towards any type victims including children....and yes even animals left uncared too.. (but i guess thats always going back into natural selection) so long story short despite most posters seeming socially unethical behaviour toward these girls im still gonna support survivors all around ive been through hell before losing everything then coming out better off after years spent alone away form anyone important at time...so go suckle ur mumma.....or do u prefer breast milk....lol"
Human,cmv-249,"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. The reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's ""prey"" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. Whenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women. I guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. I really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone. Please tell my why I should think of male rape as bad as female rape. Again, I really want my view to change. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Human,cmv-250,"I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic] . I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) ""the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film.... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing."" This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character. Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching 13 Days (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that ""For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever.... that's absurd."" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified. Thus, I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance: ""They're claiming to be based on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate."" Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take'based on truth' to mean'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dateseventsquotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun. ""The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson."" But to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows absolutely nothing about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching JFK (1991). And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong. ""It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened."" Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film:'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, ""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson. This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly? Okay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on Pocahontas (1995) and Argo (2012 - please CMV! EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments.

What is really disheartening is how often I find that things were dramatized for the film's sake, or that the people and events weren't portrayed accurately. Is this normal, or are there some films that are more factual and reliable than others? Does it seem like more films are not very factual? Has the internet changed the way films portray facts and history? Does it seem like filmmakers are getting less factual with their films? Historical films are notorious for not being very factual. While one might argue that many of these films are loosely based on real events, I have to ask why filmmakers are not more careful to preserve the truth. I realize that you can't fit everything into a film, and that artistic license is necessary. My issue is with films that take an extreme liberty with the facts, or in some cases, simply make stuff up. If you want to know what really happened, read a book. I am a huge fan of historical films. It's interesting to see the events, people, and places portrayed on the screen. With the emergence of the internet, it is easier than ever to discover the facts. This is a good thing, as the filmmakers are being held more accountable for their portrayals. I'm not saying that all historical films are untrue. I'm sure that there are many that are very accurate, or at least mostly accurate. But I'm saying that it seems to me that there are also a lot of films that play pretty fast and loose with the facts. It seems that filmmakers are getting more and more inaccurate in their portrayals of history. The films are more entertaining. The filmmakers know that most people aren't interested in accuracy, they want to be entertained. The internet is just going to make them more careful about being accurate. The filmmakers are taking extreme liberties with the truth in order to make their films more entertaining. The internet will make them more careful about being accurate. Filmmakers are getting lazier and more careless with the facts. The internet will make them more careful about being accurate. The internet has made it easier than ever to discover the facts, and filmmakers are more careful than ever to be accurate.

Tsinghua,cmv-250,"I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was horrified to read that it was based on a true story. I'm sure it was, but still... It was also fascinating to read that Alan Turing's work on cracking the Enigma Code during WWII was one of the most important things he ever did. I think it's also interesting that he was the first person to use a computer (a Turing Machine) to help him with his work. In the end, I still think the film was very well done, but I have to admit I'm not that excited about Turing's story. I think I'm too young to appreciate it.... maybe I'll read up more about him later. A couple of weeks ago, I was working on my speech for my language lab class. I chose to talk about math and how it affects the world around us. One of the points I wanted to make was that math is not only for scientists, but for everyone. I don't know about you, but I don't think it's hard to come up with a problem in life that doesn't have a mathematical solution. I think a lot of people just don't know how to look for one. I was talking about this with my friends, and they said, ""I'm not sure math is a good subject for a freshman."" To which I said, ""Well, I'm not sure what you should study in college either, but I know that math is something you can use for everything."" A few weeks ago, I decided to take a look at the courses that I have in my Calculus class. I'm not sure what's going on in the class, but I do know that there are a few things I'd like to learn. I've decided to take a look at the course list to see if I can figure out which one I'd like to take next semester. I have an English class that I'm planning on taking next semester, so I figured I'd start with the next best thing, and that's Calculus 2. So I looked at the course description for Calculus 2, and I noticed that there are two different courses. One is a prerequisite, and the other is an elective. I had to think about this for a second, and I decided that the elective course sounded better. I took a look at the prerequisite course, and the prerequisite course sounded pretty hard. It's a course in statistics, which is a subject that I don't really like, but I do know that it's important for business majors. After looking at the course description, I decided that I wasn't sure I could handle that course. It's really math-heavy, and it's not something that I've ever studied. I have no idea if I'm going to like it. I don't know if I'll be able to do it, but I don't want to get stuck taking something that I can't do. I took a look at the elective course, and the elective course is something that I can do. It's a little more simple, and I think it will be something that I can get through. I'm taking the elective course next semester. If you want to check out the courses I'm taking next semester, I've listed them below. (The Calculus courses are the ones that are in red) Calculus 2, Calculus 3, Statistics, and AP Calculus AB. I've decided to take Calculus 2 next semester. I'm taking it because it's a prerequisite for my Business Statistics class. I'm also taking Calculus 3, but I'm not sure if I'm going to take that next semester. I'm taking it now because I want to make sure I'm ready for it. I want to be sure that I'm going to be able to do it, and that I'm going to be able to pass it. I want to take AP Calculus AB next semester, but I'm not sure if I'm going to take that next semester. I'm taking it now because I want to make sure I'm ready for it. I want to be sure that I'm going to be able to do it, and that I'm going to be able to pass it. I want to take AP Calculus BC next semester, but I'm not sure if I'm going to take that next semester.

PaLM,cmv-252,"I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article], which argues that the American Revolution was not inevitable. The author, Gordon Wood, argues that the American colonists were not united in their desire for independence, and that the British government was not as oppressive as is often portrayed. He also argues that the Revolution was not a result of economic factors, but rather of political and cultural differences between the colonists and the British. Wood's argument is controversial, and many historians disagree with his conclusions. However, his work has been influential, and it has sparked a debate about the causes of the American Revolution. One of the main criticisms of Wood's argument is that he underestimates the role of economic factors in the Revolution. Wood argues that the colonists were not motivated by economic concerns, but rather by political and cultural differences. However, many historians argue that the colonists were deeply concerned about their economic rights, and that these concerns were a major factor in the Revolution. For example, the colonists were upset about the British government's policies of taxation and trade regulation. They believed that these policies were designed to benefit the British economy at the expense of the colonists. The colonists also felt that the British government was not giving them a fair voice in the political process. They were denied representation in Parliament, and they felt that their interests were not being taken into account by the British government. The colonists' economic and political grievances were compounded by cultural differences between the colonists and the British. The colonists were largely Protestant, while the British were largely Catholic. The colonists also had a different view of the relationship between church and state. The colonists believed in religious freedom, while the British government was closely allied with the Church of England. These cultural differences made it difficult for the colonists to work with the British government. The colonists felt that the British government was not respecting their rights and values, and they were increasingly willing to take up arms against the British. In conclusion, Wood's argument that the American Revolution was not inevitable is controversial. However, his work has been influential, and it has sparked a debate about the causes of the American Revolution. There is no doubt that the Revolution was a complex event, and there are many factors that contributed to it. However, it is clear that the colonists were deeply concerned about their economic and political rights, and that these concerns were a major factor in the Revolution.

This doesn't allow any other word. There are two points (1) why ""They"" refers to all people. 1. The ""Maybe we should go see if there's anyone else around?"" indicates the speaker has seen someone else in close proximity and wishes to clarify their identity. Nothing stops them from asking ""How do you know each other? Where did your paths cross?"" or ""Where were you going together before they found out about us?""

Human,cmv-252,"I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article] , which is fascinating if you just fancy some historical reading. Basically, if Napoleon has won at Waterloo, and completed his conquest of Europe (bar Russia, of course, and maybe England), the continent would have flourished economically, socially and politically, more so than now. I will highlight the main points below. 1. Revolutionary domestic reforms which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from. ""Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon's years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lycees and grandes ecoles and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the Legion d'Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful - the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs - and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vendome column."" Napoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe based their institutions on, only much later. 2. Napoleon was a lover, not a fighter. In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon's ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon's peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty. Napoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France's being cut out of Russian markets - in violation of the Tilsit terms - by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Armee too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813. Bar the Russian Invasion mistake (and I will concede that it was a hell of a mistake), Napoleon did not display the characteristics of a warmonger. Upon his return from exile, his charisma as a leader ensured he reclaimed the throne without shedding a drop of blood, as each army sent to fight him joined him immediately. When he was condemned by the allies in the Vienna Declaration, he wrote to them - ""After presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples."" You can argue that it was just posturing, but there is no precedent to suggest it was not genuine. He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that ""henceforth the happiness and the consolidation"" of France ""shall be the object of all my thoughts."" He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. ""Of all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,"" he proclaimed, ""I shall forever remain ignorant."" He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile. He immediately set about refunding the art galleries and public buildings of Paris, in the 12 weeks before the war would begin. 3. Liberalism in the rest of Europe would have thrived. If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world. TL;DR - Napoleon was an all round great dude, and great leader who accomplished so much in such little time. If he had stayed in power for the 6 more years until his death, France and Europe would have benefitted greatly from it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

LLAMA,cmv-252,"I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article] , which I found to be very interesting, if not entirely convincing. I've had difficulty finding more scholarly articles on the subject. The gist of it is that the Mexican and Spanish conquests of the Americas were so brutal because of the extreme brutality of the Aztec empire, who had developed an effective military force through cannibalism, human sacrifice, and the brutalization of the other tribes they'd conquered. This brutality is what made them so effective at resisting the Spanish for as long as they did, as well. The Mayans and Inca were less warlike, and so their conquest was less brutal (though still not particularly kind). Anyway, I'm sure it's not as simple as all that, and I don't have enough knowledge to say for certain whether or not it's true. Thoughts?"

It is interesting to note that the most obvious disagreement between the 1974 thesis and the 1999 thesis is the date of the insurrection, as the 1974 thesis says it was between 1899 and 1900, while the 1999 thesis says it was in 1900. I have edited the transcript below to remove some of the punctuation, and to add more detail where I think it is necessary.

I am going to quote some material from a thesis by Professor Stoddard. He has written on the subject for many years and is the foremost authority in the world on the subject. He has written on the Mormons in New York, in Canada, and in the Philippines. His bibliography is 3000 pages long. Here is the opening paragraph from his thesis on the Mormons in the Philippines: ""The Mormons have been the subject of much written and printed matter, but in the Philippines they have received scant attention. In fact, the Philippine Mormons, while interesting in themselves, have almost entirely escaped the notice of writers on the subject. ""The earliest records of the Mormons in the Philippines date from 1873, when two men of the church came to Manila, to work as carpenters. At that time there were but few Mormons in the islands, and they were all in Manila. From 1873 to 1883 the number of Mormons in the Philippines was probably in the neighborhood of two hundred. ""In 1883, a man by the name of Heber C. Kimball was sent by the church to work in the Philippines. His labors were not successful. ""From 1883 to 1891, there were very few Mormons in the islands. They were confined to Manila. ""In 1891, the first Mormons were sent to Mindanao. They came from the states, and went by the steamship ""Philippine."" They established a mission station at Bohol, and in 1893 moved to Mindanao. They were in Mindanao for four years, when they were transferred to Manila, where they remained until 1898. ""In 1898, they were transferred to the islands of Mindanao, Panay, Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, and the Isthmus of Panay. They remained in these islands for two years, when they were transferred to Luzon, to Manila. They remained in Manila until 1900, when they were transferred to the islands of Mindanao, Panay, Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, and the Isthmus of Panay. They remained in these islands until 1902, when they were transferred to the islands of Luzon, to Manila. They remained in Manila until 1905, when they were transferred to the islands of Mindanao, Panay, Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, and the Isthmus of Panay. They remained in these islands until 1908, when they were transferred to the islands of Luzon, to Manila.

Tsinghua,cmv-253,"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single men and women both seem to have different expectations about the way a relationship should work, but for different reasons. If we look at the man's perspective, he's frustrated because women don't seem to be interested in a real relationship with him. If we look at the woman's perspective, she's frustrated because she can't seem to find a man that she can love and respect. These are the most common feelings we hear from singles. So, why are we seeing this so much more now than we did in the past? As we look at the history of our culture, we can see that it's been a long time since men and women had to work so hard to get a woman to have sex with them. We can also see that it's been a long time since men and women had to work so hard to find a job and support their family. It seems that the days of traditional marriage and family are dying out, and we're in the midst of a new paradigm shift. Many women and men are now taking a more active role in building their careers and families. They're looking for companionship, but not necessarily a spouse. They're looking for a soul mate, but not necessarily a husband. Women and men are seeking relationships that have a greater sense of personal growth, emotional connection, and spiritual fulfillment. Emotional connection. Spiritual fulfillment. Personal growth. These are the things that we want in our relationships, but they're not necessarily what we're getting. Why? There are a few reasons. The first reason is that we're being bombarded by all kinds of dating, relationship, and sex advice. We're being taught how to find the right woman and the right man, how to flirt, how to keep the conversation going, how to get a woman to sleep with you, and how to maintain a relationship with a woman once you've gotten her to sleep with you. But none of these things really help you in your quest for a soul mate. The second reason is that there's a new social environment that's encouraging people to pursue a one-night stand. People are getting married later, and the divorce rate is at an all-time high. So people are trying to maximize their sexual experience, even if that means that they're sleeping with more than one person at a time. The third reason is that the economy is changing. People are working longer hours and they're taking more vacations. The average American now works about 40 hours a week, which is a lot more than in the past. People are working more, so they're going out to bars and clubs less. They're spending less time with their friends, and they're having less of a social life. So, they're looking for companionship outside of the social scene. The fourth reason is that we're living in a post-Christian society. We're no longer in the age of the church. And many people are wondering why God has allowed this. They're wondering why God has allowed a divorce rate of 50 and a marriage rate of 10. They're wondering why God has allowed a 50 divorce rate and a 10 marriage rate. They're wondering why God has allowed the highest teen pregnancy rate in the world. And they're wondering why God has allowed an increase in sexually transmitted diseases and the highest number of STDs in the world. So they're looking for a spiritual fulfillment that they can't get from a church or from a friend. The fifth reason is that many people don't feel like they have a purpose in life. They're looking for a greater meaning, a greater sense of purpose, and a greater sense of meaning in their life. The sixth reason is that many people are looking for someone who has similar interests to them. They want to share their life with someone who loves to travel, or who loves to garden, or who loves to read, or who loves to sing, or who loves to work on cars, or who loves to paint, or who loves to cook, or who loves to learn, or who loves to play tennis, or who loves to play golf. They want someone who is just like them, but they're not willing to settle for that. The seventh reason is that many people are looking for a companion. They're not looking for a spouse, but they're looking for someone who will support them, who will love them, and who will understand them. So, what's a guy to do?"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-253,"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single men have higher levels than single women do because their peers include many older married people who don't want the young bucks around anymore-that's why it shows up as a gender difference at all ages but not when you just look across age categories (like 25-34). The ""all couples"" line still lags significantly below where we would expect given how much more likely males were born into wealthy families on average over time: If I had any doubts about my own prejudices before becoming involved with dating websites, those vanished after reading several articles like.

OpenAI,cmv-253,"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single people may feel lonely or isolated, and seeking out companionship is a natural human desire. Additionally, some people may feel that the traditional dating scene is superficial or lacking in genuine connection, and may feel that seeking out a relationship with a professional matchmaker is a more authentic way to find a compatible partner. However, it is important to note that there are also potential downsides to using a matchmaker, such as the cost and the possibility of being disappointed if the matchmaker is not successful in finding a compatible partner. Ultimately, whether or not to use a matchmaker is a personal decision that each individual must make based on their own preferences and circumstances."
PaLM,cmv-253,"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustrated/critical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single men are often portrayed as being lonely and desperate, and this stereotype can lead to negative attitudes towards them. However, single men are just as varied as single women, and there are many reasons why someone might choose to remain single. For some, it may be a matter of personal preference, while for others, it may be due to circumstances beyond their control. Whatever the reason, single men should not be stereotyped as being lonely or desperate. They are simply people who are choosing to live their lives differently, and they deserve to be respected."
LLAMA,cmv-253,"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single young men in their sexual prime are rarely going to be satisfied with a purely platonic relationship. So, they're either going to find a woman who can offer them something that is close enough to an adult sexual relationship, or they are going to remain frustrated and get into trouble. She's the first woman I've been with who does not have any issues with it and I love her for that. And after she turned 18 we started dating and have been dating ever since. I was raped in college, and there was no man for me. He wanted to be my first. She was dating a boy a couple of years older than her and he was very good looking. Until you guys grow up and stop thinking you're better than other people, you will continue to be single and lonely. I want to have my first time be with a girl."

It's good that you have taken the time to gather information and experience firsthand what living in New York City is like.

In the end though... yes you can travel anywhere with a student visa (as long as your home countrystate decides that's okay), so why wouldn't any destination work?"
PaLM,cmv-254,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against it. Here are a few reasons why:  The cost of living is astronomical. NYC is one of the most expensive cities in the world, and it's only getting more expensive. A one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan can easily cost over $3,000 per month, and even a studio apartment in a less desirable neighborhood can cost upwards of $2,000. If you're not making six figures, it's going to be very difficult to afford to live in NYC.  The weather is unpredictable. NYC has four distinct seasons, and each one brings its own challenges. The summers can be hot and humid, the winters can be cold and snowy, and the spring and fall can be rainy and unpredictable. If you don't like dealing with extreme weather, NYC is probably not the best place for you.  The traffic is horrendous. NYC is one of the most congested cities in the world. Rush hour traffic can make getting around a nightmare, and even on a good day, it can take a long time to get from one place to another. If you don't like driving or taking public transportation, NYC is probably not the best place for you.  The crime rate is high. NYC has a higher crime rate than most other major cities in the United States. While the vast majority of crimes are property crimes, there is still a risk of being mugged or assaulted. If you're concerned about safety, NYC may not be the best place for you. Of course, NYC is a great city with a lot to offer. There are endless things to see and do, and the culture is vibrant and diverse. But if you're considering moving to NYC, it's important to be aware of the challenges that come with living in a big city. Here are some additional reasons why I would not want to live in NYC:  The lack of space. NYC is a very densely populated city, and there is very little space. This can make it difficult to find a place to live that is both affordable and spacious.  The noise. NYC is a very noisy city, especially during rush hour. The traffic, the construction, and the people all contribute to the noise pollution. If you're looking for a quiet place to live, NYC is probably not the best option.  The lack of nature. NYC is a concrete jungle, and there is very little green space. This can make it difficult to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. If you're looking for a city with more nature, NYC is probably not the best option. Overall, I think NYC is a great city to visit, but I would not want to live there permanently. The cost of living, the weather, the traffic, the crime rate, and the lack of space are all factors that make it a less-than-ideal place to live."
Human,cmv-254,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston much better than New York. First, it's filthy. There is trash everywhere, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. It's also crowded. NYC has 8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had. The cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great. Then there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homesapartments I've visited. I can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid 800month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. TL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV.

Tsinghua,cmv-254,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set against it. If you are a New Yorker, you are probably aware of how incredibly hostile the city is to immigrants, minorities, the elderly, and anyone who is not a white male. It is a cesspool of privilege and the powerful ruling over the powerless. The police are allowed to harass anyone who looks suspicious, and the system is so tilted in their favor that it is difficult to win any kind of case. I was lucky enough to avoid the police on my last visit. I have no idea how people who are in more need of their help can avoid them. Even when I was a resident, it was a struggle to get a job, rent a room, and do anything without the help of the city. The city has an abysmal record for the elderly, with nursing homes all but monopolized by a small number of companies that treat them as scum. It is a dangerous city to live in, and I don't think I would want to live there if I were a native. I have always thought of London as a kind of prototypical European city, with its medieval history, architecture, and canals. I was very excited to be able to move there and take advantage of all the things that it has to offer. I didn't have much of a budget to start, but it is certainly possible to live on very little in London, and even get by on less than you might think. The British have a tradition of living very simply and with little material possessions, and it has influenced the architecture and design of the city. As a result, London is very cheap to live in, even if you are not a native. You can live on very little, and even travel the world while doing so. I can't imagine living in New York or San Francisco, but London is a great place to start. It is a beautiful city, and you will be able to afford to live in a flat or house that is much nicer than you could in the U.S. You will have a much easier time getting work, and it will be much easier to get a better job. London is a great place to live. But I think it is worth noting that if you are a native of the U.S., moving to London may be a good way to have an adventure while you still have the chance to do so. However, if you have an opportunity to go to London for a job or a university, it is probably a good idea to go. You can probably save a lot of money and still get a great education in London, which will make you a much better employee than you would be if you stayed in the U.S. I am still unsure if I will be moving to London for the job I got, but I am definitely going to go for the education I can get. I will be writing more about this, but for now, I think I will say goodbye to New York. It has been a great place to live, and I will definitely miss it. I have always loved Paris, and I always thought that if I ever got the chance to live there, I would take it. However, I had a terrible experience there that I still don't understand, and I will never understand why it happened. I decided to move to Paris for the job I got there, but I had no idea that it would be a terrible decision. I was never a fan of French people, but I thought that I would be able to get along with the people there. I was wrong. I have spent a lot of time in France, and I have been to Paris many times. I have never been able to get over the way that the French treat their food. It is horrible, and it is probably the most depressing aspect of living there. I am not a huge fan of fast food, but it is better than the French food. I have always had a healthy diet, but I have never been able to stand French food. It is always so sour, and the only things I can eat are the bread and the cheese. The cheese is delicious, but the bread is terrible. It is so stale and so sour that I have never been able to eat it. Even the butter tastes like plastic, and the French never seem to make butter. The only butter I have ever seen in France is the one that they put on the cheese. The butter is so bland that it doesn't even have any taste. I have never been able to get over the French obsession with butter. It is everywhere. I don't even know how they do it, but somehow, they manage to get butter on everything. Even their bread has butter on it, and it is so stale and so sour that it doesn't even taste good. I have never been able to eat French bread."
LLAMA,cmv-254,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set on NOT wanting to live there. I'm not a big city person. I love my small town of 35,000 people, and I'm pretty sure I'd be very unhappy living in NYC. 1. I have to drive. I'm not good at walking, and I have balance issues that would make using the subway nearly impossible. I'd be stuck taking taxis or walking to get around, and I would hate that. 2. I'm not much of a people person, and I think that NYC would be way too overwhelming for me. I'm a social introvert, and I need my alone time to recharge. I don't think I'd get much of it in NYC. 3. I have no desire to live in a city where I have to worry about being mugged every time I leave my house. I know that's not the case for every neighborhood in the city, but I've seen and heard enough to know that it's a possibility. 4. Everything is so damn expensive. I know that my paycheck would probably be higher, but I don't think it would be worth the cost of living. 5. It's not a safe place for animals. If I do end up moving to a city, I'd want to take my dogs with me. 6. Everything is so cramped. I need space. 7. I don't like the weather there. 8. There's nowhere to get away. In Colorado, I can get out of town and into the mountains to hike. I don't have to drive very far to find a quiet place to recharge. It seems like in NYC, you'd always be stuck in the city. 9. I've never seen so many rude people in my life. 10. I wouldn't be able to afford a nice apartment. 11. The traffic is horrible. 12. Parking is a nightmare. 13. I'm not a fan of big cities.

Human,cmv-255,"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for ""sleeping around,"" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. I want to make this point clear - I am NOT debating whether or not it is goodbad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of ""slut."" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified. The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care ofraising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation. Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction. To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue. Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination. The difference between Bob and Patrick is this - Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over 5 billion from his father's trust fund. So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieveaccomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse. Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biologysociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument. To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime."" Thanks!!! Hello, users of CMV!

PaLM,cmv-255,"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around,” and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise. This is because men are seen as being more sexually desirable than women, and therefore, it is seen as more of an accomplishment for a man to have sex with multiple partners. Additionally, men are often seen as being more dominant in relationships, and therefore, it is seen as more natural for them to be the ones who initiate sex. There are a number of problems with this double standard. First, it perpetuates the idea that men and women are not equal. It suggests that men are more valuable than women, simply because they are able to have more sex. This can lead to a number of problems, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, and gender inequality. Second, this double standard can be very damaging to women. It can lead to them feeling insecure about their sexuality, and it can make them feel like they are not as valuable as men. This can lead to a number of problems, such as eating disorders, depression, and anxiety. Finally, this double standard can be very harmful to relationships. It can lead to men and women feeling like they have different expectations of each other, and it can make it difficult for them to communicate about their sexual needs. This can lead to conflict and resentment, and it can ultimately damage the relationship. There are a number of things that can be done to address this double standard. First, we need to challenge the idea that men and women are not equal. We need to teach children that boys and girls are equally valuable, and that they should be treated with respect. We also need to challenge the idea that men are more dominant in relationships. We need to teach men and women to communicate about their sexual needs, and we need to create a society where it is safe for women to say no. Addressing this double standard is not easy, but it is important. We need to create a society where men and women are treated equally, and where everyone can feel safe and respected."
Tsinghua,cmv-255,"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for ""sleeping around,"" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise. As a person of faith, I believe that it is wrong for any man or woman to lie to their spouse about who they have been with. If you are caught lying, you are breaking your marriage vows and you are going to have to deal with the consequences. The rest of this article will deal with the other end of the spectrum, where a man or woman has an affair and then hides it from their spouse. I believe this is also wrong, and that it also breaks a marriage vow. And as a believer in the biblical principles of marriage, I believe that a marriage is a sacred institution and that you should not take it lightly. But when it comes to having an affair, there are some specific rules that should be followed. These are the rules that I have found that will help couples to deal with the fallout from an affair: 1: Tell your spouse that you are having an affair. This is a huge step. It means that you are admitting that you are doing something that you are not supposed to be doing. You are admitting that you are breaking a marriage vow. But if you are honest with your spouse, you are going to have a better chance of getting through the situation. Your spouse will be able to forgive you. You will also be able to move on from this. And you will be able to learn how to avoid this happening again in the future. But this will only happen if you tell your spouse that you are having an affair. And this will only happen if you tell your spouse that you are sorry for having an affair. 2: Keep your affair a secret. I am not talking about keeping it a secret from your spouse. I am talking about keeping it a secret from other people. For example, if you are having an affair with a co-worker, keep that secret. Do not talk about it to other people, do not discuss it with your co-workers, do not mention it in your workplace, do not mention it at your job. And do not mention it at your place of worship. Keep it a secret. Keep it a secret for as long as you can. And if your spouse knows that you are having an affair, keep it a secret from them. Don't talk about it with them. Don't mention it in front of them. Don't talk about it at home. Keep it a secret. 3: Keep it private. This means that you are not going to share this information with your family. You are not going to tell your family about your affair. You are not going to tell your family about your spouse. You are not going to tell your family about your friends. You are not going to tell your family about your co-workers. You are not going to tell your family about your employer. You are not going to tell your family about your children. Keep it private. 4: Don't talk about it with anyone. You are not going to talk about this with anyone. You are not going to tell your friends about your affair. You are not going to tell your co-workers about your affair. You are not going to tell your family about your affair. You are not going to tell your employer about your affair. You are not going to tell your employer about your spouse. You are not going to tell your employer about your children. You are not going to tell your employer about your co-workers. Keep it private. 5: Don't talk about it with anyone. You are not going to talk about this with anyone. You are not going to tell your spouse about your affair. You are not going to tell your spouse about your co-worker. You are not going to tell your spouse about your employer. You are not going to tell your spouse about your children. You are not going to tell your spouse about your friends. You are not going to tell your spouse about your co-workers. You are not going to tell your spouse about your employer. You are not going to tell your spouse about your children. You are not going to tell your spouse about your co-workers. Keep it private. 6: Don't talk about it with anyone. You are not going to talk about this with anyone. You are not going to tell your children about your affair. You are not going to tell your children about your spouse. You are not going to tell your children about your friends. You are not going to tell your children about your co-workers. You are not going to tell your children about your employer. You are not going to tell your children about your employer. You are not going to tell your children about your co-workers. Keep it private. 7: Don't talk about it with anyone. You are not going to talk about this with anyone."

I'm sure you're right, but I think the point here is that if the two sides were reversed, women would be outraged. I think I need to read the book before I can understand your point. This is a book with a point? I would think that the ""point"" is that men and women are different. One is outraged at the idea of a woman having a lot of sex, the other thinks it is funny. As for the book, it's one of those vaguely amusing things I read in college. I can't recommend it, but it was entertaining. I think there's a bigger issue here. The book is a comedy, but it reflects the fact that women in the 80s felt a lot of pressure to be virgins. These days women are having sex a lot earlier (sometimes in middle school), but I think the pressure is less."

The difference between sexual harassment (ie. physical violence) and sexism (discrimination against women on the basis of being female andor their value to men) is important because some people don't realize that they're committing both crimes by saying ""whatever you do...it's your life!

And even further down your own list... what about all those other cases where men are expectedallowed with no questions asked; often they have learned as children from their families justifications like these.

OpenAI,cmv-255,"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for ""sleeping around,"" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise or respect.

It is important to challenge and dismantle these harmful ideas and create a more equitable and just society for all."
Human,cmv-256,"One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one.

LLAMA,cmv-256,"One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. But the current debate over affirmative action is one-sided. It focuses on the positive benefits of diversity and not on the negative effects of the lack of diversity. One example of how this debate is one-sided can be seen in the Supreme Court's treatment of the issue. When the court ruled against the use of affirmative action in the 1978 Bakke case, it said that the University of California's ""inability to point to any specific benefit which would flow from [diversity] in admissions is fatal."" When the court ruled in favor of affirmative action in the recent University of Michigan cases, it said that ""a 'critical mass' of minority students is necessary to ensure that these benefits of diversity will be realized."" These two cases show that the court has a double standard. It expects the University of California to demonstrate that its affirmative action plan will provide a benefit, but it does not require the University of Michigan to demonstrate that its affirmative action plan will not cause harm. There is good reason for this double standard, however. The harmful effects of the lack of diversity are so obvious and so well-documented that there is no need to prove them. For example, a lack of diversity was one of the causes of the Salem witch trials of 1692. For an extended period of time, Salem's population was completely homogeneous. The community was completely isolated from the outside world, and no newcomers were allowed to settle there. This caused a breakdown in the community's social structure. The community became paranoid, and neighbor turned against neighbor. Many of the trials were instigated by people who accused others of witchcraft simply to settle old scores. As the above example shows, there is a clear and present danger in the lack of diversity. But the danger is not the only issue. The lack of diversity may also have a subtle effect on students. In the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case, the court ruled that separate is inherently unequal. This means that a homogeneous learning environment is inherently unequal. The lack of diversity puts the students in an environment that is not as good as it could be. Many people believe that the lack of diversity has a subtle effect on students. One of the most famous advocates of this idea was the late University of Texas professor Lino Graglia. In a 1997 interview with the Texas Monthly, Graglia said that the lack of diversity on a college campus creates a ""monoculture"" that has a ""disturbing"" effect on the students. ""They become very conformist,"" Graglia said. ""They all believe the same thing. They all think the same way. They have no intellectual curiosity. They have no respect for anyone who is not like them."" The effects of the lack of diversity on students is a subject that has not received enough attention in the affirmative action debate. It is an issue that must be considered before a reasonable conclusion can be reached."

LLAMA,cmv-257,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion to people being shot. Here is the thing, we can care about more than one thing at a time. I can care about the lion and still be an advocate for children. I can care about the lion and still be an advocate for women. I can care about the lion and still be an advocate for the homeless. I can care about the lion and still care about a host of other issues. People don't like to be told to care about an issue and then they come back with the line that they are working on something else. It is the ""look, Squirrel"" of the social media world. It is the ""hey look over here, look at this, don't look at that"" tactic. The same thing happens in marriages and families. I remember the first time my wife and I had a disagreement about something and I gave her the old, ""why are you mad about this, I did the dishes, and took out the trash"" line. I have to admit that it worked, but not for long. This is what I have learned about arguments, discussions, disagreements, and fights. A lot of the time, it is about something more than the issue at hand. A few years ago, my wife was mad about something I said. She didn't like the way I said it. I said, "" I don't like the way you did this either"" and I gave her an example. She said ""we can talk about that another time, but I am upset about what you said."" So, we talked about the real issue. She felt hurt, and when she is hurt, she usually gets angry. It is a coping mechanism for her. That doesn't make it right, it is just how she deals with hurt feelings. She has a choice to make, and she chose to get angry. When I read about the lion and the outrage on social media, I read a lot of posts about people who felt hurt. I am not going to get into the politics of hunting, but the outrage was more about being upset over the killing of something that couldn't defend itself. The outrage is more about the people in the video. The outrage is about the arrogance. The outrage is about killing something that people think is beautiful. The outrage is about killing something for sport. That is what the outrage is about. It is about people being upset about the fact that an animal was killed and could do nothing about it. I think a lot of people who were upset over the death of the lion are not against hunting, they are not against the death of animals. They are upset that someone could kill an animal and not care about it. They are upset that someone could think it is funny to kill a defenseless animal. They are upset that someone could be so arrogant as to think that they are better than the animal. So, yes, I can care about the lion and care about racism, women's rights, abortion, and a host of other issues. I also can care about all of these issues and still care about the lion."
PaLM,cmv-257,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn’t care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to speciesism. They say that we should be focusing on the human victims of the conflict in Zimbabwe, or on the plight of other animals that are being killed in much greater numbers. I think that these criticisms are misguided. First of all, it is possible to care about more than one thing at a time. Just because we are concerned about the death of a single lion does not mean that we are not also concerned about the human victims of the conflict in Zimbabwe. In fact, I would argue that our concern for the lion is a reflection of our concern for all sentient beings. Secondly, the fact that other animals are being killed in much greater numbers does not mean that we should not care about the death of this one lion. Every life is precious, and every death is a tragedy. We should not allow the scale of a tragedy to determine our response to it. Finally, I think that the criticisms of the lion uproar are motivated by a desire to silence those who speak out against animal cruelty. By accusing us of being racist or speciesist, they are trying to discredit our arguments and prevent us from making progress on this issue. I refuse to be silenced. I will continue to speak out against animal cruelty, no matter what the critics say. I believe that all animals deserve to be treated with respect, and I will not rest until we achieve a world where all animals are free from cruelty. Here are some additional thoughts on the issue of animal cruelty:  Animal cruelty is a serious problem that is often overlooked. According to the Humane Society of the United States, over 10 million animals are abused or neglected each year in the United States alone.  Animal cruelty can take many forms, from neglect and abuse to fighting and slaughter. Animals may be subjected to physical pain, psychological trauma, or even death.  Animal cruelty is not just a problem for animals—it is also a problem for humans. Studies have shown that people who abuse animals are more likely to commit other crimes, such as violence against people.  We can all help to stop animal cruelty by speaking out against it, supporting animal welfare organizations, and making choices that are kind to animals. Let us all work together to create a world where all animals are treated with respect."

Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to bad press, but I think it's more than just those things. It's also the idea of causing something that's good for an animal and then not having any intention or desire to do anything after it happens - leaving them in their natural habitat. It's important to consider how we feed animals before deciding whether or not they should be kept as pets. After all, we've done so much damage already!"
Eleuther-AI,cmv-257,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to crime etc..blah blah.. My question is: why should we be scared? Is there any basis for our fear or worries, and what are they based on anyway?! We're just humans!! I am so tired hearing how its unfair being attacked out here in Africa when she's doing her vital job! She has no right thinking bad things like raping other animals after defending herself against lions who chase you down as if your prey... The country will soon see life without wildlife unless these irresponsible idiots start taking action now before it becomes extinct!! It won't take long i guess....and then everybody can go back home saying ""my God those were some dangerous times"" but not many would remember WHY????!!! What happened????"
Tsinghua,cmv-257,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to environmentalism to corporate money, but the more I read about the situation, the more I see it as a ""white guy"" issue. This is why I'm putting this article up here, because I think it's important to understand that the only people that this lion is going to serve as an example for are people of European descent. I think the reason why this is the case is because of how the lion was marketed. Let's say that there was a white lion in Africa that was being sold as a pet. The only people that would care about that lion would be people of European descent. This is because of how white people are portrayed in the media. We see white people as the ""normal"" people and we see other races as ""other."" The lion would be the ""other"" in this scenario. This would be the same situation if a black lion was being sold in a pet store. The only people that would care about the black lion would be people of African descent. This is because of how black people are portrayed in the media. We see black people as the ""other"" and we see other races as ""normal."" The black lion would be the ""other"" in this scenario. This would be the same situation if a black lion was being sold in a pet store. In this scenario, I don't think anyone would care.

OpenAI,cmv-257,I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to poverty. What are your thoughts on this matter?
Human,cmv-257,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. I find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we caretalk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important? Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing. People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X rather than help either argument. Edit This is about society's problems and public conversations rather than individual problems. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
